{"original_text": "Title: A Brilliant Portrayal of Lenny Bruced's Complex and Tragic Life \"Lenny,\" directed by Robert Altman and released in 1974, is a powerful biographical drama that masterfully captures the complex and tragic life of Lenny Bruce, the controversial and pioneering comedian. Dustin Hoffman delivers an exceptional and riveting performance as Lenny Bruce, bringing the comedian's charisma, vulnerability, and raw intensity to the big screen. The film brilliantly explores Lenny's personal struggles with addiction, relationships, and the law, while also highlighting his groundbreaking use of comedy to tackle taboo subjects such as politics, race, and sex. Altman's direction is masterful, creating a realistic and immersive experience that draws the audience into Lenny's world. The supporting cast, including Valerie Perrine and Jan Miner, is exceptional, adding depth and complexity to the story. The cinematography, editing, and production design are all top-notch, making \"Lenny\" a visually stunning and engaging film. However, the film is not without its flaws. At times, the pacing can be slow, and some scenes may feel repetitive. Nevertheless, these minor issues do not detract from the overall brilliance of the film. \"Lenny\" is a must-watch for anyone interested in comedy, biographical films, or complex character studies. It is a moving and thought-provoking film that leaves a lasting impact on the viewer. Hoffman's performance alone is worthy of accolades, and Altman's direction is a masterclass in filmmaking.

The menu isn't extensive, but it's got a good amount of inexpensive sandwiches, salads, and soups. Their Cuban Sandwich ($10 w/ side) was pretty excellent. The bread wasn't the traditional panini-style, but a French baguette...it was still great and had a little crispness to it. All the main ingredients (meat, mustard, pickles, cheese) were in good balance. As a Florida boy who loves his Cuban sandwiches, I would definitely recommend this. I also tried a bit of their Royal Grille, a grilled-chese sandwich with several cheeses, as well as apple slices, on whole grain wheat bread ($8.50 w/ side, extra to add ham/turkey). It was damn good and hit the grilled cheese craving just right. A side salad was also done well. For my side, I chose their \"spicy carrots\" which sounded unique. It consists of sliced raw carrots that have been marinated in a tangy dressing with crushed red pepper, served in a cup. The carrots were cold and crisp and the flavors were fantastic. The spice was just enough to be pleasant. I would definitely get these again. Our food came out super quick and our service was great.

{"original_text": "I thought \"What's New Scooby-Doo\" was pretty bad (yes, I'm sorry to say I didn't like it), since Hanna-Barbera didn't produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series. When I heard \"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue\" was in the works, I thought it could be better. But when I saw a pic of how Scooby and Shaggy were going to appear, I knew this show was going to be bad, if not worse. I watched a few episodes, and believe me, it is just yet another \"Teen Titans\" or \"Loonatics Unleashed\"-wannabe. No longer are Scooby and Shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool, creepy monsters that rob banks. Now they are going after a typical super-villain whom wants to destroy the world. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo have become more brave, too. Also, since Shaggy IS NOT going to be a vegetarian in this series, Casey Kasem (whom actually IS a vegetarian), the original voice of Shaggy, will NOT voice Shaggy. He will only voice Shaggy if he doesn't eat meat, and that was just a stupid corporate-done change to update the franchise, as if the Internet jokes weren't enough. So Scott Menville (whom previously voiced Red Herring on \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\") voices Shaggy here. Believe me, the voice is REALLY BAD! It makes Shaggy sound like a squeaky 10-year-old, and I must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look. However, Kasem DOES voice Shaggy's Uncle Albert, which is a sort of good thing. Scooby-Doo, on the other hand, does not look that well. He seems to have been designed to look more like the CGI Scooby-Doo from the live-action movies. Also, Scooby's Frank Welker voice (need I mention Brain the Dog again?) still hasn't improved. Robi, the robotic butler, is practically worse than Scrappy-Doo! He tries to be funny and does \"comical\" impressions and gives safety tips (\"Remember kids, don't stand under trees during a thunderstorm!\"), but it just doesn't fit into a Scooby-Doo cartoon. Again, the Hanna-Barbera sound effects are rarely used here. However, on one episode, \"Lightning Strikes Twice,\" they use the \"Castle thunder\" thunderclaps during it, almost extensively! (Although they DO still use the newly-recorded thunder sound effects, too.) Scooby-Doo hasn't use \"Castle thunder\" sound effects since 1991. But my question is, why use \"Castle thunder\" on \"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue,\" while NOT use it on the direct-to-video movies or even on \"What's New Scooby-Doo!\" (Two episodes of WNSD used it, and it wasn't enough, unfortunately.) If WNSD and the DTV movies used it, then they might be better than this crappy cartoon. The day this show premiered, I watched the first episode, and it was SO bad I turned it off after only five minutes! To get my mind off of this poor show, I rented \"Scooby-Doo, Pirates Ahoy!\" which came out around the same time. And you know what? The \"Pirates Ahoy\" movie was actually BETTER than \"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue\" (and even better than \"What's New, Scooby-Doo!\") And it looks like the new designs that the characters have isn't permanent to the franchise.

{"original_text": "We were really excited to try the Sunday Brunch. We just moved to Dunedin and have been to many spots on Main Street (Living Room, Casa Tina, Black Pearl, Pisces, Bon Appetite, Sea Sea Riders) and had great food and fun. We got there around noon and it was busy. The hostess was sort of confusing but we told her table for two inside. She gave us a pager and showed us to the bar. The bar seats were full so we sort of stood by the door. We were there around 10 minutes when another couple came in and checked in at the hostess stand and came into the bar to wait. About 20 minutes later I checked in at hostess stand and was surprised they were working off two waiting lists - I thought that was odd. The hostess told me not too much longer. The next couple sat was the couple who came in 10 minutes after us. We were called by the host who proceeded to seat us outside. I told him we had asked for inside he was very nice and apologized saying he thought we were first available but now saw we had asked for inside. As we walked back to the bar we saw the 10 minute arriving after us couple at their inside table and decided to leave. We told the hostess,who really only cared what number our pager was, that we were upset and she seemed not to really care at all. After repeating that I was upset about the couple being sat before us she mumbled something about coming back and trying them again! What?!! Too many places on Main Street for that kind of service.

We just moved to Dunedin and have been to many spots on Main Street (Living Room, Casa Tina, Black Pearl, Pisces, Bon Appetite, Sea Sea Riders) and had great food and fun. We got there around noon and it was busy. The hostess was sort of confusing but we told her table for two inside. She gave us a pager and showed us to the bar. The bar seats were full so we sort of stood by the door. We were there around 10 minutes when another couple came in and checked in at the hostess stand and came into the bar to wait. About 20 minutes later I checked in at hostess stand and was surprised they were working off two waiting lists - I thought that was odd. The hostess told me not too much longer. The next couple sat was the couple who came in 10 minutes after us. We were called by the host who proceeded to seat us outside. I told him we had asked for inside he was very nice and apologized saying he thought we were first available but now saw we had asked for inside. As we walked back to the bar we saw the 10 minute arriving after us couple at their inside table and decided to leave. We told the hostess,who really only cared what number our pager was, that we were upset and she seemed not to really care at all. After repeating that I was upset about the couple being sat before us she mumbled something about coming back and trying them again! What?!! Too many places on Main Street for that kind of service.

{"original_text": "film, directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, is known for its graphic depiction of violence, brutality, and the harsh realities of life in rural Italy during the first half of the 20th century. The movie is divided into three parts, each focusing on a different decade in the history of a wine collective and its inhabitants. The portrayal of the brutal conditions and the unrelenting cycle of violence and suffering might be challenging to watch for some viewers. The film does not pull any punches in depicting the raw humanity of its characters and the harsh realities of their existence. Additionally, the movie's lengthy running time of almost six hours, spread over two days in the theater, might make it an unpleasant experience for some. This, combined with the graphic depictions of violence and poverty, could leave viewers feeling drained and disturbed after watching it.

{"original_text": "Spoilers.....I saw the original on TV sometime ago and remembered this production as less gripping than most Beeb costume drama. I rewatched on DVD this week and still have the same impression of it. It's a good story at first, but weakens when the heroine becomes oh so terribly brave and noble and returns to her utterly vile husband when he's ill and I got so totally irritated with her saintliness. I suppose this was the \"right thing to do\" when the story was written as well as contributing plenty of angst, and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband as marriage made her no more than his possession, let alone to carry on scandalously with a lover as I expect a lot of the modern audience would have liked to see. But it's hard to take the santimoniousness nowadays and especially when this heroine had a strong, brave admirer ready to defend her against anyone and everyone. So re the story as in the film I'm equivocal. It's well done as per the novel, but somewhat irritating as per today's kind of life.Steadfast hero Gilbert was certainly a saint to put up with his ladylove's variable and often cryptic behaviour and persistent self-denial and to be so consistently supportive. So I felt it a great shame that when Helen was at long last free to be with him, the script didn't allow him a bit more than about one minute to fall on each other for a quick hug before the titles came up. This was completely ridiculous when we'd been waiting all this time through all that dripping sentiment over the undeserving husband for a decent bit of dialogue and a good embrace between hero and heroine. Instead, the ending was as though the film makers had run out of time or finance or just couldn't be bothered. \"Here you are - one minute, do what you can in that, then cut as the director wants to go home now.....\" I was left feeling totally dissasatisfied.However, very high commendations to the acting of Toby Stephens a perfect and very handsome hero, and Rupert Graves a superbly nasty and self-pitying villain. Tara Fitzgerald was satisfactory within the confines of the script that forced her to be a depressing and rather sanctimonious victim so much of the time.That said, I love these classic dramas and virtually all of them are a sight better than much of the \"modern\" drama on TV these days.

Brisket tacos, with BBQ sauce (I add the white sauce too), are splendid.

The story starts with Megha waiting at the marriage registration office for Dhiraj to show up but for some reason he does not show up. So Ankush comes in the picture here, who had approached Megha with the intention of earning Rs. 200 for his Witness job and he ends up helping her by providing shelter to her. Ankush grows on his side by working in a bank as an Agent&#8230; Ankush falls in love with Megha and she too falls in love with him (or kind of love), both agree for the marriage and Dhiraj comes back in the picture. Unexpected circumstances happen, actually I should say, expected circumstances with unexpected reactions and then&#8230;.Actually the movie story is bit different than the movies we see and I do not think so it will be accepted by the masses but if you are a movie freak like me and love to watch something different, then you will definitely like the movie. The movie is just an innocent love story drafted very well by the characters of Abhay Deol and Soha Ali Khan. The characters are so natural that you feel as if things are happening to the guy next door. The background music of the film also plays a very good role, it is just too good. The way Delhi is shown is very good and gives a fresh feeling.so let's cut it out and sum it up.Story: A very common story carried very well and transformed to a wonderful experience.Music: Well, as it was Himesh Reshammiya creation, so I did not expect much but still I liked couple of songs of the movie including the Qawwali.Acting: Abhay Deol was the most impressive, very natural and innocent acting but he should stay away from singing in the songs. Soha Ali Khan, she is a doll, a very cute doll I must say. Again very innocent and natural acting and these both actors perfectly fit into their characters. Apart from these two, Shayan Munshi needs some acting lessons and may be few layers of fat to cover the bones. Other actors did their job well.Stars: I would also give it 3.5 stars out of 5. You will enjoy the movie if watched in the theatre, I would recommend watching it in theatre if you are a movie freak and accept uncommon stories. Otherwise wait for the DVD to arrive.

{"original_text": "Title: \"The Meaning of Life\" - A Thought-Provoking Journey beyond the Grasp of Reason \"The Meaning of Life,\" written and directed by Terry Gilliam, is a cinematic tour de force that challenges the very fabric of our existential understanding. A witty, irreverent, and brilliantly executed exploration of life's ultimate purpose and the absurdity of the human condition, this film is a testament to Gilliam's audacious storytelling and dark, twisted humor. Throughout this labyrinthine adventure, we are introduced to the misadventures of various eccentric characters who, in their individual quirks and foibles, reflect our own paradoxical existence. The narrative is both an homage to and a deconstruction of classic philosophical thought, melding the wisdom of thinkers from Nietzsche to Aristotle into a captivating, often bizarre narrative. Visually, \"The Meaning of Life\" is a rich tapestry of breathtaking inventiveness and surrealism. One scene takes place in a bar where the patrons are human-sized flies, while another features a massively pregnant woman giving birth to several elephants. Each vignette is a testament to Gilliam's ability to conjure visuals that seem to defy logic, and yet are somehow entirely believable within the film's surrealistic framework. But \"The Meaning of Life\" is more than just a visual feast; it is a thought-provoking, poignant, and often hilarious examination of the human experience. This daring, intelligent, and unforgettable cinematic triumph leaves us with a profound sense of awe and a newfound appreciation for life's beautiful, absurd complexity. Ultimately, this masterpiece poses more questions than it answers, inviting us to ponder the meaning of existence long after the final credits roll.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Terry Gilliam's film \"The Meaning of Life\" is a thought-provoking exploration of the meaning of life and the absurdity of the human condition, directed by Terry Gilliam and starring Jim Broadbent, Tilda Swinton, Michael Sheen, John Hurt, and Bill Nighy, in cinemas on Friday, 17 October.)

{"original_text": "So on the Chills Network on cable they are having \"Vampire Month\", I'm such a dork, but I love vampires. So after a few duds that they showed I was pretty disappointed, but then I noticed Sleepwalkers was written by Stephen King. So I decided to go ahead and check it out, well much to my surprise, this movie was really bad. Most Stephen King films are entertaining and some are very scary. While Sleepwalkers was bad, it was a beautiful kind of bad. I had a good time laughing at this movie and just taking it for what it was. I've never read Sleepwalkers, from what I understand this is the only real vampire story by King, so I can't really compare book to film. I don't know if it was just my TV, but Sleepwalkers looked like it was made for TV. The special effects were corny and the story was a bit far fetched, even if it is fantasy, it had a lot of problems. Charles Brady and his mother Mary are vampires who feed off the life force of virgin women. They are considerably more resilient than humans and have powers of both telekinesis and illusion. Their one weakness is cats, who are not only able to see through their illusions but whose claws are capable of inflicting severe to fatal wounds upon them. They also maintain an incestuous relationship. Charles and Mary have taken up residence in a small Indiana town. Charles attends the local high school, and there he meets Tanya Robertson in his creative writing class. Tanya does not suspect the real reason why Charles wants her so much; to take her life force for his mother, who is starving. At first, it seems that Charles has fallen in love with Tanya. On their first date, however, a picnic at the nearby cemetery, Charles attempts to drain the life force from Tanya while kissing her. As it happens, Deputy Sheriff Andy Simpson who had earlier tried to pull Charles over for speeding, drives by the cemetery and notices Charles' car. When Tanya runs to him for help, Charles tracks Andy down and kills him. When Charles then turns to resume his life force-depleting make out session with Tanya, the deputy's cat, Clovis, rises to the occasion and nearly kills Charles by scratching him in the face and chest. Mortally wounded by Clovis, Charles staggers back home to Mary. Mary then seeks vengeance on Tanya's family.So to sum this movie up basically you should expect the cheese to overflow. The scene where Charles attacks Tanya for the first time is very clich\u00e9 and you almost vote for Charles to win just because Tanya is one of the dumbest female leads in horror movies. Then you gotta love the scene where Mary has a gun and shoots it at a cop car and somehow the whole thing explodes, God bless Hollywood explosions and exaggerations. I'm taking the movie for what it is, it's just so deliciously bad that it turns into a dark comedy for me that I could just enjoy making fun of.

{"original_text": "it didn't fully live up to my expectations. The concept of the film, where the protagonist discovers that aliens have infiltrated society by disguising themselves as humans, is intriguing. However, I felt that the execution could have been better. The special effects looked outdated, and some of the acting was subpar. Additionally, the message of the film seemed heavy-handed at times. I was expecting a more nuanced exploration of the themes of consumerism and conformity, instead, it felt a bit simplistic. Despite these criticisms, there are still some aspects of the film that I appreciated. The action scenes were well-choreographed, and the final confrontation between the protagonist and the aliens was intense. John Carpenter's score, as always, was excellent.

The wings were plump, cooked to perfection and smothered in a sublime hot sauce. After the wings, the burgers arrived with the French fries, both pleasant to the eyes. After the first bite, I knew I would be coming back to DM Brewery again. The high quality burger was cooked very well with the correct ratio of toppings. To top it off, it was burger and beer night for $10. Every night, DM Brewery has some sort of special deal going on. They also have a good modern rewards program using an iphone/android app. This is a great place to go with friends if your looking for a fun modern upscale atmosphere."}

{"original_text": "I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best television sci-fi series made. Both stand out in my mind because unlike early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK:TNG, they were fine shows, but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes. In many ways, you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring. This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that took up all of the final season) and the other TREK shows, as there was more of a larger story that unified them. This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form. Sure, there were a few \"throwaway\" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny.And speaking of funny, I loved that SG-1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasn't so dreadfully serious. In this way, I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of Homer Simpson--it's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons.To truly appreciate SG-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work. This coherence gives the show exceptional staying power.

I like some of Tony Scott's work, also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie, even though I heard otherwise from other people. But this was simply hopeless. In my humble opinion, Tony Scott was trying too hard. It was all just too much. Allow me to elaborate. Miss Knightley was overacting, and not in a good way. The people who did perform well, were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez, and Christopher Walken, but their screen time just wasn't able to save the movie. There were a few scenes that jumped out in their originality, yet somehow it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer. A certain tune was used around 4 times, which really started to bug after the second time. I'm a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once. Also, the editing really went out on this one, as the cutting rate is rather high. Oh, and the repetitive echoing of some of Keira's lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second, third, fourth time, and so on.

The film introduces us to a new setting that is both visually stunning and culturally rich. The breathtaking landscapes, elaborate set pieces, and stunning special effects transport us to a world of adventure and intrigue. The storyline, while not as linear as its predecessor, is filled with twists and turns that keep us on the edge of our seats. The characters are compelling, with Indiana Jones once again portrayed by Harrison Ford in his inimitable style. This time, Jones is joined by a new companion, Willie Scott, played by Kate Capshaw. While some critics have questioned her character's development, I believe she adds a layer of vulnerability and complexity to the tale. The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular, with an elevated level of danger and intensity.

{"original_text": "This is a great movie. It has a captivating story, an awesome main character, very good acting and killer action. This takes place mostly in the year 2036 but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story.The story is very well done and there are no holes. Kurt Russell is a solider named Todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all of the other soldiers have never had normal lives. Eventually the military introduces newer, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. Jason Scott Lee being one of them. As a result they don't have any need for the old soldiers like Todd. They test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers, in the battle Russell is injured and assumed to be dead. The military dumps his body as well as a fewer others assuming they are all dead but what they don't realize is that Russell is alive.Todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him on. For a while he lives there but can't adjust to normal life. He rarely says a word and he is at times very aggressive towards the other people. When they feel he is a danger to them they send him off to the desert.Just as Russell's leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers. What the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like Todd and the other old soldiers. So while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd easily outsmarts them. The military starts realizing this and Todd kills all of their men but one. That one is Jason Scott Lee and in the end you see a classic fight scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell obviously comes out on top.This is one of the best action films I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. This has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines. The writer also didn't forget that Russell had never seen a woman before as he calls even women \"sir\". There are no holes in this film, every minute has a purpose and it's very entertaining.An awesome one man army action film for fans of Rambo, Commando and Missing In Action. This is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and action/sci-fi fans.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This is a great movie.

{"original_text": "I Am Curious is really two films in one - half of it is the sexual experimental side of Lena and the other half is her curiosity with political/socialism. Whatever the director's intention, the two don't really mesh together. The director should have just stuck with the romantic side of Lena and made a separate movie for the politics. There is a bizarre mixture of political/war rallies, Dr. King, serious political interviews, flopping breasts, and pubic hair. The film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie. Other than the interesting sex scenes, you'll be bored dry watching this film. Unlike many other reviewers, I think the nude/sexual scenes are overdone for what it is. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better choices. The pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is. I think the cast did a fine job however.

{"original_text": "So much is wrong with this abysmal little wet fart of a movie that it's hard to know where to begin.First of all, it's a remarkably un-scary scary movie, even by Amercian standards. The dialogue is clich\u00e9, the characters are two-dimensional, the writing is ho-hum, and what little story there is is neither coherent nor remotely interesting.We meet the following stereotypes in order: Balding Loser Guy (probably divorced, but who knows? This movie doesn't tell us) with a brave heart, the Young Hero (who doesn't do anything heroic at all), Brave Little Kid (with a homicidal streak a mile wide) and Black Bad-Ass Bitch (with more brawn than brains). These guys take up an ongoing fight with the Tall Scary Reaper Man and his evil Ewoks.Oh, and the film is full of wicked little metal orbs whoosing around menacing people. Given a chance, they perform impromptu brain surgery on those who doen't have the mental acuity to duck when they come at them. Booh! Actually, one of them is haunted by a good ghost (but then again, it might be a deceitful spectre) who seems intent on helping our Brave Contagonists retrieve their young kidnapped friend.There is no character background or even an introduction to any of the characters. It starts with some kind of recap of the ending of the previous movie, but this doesn't explain a lot. If you've seen the first two movies, fine. Otherwise you don't know who these people are, how they are related, why they aren't in school or at work, or why you should care whether they live or die. Consequently, you don't. The only point of interest becomes any splatter effects. And there aren't enough of those to keep you awake.Of potenial interest/amusement are the three Raider Punks, as stupid as they are evil, who menace Our Heroes. But they don't get much screen time. They are offed almost immediately. Then they are buried (why anybody should take the time is beyond me), then they appear again as Evil Raider Punk Zombies. Only to be offed again, literally within a minute.The rest of the movie mainly seems to consist of Caspar the Friendly Ghost appearing and disappearing, driving around looking for places, and Balding Loser trying to score som Bad Black Bitch Booty, using pickup lines that would embarrass a mentally retarded teenager. No dice there; not even some gratuitous sex could have saved this movie, so good thing there never is any.The head baddie, called the Tall Man, doesn't manage to scare anyone older than 3 years; howling \"Booooy!\" every five minutes isn't enough. Why he, with his amazing telekinetic powers and uncanny upper-body strength, doesn't simply squash our heroes like bugs isn't explained. Instead, he delegates the job to his inept retarded little minions, who never manage to kill anyone before being shot to hell.Filmgoers who like masterpieces like \"Friday 13th part XXXXVIII: Jason goes to college\" might find some entertainment.

Lube & Auto for an oil change and some minor repairs on my car. From the moment I arrived, the atmosphere felt less than welcoming. The waiting area was cluttered and dimly lit, and the air quality seemed poor. The interaction with the staff was less than ideal. While they were efficient in getting my car serviced, their communication was minimal, leaving me wondering about the status of my vehicle and the cost of repairs. I also felt that there was a lack of transparency in the pricing. While I understand that unexpected repairs can add up, I would have appreciated being given a clearer explanation of the costs involved before the work was done. Overall, my experience at A.K. Lube & Auto left me feeling unsatisfied and uncomfortable. While their work may have been competent, the lack of attention to customer service and communication left a negative impression. I would urge the management of A.K.

The film opens with a calm and unassuming news team, investigative journalist Jack Godell (Michael Douglas) and cameraman Richard Adams (Jake Gittes alumnus, Jack Nicols), exploring an unusual incident at a nuclear power plant. But what seems like a routine report soon unravels into a labyrinth of corporate cover-ups, government collusion, and potentially catastrophic consequences. Bridges masterfully builds tension, allowing the story to simmer with subtle suspense before erupting into a dramatic finale. The stunning performances by the lead actors lend themselves beautifully to the real-life issues at hand, making this more than just a film - it's a wake-up call. The China Syndrome brilliantly scrutinizes the nuclear industry, offering a scathing commentary on corporate greed and the price society pays for progress. It's a chilling reminder that sometimes, the truth really is stranger - and more dangerous - than fiction.

The hauntingly beautiful cinematography, powerful performance by Klaus Kinski, and a hypnotic musical score transport viewers into a world where the impossible becomes possible.

{"original_text": "Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.None of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either.

The reason for my enjoyment was the combination of convenient location, comfortable accommodations, and friendly staff.

We were within walking distance to several popular attractions, restaurants, and shops. The proximity to the stadium was particularly convenient for us, as we were there for a music festival. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the friendly and welcoming staff who checked us in efficiently. Our room was clean and spacious, with all the necessary amenities including a comfortable bed, air conditioning, and a refreshing bathroom. The included continental breakfast was a nice touch and provided a good start to the day. One of the standout features of Quality Inn Nashville Downtown - Stadium was their event planning and services. We were there for a small family gathering and the staff went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly. They were responsive to our requests and took care of the setup and cleanup, allowing us to focus on enjoying the event.

{"original_text": "In a future society, the military component does not have to recruit; rather, their candidates are chosen at birth, culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government. They are given over to the war machine, body and soul, for no reason other than to protect and serve; they have no personal identity other than a name and rank, and no autonomy whatsoever. This is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in `Soldier,' directed by Paul Anderson and starring Kurt Russell. The scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time, from preadolescence to adulthood. Russell is Sergeant Todd, the best of the best, and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign; he is what he was born to be, a soldier. But even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives when Todd and his peers are no longer the elite. A new generation of soldiers has been created, products of advanced genetics and technology, and Todd's generation is suddenly obsolete. What follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life, while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality, traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life: Fear and discipline. Russell gives a commanding performance as Todd, the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts. He has few lines in this movie, but Russell speaks volumes with his eyes. This role demonstrates that he is, in fact, one of the under-appreciated actors of our times; that he can disappear so entirely into the character of Todd is a credit to his ability, and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before. And he's given Todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype. Notable performances are also turned in here by Connie Nielsen (Sandra) and Jason Isaacs (Colonel Mekum). Rounding out the supporting cast are Jason Scott Lee, memorable as Caine 607, one of the new generation of soldiers; Sean Pertwee (Mace); Gary Busey (Captain Church); Michael Chiklis (Jimmy Pig); and Mark Bringleson (Rubrick). Anderson has delivered an action film with a message, a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science-fiction. `Soldier' reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact. It's an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives, like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference.

Much like `1984,' and `Mad Max,' this movie, which is ultimately uplifting, is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of Universe in which we all must live together and share. I rate this one 7/10."}

Questions you will be asking yourself throughout the movie.The film first caught my attention while I was cruising the Horror section in HMV. I was tired of all the so called \"terrifiying\" Hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different. The cover art for Satan's Little Helper immediately caught my attention. As you can see, the image draws you in - it's chilling! I knew it was a straight to DVD release - but I took a chance. I mean, I just seen \"Boogey Man\" the night before - so It couldn't get any worse! After I watched the movie, I was semi-satisfied. I loved the plot of the movie. It was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend, so he could kill. In some sick deranged way, he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners - a duo of terror. It was a great idea to set the film on Halloween night. This way, no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid. They would simply think he was his guardian. But, this is also where the \"plot holes\" begin to surface.If your son came home with a \"friend\" he met trick or treating - that's fine. You wouldn't think anything of it - if he was 9!, or round about the same age as him. If however, he appeared with a strange man in a mask, you would be startled and protective of your child. You would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself. You would ask why he is with your son. He doesn't know him. You would tell him to please leave. He isn't a family friend. He's a stranger. Now, we're supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers. In this case, the mum is completely fine with it. Huh? They never seem to think it's a tad odd that the \"man\" doesn't speak - at all. Gruanted they think it's the daughters boyfriend, but after 10 minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he's not saying a word.The film goes down hill from there. The thing that got me the most was, all the mum said was \"Do you want some cider?\". I can't count how many times she says this in the movie. It's like, oh you're dying - we have cider though, it's all good!! The movie started promising, and failed to deliver. It was more of a horror/comedy, and even as that it fails to deliver.

With Max(Jessica Alba) as an escaped X-5, manticore creation, trying to adapt to a normal life, but still \"saving the world\".

The plot kinda disappeared, and the series lost a little of it's charm, mostly because of all the weird \"creatures\" appearing. Don't get me wrong the second season is good, but with a little bit to much of the \"manticores\". However, they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season 2, in which I had a lot of hopes to see more of.So I really wish they could start making new episodes.

Totally clean comedian. He has actually won the San Francisco comedy festival twice -the only person to ever have done that with two different hours of material. No I don't work for Don but he always impresses me. The acts from start to finish were terrific. And the food is great which says something bc a lot of comedy clubs just do crappy bar food: I had ahi and oysters which I was hesitating about but had no reason to. The food was greatl.

{"original_text": "One of the worst customer service I have ever experienced at any Toyota service center! Twice in the past half year, I have had very poor customer service here. The first time was when I bought my car in specifically asking for an inspection of my right front tire, informing them it had been leaking air a few days ago and I had to pull over to get air pumped in. They found nothing.... only 2 days later, that same tire went completely flat. I took my car to a local auto shop, and they found a huge nail stuck in the tire that would've been found if Toyota had done a careful inspection the first time. Second experience was even worse and more shocking. I took my car in for servicing on a Saturday morning. The service person could not answer many of my questions, and when he stated that he was new, I kindly asked him how long he'd been working there (thinking that if he was so new that he didn't know a lot of info, that I'd ask another representative to help me). Out of nowhere, he yelled out in an extremely rude and angry manner, \"That's none of your business!.... I won't have you harrassing me...\" Everyone in the room was startled and turned around to see why he was shouting so loudly. Perhaps he acted this way because there was no manager on duty, however, this behavior is customer service at its worst. As a person in the service industry myself (I am a physician and my patients' health, safety and satisfaction come first), I am shocked by his blatantly inappropriate and unacceptable behavior. This behavior reflects poorly on his company, and I hope nothing like this happens to any other customers in the future. I went to another shop to have my car serviced, where customers would be treated more politely and with respect.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "One of the worst customer service I have ever experienced at any Toyota service center!

{"original_text": "David Lynch usually makes films that resemble puzzles put together the wrong way. They are interesting to look at and think about but they really don't gel in your mind. Perhaps art will always mean the most to its creator.The Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch film. Not that there's anything typical about them anyway. It's an odyssey through rural America. A real life journey Alvin Straight took on a lawn mower to get to his brothers house. He rode 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin to make amends to his sick brother for past offenses.At the heart of this film is sweet voiced Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin Straight right to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film is slow paced matches Alvin's slow journey toward realization.Along the way Alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl. She is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation. After listening to Alvin speak about family she reconsiders.Later Alvin witnesses a distraught woman kill a deer with her car. She complains that she has killed several and leaves. Alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook up some dear meat that night.Later Alvin's lawn mower loses its brakes and nearly kills him. A nice man and his wife let him stay in their yard while he gets it fixed. They even let him call his sweet but slow daughter, nicely played by Sissy Spacek, whose haunted by a terrible tragedy in her own past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The man even offers to drive Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin declines with thanks.While Alvin waits he also goes off to a bar with a kindly old man as they discuss the harshness of war and the price it took on their souls. Alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper that has forever haunted him.Alvin also encounters two bickering brothers who've repaired his lawn mower. He talks them down in price wisely calling them on their high labor and repair costs. He even helps them to appreciate one another learning from his own mistakes with his brother.The night before Alvin leaves the man's yard he takes his hat off to him. The man tells him it was an honor having him stay and asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in it's simplicity. It's heartfelt because it's so straight, so real.The journey continues and we can't help to get more and more involved with it. We want Alvin to get to his brothers. We want him to make amends.

You can't help but to understand his pride, to listen to his wisdom, and to ultimately feel his pain.

{"original_text": "Several friends and I continued our mini-pub crawl of mixology bars (begun at Franklin Mortgage and Investment Co.) here. Good move! We parked it at the bar and got the show from Sasha, the bartender, who kept up friendly banter with us even as she concocted a variety of beverages throughout the course of our stay. The cocktail menu was fairly extensive, broken down into Prohibition- and Repeal-era drinks, not to mention long lists of bourbons, ryes, and scotches. I ordered an Aviation (a drink I make myself, with my own brandied cherries, but here they do it the right way, all out with Creme de Violette to tint it blue like the sky; Sasha let me take a look at the bottle, perhaps to know that it wasn't some awful curacao!) For another friend she created a drink with Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction's Root liqueur (which is made with the roots and herbs used in old-fashioned root beer), chocolate bitters, seltzer and orange. We also partook of food here: First, duck fat fries (which have been a trend in Chicago, where I live, for at least a year, but I'd never had them; I'd never eaten anything involving duck before this, so now I suppose I have lost my duck fat innocence). These were thick-cut, rich in taste [gratis the duck fat, one presumes], not actually greasy, but definitely better when ordered with the cup of cheese sauce on the side. We also got soft pretzel sticks, which would have been fine but not especially remarkable without the mustard sauce (which had a distinct taste of raspberry, to my mind) pooled in the cup underneath them.

I ordered an Aviation (a drink I make myself, with my own brandied cherries, but here they do it the right way, all out with Creme de Violette to tint it blue like the sky; Sasha let me take a look at the bottle, perhaps to know that it wasn't some awful curacao!) For another friend she created a drink with Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction's Root liqueur (which is made with the roots and herbs used in old-fashioned root beer), chocolate bitters, seltzer and orange. We also partook of food here: First, duck fat fries (which have been a trend in Chicago, where I live, for at least a year, but I'd never had them; I'd never eaten anything involving duck before this, so now I suppose I have lost my duck fat innocence). These were thick-cut, rich in taste [gratis the duck fat, one presumes], not actually greasy, but definitely better when ordered with the cup of cheese sauce on the side. We also got soft pretzel sticks, which would have been fine but not especially remarkable without the mustard sauce (which had a distinct taste of raspberry, to my mind) pooled in the cup underneath them. Overall, this was a friendly place with fab drinks and great food. I wish it was in my city."}

{"original_text": "A unique film...one of the best of all time. Acting, script, Quincy Jones' score, cinematography, editing, etc. -- just fantastic. As most viewers know, this movie is based on Truman Capote's book about the famous murder of a Kansas farm family (the Clutters) by a couple of young guys during a misguided robbery. I've never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into a riveting film. The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team pursuing them. Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is amazing. Cocky, twitchy, and devoid of compassion he comes across so charming, oily and plausible. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is extraordinary as well -- lonely, and at once empathetic and cold-blooded. Who could fold these characteristics into one individual and make us buy it? He does, and it's brilliant! A key point of the book is how it took the intersection of these two very differently sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and heinous crime, and these two actors make it work beautifully. Both had moments in their subsequent careers, but these performances are high water marks, and that stands for acting period. The cops are wonderful too. Leading the investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are great as well. Unlike contemporary movies where producers feel it necessary to endow police with superhuman assets or foibles, these are just genuine flatfeet, working the case with determination and competence. They seem so real. I've never seen cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity; and I've seen most of the crime classics going way back. Really one of a kind in this respect. PARTIAL SPOILER COMING (this movie's unique in that you already know what's happened, but I'm warning for the record). Of course, the best scenes from the best crime shows and movies are the interrogations -- the intellectual fencing matches between the cops and the crooks, Mano a Mano. This movie has hands down the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see on film. Watch Dick and Perry try to bluff their way through and slowly unravel, unaware the cops have the goods on them. But the cops need to deftly prep their suspects to fracture their alibis and hopefully elicit confessions. This is some of the best acting you'll ever see. Think Glengarry Glen Ross without the showboating. To help translate the sad and horrific angles of this true story, ICB was filmed at the actual Clutter house, and I've heard the Clutters were played by film students to give them a genuine feel. It works. These seem like decent, simple folk. It makes the crime so palpable and sad. I'll stop here.

Now imagine Peter Griffin as a(admittedly slim and minus the glasses) woman, except that he now lacks the something that made him hilarious. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he doesn't know he's an idiot. Sarah has none of the genuine character, none of the acting ability to pull her character off. Maybe its the trite, formulaic jokes that pull her comedy even lower than her character can take it by herself. Maybe it's the lack of believable foils. Her insensitive, bigoted persona may appeal to insensitive, bigoted people unlike the mass appeal that Stephen Colbert's insensitive, bigoted character has. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates an annoying, unfunny character. She lacks something that is necessary for the genre of satire, let alone for the entire world of comedy. What Sarah Silverman lacks, its noticeable. And when you don't believe it and identify with it, it's not funny anymore."}

The beauty and spa area was equally chaotic, with products stacked haphazardly on shelves and no clear pricing information available.

An opening title tells us they work for ComTeg, then adds with obvious tongue in cheek \"...the thought the CIA might employ such an organization for any purpose is, of course, preposterous.\" That's a pretty clever way of letting the audience know all bets are off.Add to that a traditionally strong Peckinpah backup cast, including Burt Young, Gig Young, and Peckinpah regular Bo Hopkins in the plum role of a madman who can't pass up an opportunity to be shot at for $500 a day, and you only wish that the scriptwriters, including the celebrated Sterling Silliphant, tried to do something more with the story than turn it into a platform for lazy one-liners and bad chop-socky knockoffs.

We're 40 minutes into the film before we get our first battle scene, a completely chaotic collection of random shots where a bunch of people we haven't even met before are seen fighting at San Francisco Airport, their battle intercut with a conversation in an office suite.By the end of the film, what's left of the cast is having a battle inside a fleet of mothballed Victory Ships, ninjas running out in the open to be gunned down while Caan tosses off one liners that undercut any hint of real suspense. \"Lay me seven-to-five, I'll take the little guy,\" he wisecracks just before a climatic samurai duel between two ninja warriors - from China, which we all know is the land of the Ninja. (The battle takes place in San Francisco, but surprisingly no Mounties arrive to break things up.)Caan is much better in smaller scenes, like when Locken, recovering from some nasty injuries, is told by one of his bosses, played by a smooth Arthur Hill, that he's been \"Humpty-dumped\" by the organization. Caan refuses to stay down, and his recovery scenes, though momentum-killing for the movie, feature fine acting from him and Amy Heflin, Van's daughter, as a supportive nurse.

{"original_text": "Title: A Laugh Out Loud Revisit with ALF ALF, or \"Alien Life Formula,\" was an unexpectedly charming and hilarious television show that graced our small screens in the late 1980s. For those unfamiliar with this extraterrestrial tale, prepare to embark on a wild and wacky journey with Gordon Shumway, a mischievous alien disguised as a household robot, who crash-lands in the garage of the Tanner family. The show's innovative premise immediately grabbed our attention, and the combination of science fiction and slapstick comedy was a perfect blend that had us laughing out loud week after week. With each new episode, ALF provided us with a fresh dose of absurdity, from his quirky mannerisms to his comically misinterpreted attempts at human interaction. Max Wright, who portrayed the patient yet exasperated father character Willie Tanner, delivered a performance that grounded the eccentricity of the show, allowing it to resonate on both a comedic and emotional level. Adding to the show's appeal were the delightful and awkward romantic entanglements between the Tanner children and their alien friend. Throughout the series, ALF provided valuable life lessons, tackling topics such as dealing with adversity, the importance of friendship, and the complexities of growing up. Decades later, ALF continues to be a source of amusement, capturing the hearts and minds of new generations. This timeless gem is a must-watch, not only for its comedic brilliance but for the enduring joy it brings to families and fans alike.

{"original_text": "This is such a fantastic movie, a Western about a self-concerned man (Jimmy Stewart) going up to the Klondike for gold. On the way, he gets hassled by a local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, giving a wonderfully evil performance), whom he hassles back. McIntire threatens that he'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town, which is, unfortunately, the only way back to the States. The main chunk of the story is about the peaceful Klondike town of Dawson being turned upside down by new residents from McIntire's town. Ruth Roman, for instance, who has come with Stewart and his two companions (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, who plays Stewart's best friend), builds a saloon (a Hollywood front for a whorehouse) and tries to run the town's restaurant and hang-out place out of business. She paves the way for McIntire and his goons to come up, too. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the peaks of the Western genre, The Naked Spur. The Far Country is just the tiniest bit less, and it contains 99.9% of what made that film so special without, of course, feeling like a cheap copy. Like The Naked Spur, The Far Country boasts beautiful, on-location cinematography. The landscape is gorgeous. Stewart gives one of his best performances (nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954, Rear Window).

Still, Stewart plays it so damn well, he makes this character very human. And the supporting performances are universally fantastic. In addition to those I've mentioned, the adorable French actress Corinne Calvet is very good. And I ought to single out Walter Brennen, as well. He seems to have specialized in playing best friends. His relationship with Stewart is very touching, since he is, at first, the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man. The screenplay is very well written, and Mann's direction is impeccable. A masterpiece. 10/10.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This is such a fantastic movie, a Western about a self-concerned man (Jimmy Stewart) going up to the Klondike for gold. On the way, he gets hassled by a local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, giving a wonderfully evil performance), whom he hassles back. McIntire threatens that he'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town, which is, unfortunately, the only way back to the States. The main chunk of the story is about the peaceful Klondike town of Dawson being turned upside down by new residents from McIntire's town. Ruth Roman, for instance, who has come with Stewart and his two companions (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, who plays Stewart's best friend), builds a saloon (a Hollywood front for a whorehouse) and tries to run the town's restaurant and hang-out place out of business. She paves the way for McIntire and his goons to come up, too. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the peaks of the Western genre, The Naked Spur. The Far Country is just the tiniest bit less, and it contains 99.9% of what made that film so special without, of course, feeling like a cheap copy. Like The Naked Spur, The Far Country boasts beautiful, on-location cinematography. The landscape is gorgeous. Stewart gives one of his best performances (nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954, Rear Window). I suppose it could be considered cliche, as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end.

It is unbelievable that anyone could survive under such conditions. This is why this movie is so appealing. The fact that this is a true story makes the movie even more interesting and to think that a young girl could survive from this ordeal is overwhelming.

He is joined by a largely unknown but very competent supporting cast, namely his real-life son, Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that every series her hairstyle changes.

{"original_text": "Written and directed by Steve Gordon. Running time: 97 minutes. Classified PG.It was the quintessential comedy of the decade. It won Sir John Gielgud the Academy Award. It was even featured in VH1's \"I Love the 80's.\" And it looks just as good today as it did upon it's initial release. Arthur is the acclaimed comedy classic about a drunken millionaire (played with enthusiasm and wit by Dudley Moore in an Oscar-nominated performance) who must choose between the woman he loves and the life he's grown accustomed to. While the basic plot is one big cliche, there's nothing trite about this congenial combination of clever dialogue and hilarious farce. Arthur Bach is essentially nothing more than a pretentious jerk, but you can't help but like him. Especially when he delivers lines such as, \"Don't you wish you were me?

Classified PG.It was the quintessential comedy of the decade. It won Sir John Gielgud the Academy Award. It was even featured in VH1's \"I Love the 80's.\" And it looks just as good today as it did upon it's initial release. Arthur is the acclaimed comedy classic about a drunken millionaire (played with enthusiasm and wit by Dudley Moore in an Oscar-nominated performance) who must choose between the woman he loves and the life he's grown accustomed to. While the basic plot is one big cliche, there's nothing trite about this congenial combination of clever dialogue and hilarious farce.

Now imagine yourself sharing this gift with the love of your life. What would you do? Would such powers be worth your soul? This is the dilemma presented to Captain Christopher Pike in \"The Cage\" the now-legendary pilot episode of the original Star Trek series. Famously deemed \"too cerebral\" and \"too cold\" by NBC brass and rejected, \"The Cage\" was nevertheless the most ambitious and costly pilot ever made in the history of the network at the time, and Gene Roddenberry did not want to let all that effort and expense go to waste, with the result being this truly classic Star Trek episode, which embeds \"The Cage\" into a frame story which deepens and extends the emotional and philosophical depth of this haunting tale, a landmark in TV history and one of the first truly serious sci-fi stories ever filmed for the small screen...Star Date 3012: The USS Enterprise diverts to Starbase 11 after Mr. Spock receives an urgent message from the former commander of the Enterprise. Surprisingly, the message cannot be from Captain Pike after all, as he is now confined to a wheelchair, mute and horribly disfigured after a tragic accident. Kirk and Starbase commanding officer Commodore Mendez attempt to get to the bottom of the mystery, but before the matter can be cleared up, Spock - for reasons as yet unknown - commits an act of open mutiny, kidnapping the helpless Captain Pike and hijacking the Enterprise via a brilliantly thought-out and timed plan aided by a few Vulcan nerve pinches. Soon, the Enterprise is headed for the remote, forbidden planet of Talos IV. Mendez informs Kirk that Talos IV is under interdiction, and any contact with the planet by Starfleet vessels or personnel carries an immediate death sentence, meaning that Spock appears to be deliberately destroying himself, and Kirk as well, given that the Captain will be held responsible for the ship's activities. Appalled, Kirk and Mendez give chase in a shuttlecraft, which itself becomes dangerous when the Enterprise refuses to answer their calls or pick up the craft until power and oxygen are nearly gone. Spock - knowing that Kirk must be the one following the ship - is of course unable to consign the Captain to certain death. After ordering the craft to be retrieved and the occupants beamed aboard, Spock reveals what he has done to McCoy and demands to be arrested, after having set the starship on an irreversible course to Talos IV. Upon reassuming command, Kirk demands an explanation, whereupon Spock requests immediate court martial by a tribunal of Starfleet commanding officers - of whom there are three on board - Mendez, Kirk, and the crippled invalid Captain Pike. Spock's encyclopedic knowledge of Starfleet regulations enables him to manipulate the tribunal into allowing him to present otherwise inadmissible evidence. Spock presents video recordings of the only contact ever made between the Federation and the inhabitants of Talos IV - a journey taken 13 years earlier by the Enterprise itself under Pike's command. Kirk expresses doubts about the authenticity of the video due to its extreme detail, but the reality of the events depicted is confirmed by Pike himself, who turns out to have been lured to Talos IV by a distress call from the alleged survivors of a Federation research vessel which crashed there 18 years previously. Among the survivors is Vina, a stunning beauty said to have been born just before the disaster. Pike is attracted to the girl and allows her to lure him to an isolated spot, whereupon he is waylaid and captured by the Talosians, a race of androgynous humanoids with enormous cranial capacity and the power to transform thoughts into virtual reality. After Pike's capture, the rest of the \"survivors\" vanish as none of them really existed except Vina. The episode ends when the tribunal learns that Spock's \"evidence\" is in fact being transmitted to the Enterprise directly from Talos IV, in violation of Starfleet regulations.

Tolkien's enchanting world to life once again. Director Peter Jackson weaves an intricate tapestry of magical adventure, breathtaking visuals, and unforgettable characters, delivering a film that both fans and newcomers to the universe of Middle-earth can enjoy.

The reason for my enjoyment is the unique fusion of local flavor, public art, museums, nightlife, and music venues that come together in one extraordinary destination. As I walked through the entrance, I was immediately captivated by the vibrant public art installations that adorned the village. Each piece was a testament to the creativity and innovation of local artists, adding a distinctive flair to the atmosphere. The Museums section of The Music Box Village did not disappoint. I was able to explore various exhibits that showcased the rich history and culture of the local music scene. The interactive displays allowed me to engage with the exhibits in a hands-on way, making for a memorable and educational experience. As the sun began to set, I found myself drawn to the Nightlife and Music Venues. The Music Box Village truly comes alive after dark, with a lively energy that is palpable. I attended a live music performance in one of the venues and was blown away by the talent and passion of the local musicians. The music resonated through the village, creating an infectious energy that had me tapping my feet and dancing along. My time at The Music Box Village was a feast for the senses. The tantalizing aromas of local food vendors wafted through the air, adding to the sensory experience. I sampled a delicious dish from one of the vendors and was delighted by the unique flavors and spices that danced on my tongue. Overall, my experience at The Music Box Village was unlike any other. It is a must-visit destination for anyone with a passion for local flavor, public art, museums, nightlife, and music.

They make them at their other location and bring them over, which is clever, because this location doesn't yet have its liquor license.

The ambiance was warm and inviting, with traditional Korean decor that gave an authentic feel to the restaurant. The staff were friendly and attentive, making us feel welcome from the moment we stepped in. The menu offered a wide variety of Korean dishes that we were excited to try. We started with the Mandu Ppang, which were steamed buns filled with delicious Kabocha pumpkin and pork. They were perfectly cooked and the filling was flavorful and savory. For our main courses, we ordered Bibimbap and Japchae. The Bibimbap was made with a perfect blend of vegetables, beef, and a sunny-side-up egg, served on a sizzling hot stone bowl. The vegetables were crisp and the beef was tender and juicy. The rice at the bottom was perfectly cooked and the entire dish was topped with a spicy gochujang sauce that added just the right amount of heat. The Japchae was another dish that did not disappoint. It was made with sweet potato noodles, beef, vegetables, and soy sauce. The noodles were tender and the beef was cooked to perfection. The vegetables added a nice crunch and the soy sauce gave the dish a savory and umami flavor. To finish off our meal, we had the Hoteok, which were Korean pancakes filled with cinnamon sugar and sliced apples. They were crispy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. The cinnamon sugar and apples added a sweet and delicious touch to the pancakes. Overall, BAP did not disappoint.

{"original_text": "Title: \"The Defiant Ones\" - A Tension-Filled Journey of Survival and Redemption \"The Defiant Ones,\" directed by Stuart Rosenberg, is a gripping and thought-provoking cinematic experience that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats. The film tells the story of two men, John J. 'Johnny' Clay (Sidney Poitier) and Ernest 'Ernie' Bass (Tony Curtis), who escape from a Southern jail and must navigate their way to freedom in the desolate and unforgiving terrain of post-World War II America. Poitier and Curtis deliver captivating performances as two polar opposites, bringing depth and complexity to their characters. Their contrasting demeanor and motivations create an intense and palpable tension that keeps the audience engaged throughout the film. The cinematography is stunning, showcasing the raw and untamed beauty of the American Southwest, while also highlighting the harsh and unforgiving conditions that the two men must endure. Every scene is meticulously crafted to build upon the previous one, adding layers to the narrative and keeping the audience hooked. The film also tackles themes of race, class, and societal norms, showcasing the prejudices and injustices that were prevalent during the era. However, it does so in a subtler and more nuanced way, allowing the story and characters to take center stage. \"The Defiant Ones\" is a masterclass in filmmaking, with its expertly crafted narrative, stunning cinematography, and powerful performances. It is a must-watch for fans of the genre and for anybody looking for a thought-provoking and engaging cinematic experience.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "\"The Defiant Ones\" is one of the most iconic films in the history of the independent film genre, and it remains one of my all-time favourite films to this day, despite the fact that I have seen it only once in the last 25 years or so, when I saw it at the Venice Film Festival in 1988.\" \"TheDefiantOnes\" has been described as \"one of the greatest independent films of all time,\" and it is a testament to the quality and craftsmanship of the film's makers that it is able to stand the test of time and continue to captivate audiences for more than 70 years after it was first released in the 1960s.

{"original_text": "\"This Man's Navy\" is, as other comments have indicated, a rare and well-filmed look at Navy lighter than air (LTA) activities. The LTA crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack. And the filming at the various NAS locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone. However, the first half of the movie is all about Beery, his relationship with his service pals, and him meeting the Tom Drake character and his mother, and getting Drake's leg fixed. Only then does the second film start. The second film is mostly LTAs in action, taking on a surfaced sub, guys get killed and much damage is caused. The look is fairly gritty and realistic, I imagine. Then we shift to Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have LTAs there? Never mind, this part is really wild, with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle. And the Japs are shooting like mad.

I knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where I am currently residing.

{"original_text": "First off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that I hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as being so stupid that you wounder if they're all the result of inbreeding.Now I will say this I did see the first three American Pie movies and while they weren't the most amazing movies that I'd ever seen they were all right (and outright masterpieces compared to the three \"American Pie Presents\" films), I still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie?I also have a few other questions too.Who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources? who approved the final script (and what was that person smoking when they approved it)? And lastly why did anyone think that it deserved to be released into theaters where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you live when it should have gone straight to the discount bin at Blockbuster or Wal Mart?There is so much wrong with this movie that I can't write a really comprehensive review of it because it would exceed the maximum allowed words on this forum so I'll just touch on the biggest things wrong with it.The plot is generic uninspired and stupid and characters are all about as interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minutes but the biggest thing that I can see wrong with this movie is the acting.While most of the cast are talentless no namers who will probably be forgotten in a few years,the one and only big name in this movie is Eugene Levy who spends almost all of the time he is on screen with this knowing smirk on his face that says to the viewer \"I know this isn't funny and I'm wasting my talents but hey I'm getting payed for it so who cares\" he doesn't even try to make any of his jokes funny (he really deserves better than this garbage). As I mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are horrible even though some of them have been in some really great TV shows, Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back) plays a character who is so unbearable unlikeable and irritating (there are things that he could teach to tropical skin diseases)that you almost wish he'd die a slow and painful death on screen, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) just hangs around on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this film.Maybe the next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line so they can get around the MPAA and get an R rating this movie goes all out with pointless nudity vulgarity and pointlessly offencive sexual content that it should have gotten the X rating (the ratings board must have been drunk or on drugs when they reviewed this film for its rating). It's interesting that twenty five years ago when Wes Craven submitted A Nightmare On Elm Street to the MPAA for a rating review they forced him to cut twenty five seconds of footage (I believe that it was part of a death scene that had a silicone casting of a breast in it) to avoid getting an X rating and he had no other choice but to do it or the film wouldn't have been released, but this kind of needlessly offensive trash can get the R rating today because it's all done in the name of comedy, if this movie was a drama or horror film with this kind of content there would have been a huge stink over the content and it would havegotten the dreaded X rating.The last thing that really annoys me is the writing, this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old kid with an extremely overactive sexual imagination its quite juvenile and extraordinarily crass, nearly every expository situation that is supposed to move the corpse that this movie calls a plot along is so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and and the so called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes, never mind the often repulsive sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior it feels like this film was written by some incompetent first year hack in a low rent film school script writing class.the long and short of it is its time to kill this series before it gets any stupider more crass and offensive, this pie is filled with road apples.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "First off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that I hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as being so stupid that you wounder if they're all the result of inbreeding.Now I will say this I did see the first three American Pie movies and while they weren't the most amazing movies that I'd ever seen they were all right (and outright masterpieces compared to the three \"American Pie Presents\" films), I still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie?I also have a few other questions too.Who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources? who approved the final script (and what was that person smoking when they approved it)?

{"original_text": "Understand first that this was a party trip with some buddies so I am reviewing the hotel a little differently than I might have if I was with the family. If you can, get a room with a patio overlooking Bourbon St, just part of the experience. Room was clean, maybe a little small but it didn't matter because we spent very little time in the room. The hotel is centrally located, has a great bar/lounge with live music and is connected to Desire restaurant which is very solid. If your room is on Bourbon, it can be pretty loud but with enough libations, falling asleep was never an issue.

If you can, get a room with a patio overlooking Bourbon St, just part of the experience. Room was clean, maybe a little small but it didn't matter because we spent very little time in the room. The hotel is centrally located, has a great bar/lounge with live music and is connected to Desire restaurant which is very solid. If your room is on Bourbon, it can be pretty loud but with enough libations, falling asleep was never an issue.

{"original_text": "I just went to Village Tap Room and I must say, it was an enjoyable experience. The reason for my satisfaction is the establishment's fantastic blend of a gastropub, cocktail bar, beer bar, and restaurant all under one roof. Upon entering, the inviting atmosphere instantly drew me in, with its cozy interior and lively nightlife vibe. The food was exceptional, showcasing locally sourced ingredients and creative twists on classic dishes. The beer selection was impressive, with an extensive range of local, domestic, and international brews on tap and in bottles. I was particularly impressed by the knowledgeable and friendly bartender, who made an excellent cocktail recommendation based on my preferences. The service was attentive, yet unobtrusive, and thestaff were helpful and welcoming. The crowd was a great mix of locals and tourists, adding to the lively and inclusive atmosphere. Overall, Village Tap Room is a must-visit for anyone seeking a great dining experience, a unique cocktail, or a fantastic selection of beer in a welcoming and friendly environment.

The Bulgogi Tacos were a revelation, with the tender, marinated beef balancing perfectly with the cool, freshness of the cabbage slaw. The pricing was reasonable, and the portions were generous.

One is considered one of the great romantic films of all time, and the movie that made Olivier a great movie star (and gave Oberon her best performance role): WUTHERING HEIGHTS. The other is this film, made in England a year earlier. THE DIVORCE OF LADY X is a romantic comedy (as WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a romantic tragedy). Olivier is a lawyer, Everard Logan, who is a dynamic barrister, but is also a total misogynist. One night he checks into a hotel just ahead of a crowd of people. It is a very foggy night (the type of pea soup fog that London was known for up until a notorious \"killer\" fog in the 1950s), and the crowd (who'd been attending a party in the hotel) need beds. The management tries to get Logan to allow one or two socialite ladies to sleep on a couch and a day bed in his rooms, but he refuses. But he has not reckoned with Merle Oberon as Leslie Steele. The granddaughter of a high court judge, she manages to get into Logan's rooms and manipulates him to not only agree to her sleeping there, but appropriates his bed (he goes onto the couch - much to his discomfort).The next day they share a breakfast, and in the smalltalk it is evident that despite his mistrust of women Logan finds Leslie very attractive. But she kittenishly refuses to tell him her name. She is determined to learn more about him, and she finds his attitude toward women infuriating. In the meantime, Logan is approached by a wealthy nobleman (Ralph Richardson as Lord Mere) as a potential client. Mere suspects his wife Lady Mere (Binnie Barnes) of having an affair. In fact, he tells Logan her Ladyship was with her lover in the hotel that Logan knows he was in on the night of the fog. Logan (naturally) jumps to the conclusion that Lady Mere was his mysterious roommate that night. I will not go into the plot any further, except to say that Leslie eventually realizes what a mistake Logan has made, and decides to use it to teach him a lesson about women.The script has the feel of a Wodehouse novel, but is slighter. Still the performances of Olivier, Oberon, Richardson, Barnes, and Morton Selden (as Oberon's grandfather) are all splendid. It shows what a good cast can do with even the slightest of materials. Take a look at some of the minor scenes to see what I mean: Selden's first scene, complaining about his weak coffee to his butler/valet, who tells him off properly (they've been used to each other's personalities for years).

{"original_text": "I know that there are some purists out there who poo poo anything that is not exactly like the original, however sometimes spin-offs can stand on their own merits. I like the new Iron Chef because it is similar enough to the Japanese version but at the same time caters to American spirit. I love Alton Brown as commentator, because he explains things with flair. The Iron Chefs themselves are very interesting. I know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time, but Bobby Flay is the only American Iron Chef to beat them. Mario Batali seems to have the most fun when cooking, making comments and being flashy while creating. I have watched the series and find all the players work together well. The judges are not always the best choices, however. There are a few exceptions, like the lawyer turned foodie, but most of the judges are questionable in being able to handle what is served.

I like the new Iron Chef because it is similar enough to the Japanese version but at the same time caters to American spirit. I love Alton Brown as commentator, because he explains things with flair. The Iron Chefs themselves are very interesting. I know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time, but Bobby Flay is the only American Iron Chef to beat them. Mario Batali seems to have the most fun when cooking, making comments and being flashy while creating. I have watched the series and find all the players work together well. The judges are not always the best choices, however. There are a few exceptions, like the lawyer turned foodie, but most of the judges are questionable in being able to handle what is served.

{"original_text": "Peter Bogdonavich has made a handful of truly great films, and THEY ALL LAUGHED is one of his best. The cast couldn't be better equipped to play this light but slightly bittersweet screwball comedy. Interestingly enough, the witty, light touch Bogdonavich so effortlessly employs gives the film a rather disarming emotional core. Fresh and immediate, the film starts with absolutely no explanation. There's no soundtrack music to cue us. We meet the characters in action, and as Bogdonavich glides down the streets of New York, the film unfolds effortlessly. Robby Muller's camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental, but surely isn't. The cast is terrific.

{"original_text": "Casting unknown Michelle Rodriguez as Diana was a stroke of genius. She's perfect. Her acting inexperience actually works in her favor. We've never seen her before so it really feels like her story. She also brings across genuine toughness. This works against her though, because we never doubt her. You never have to cheer for her to win because she never goes up against any fighter we don't think she can beat. So as a boxing movie, it fails.Then again, this isn't really a boxing movie. How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer that isn't a boxing movie? You don't. But Karyn Kusama has anyway. Like many indie films, \"Girlfight\" defies classification or genre and stands on its own as folklore that could darn near happen in real life.Diana is doing poorly in school. She beats up people she doesn't like (all the other girls in her school for example). She doesn't fit in. Her father is forcing her kid brother Tiny to learn to box so he can defend himself when things get tough. He gives Tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives Diana nothing, as if she has no need to defend herself, nor anything worthwhile to make of her life. Tiny wants to go to art school (cliche', yuck), so he gives up his boxing allowance to Diana, who actually wants to box. Things get complicated when Diana falls for another boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who's looking to turn pro. From there the story winds down toward the inevitable...the two meet in the amateur title fight.What left me cold was that I never found any of this all that interesting. It's all just a bit too believable. Kids with tough lives growing up in rough urban areas fall back on sports. A lot of professional boxers have risen from these circumstances. The mental and physical toughness this upbringing requires lends itself to a game like boxing, where anger is your friend. So this time it's a girl. Big deal.Or there's another position to take: finally, a boxing movie about a girl. Women's boxing has been around a long time. The brutality we usually see in boxing films is replaced here by discussions of people's their lives and their feelings. The whole fighting thing is used as a platform from which to paint a larger picture. Respect. Overcoming adversity.

I kept the slip and cashed out on my way out and the lady working the cashier's desk asked if I was serious about wanting this paltry sum.

And boobies are always a plus altho the movie for some strange reason doesn't play with that card very much even tho the plot line introduces two black haired women who act as the evil counter part of our two blondes.So all in all, a good movie to watch.

Furthermore, the bar area was crowded and chaotic, making it difficult to order a drink or find a comfortable place to sit.

I usually go with a Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate or Mocha. I also occasionally order the White Mocha. If you can't tell, I enjoy coffee that doesn't taste like coffee! In the summer their iced teas are the perfect thirst quencher! Their breakfast pastry items are always delicious. Try the Cranberry-Orange Scone and you will not be disappointed! Their breakfast sandwiches are unique and pretty tasty as well. I always choose to go in and place my order over sitting in the drive thru. The line for their drive thru is always ridiculously long.

{"original_text": "I just got the UK 4-disc special edition of Superman 1 for about $5. The additional stuff includes the 1951 feature Superman and the Mole-Men. So I slapped it into the DVD player last night, and here are my findings.Some initial disappointment - I hadn't checked, and I think I had it mentally tagged as one of the Kirk Alyn serials. I'm not a huge fan of George Reeves as Superman, and I hadn't seen anything other than the odd clip of Kirk Alyn - but hey ho, never mind.This black and white production runs for less than an hour. It has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of Reeves' early TV series, a two-parter, put together for cinema release, although IMDb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first TV series. In any event, it's an odd choice for reasons I'll get to later. I'm of an age where I recall TV and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets, so there were no major surprises here. Even so, for a low budget movie, this one is REALLY low budget.The story concerns the small town of Silsby - population 1,430 - which, puzzlingly, is also home to the world's deepest oil well (6 miles). The story opens with the well's foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down. This conflicts with the arrival of Metropolis reporters Kent and Lane to report on the well, at the behest of the oil company. As Clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down, a couple of odd little guys (small in stature, big in head, black in jumpsuit, and bushy in eyebrow) emerge from the capped-off drillshaft, and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces.A deep breath now, here is the remaining plot of the picture. The little guys scare some kids, so Jeff Corey (playing the town's rampant xenophobe) incites some pals to kill these \"creatures\". Superman steps in (moderately ineffectually) and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital. Corey's pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed, but he escapes and legs it down the shaft. Corey incites a lynch mob (despite the sheriff arresting him) to hang the hospitalised Mole-Man. Superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows. A total of 4 Mole-Men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at Jeff Corey (I call this an Aargh! gun because its sole effect seems to be to make Corey go \"Aargh!\") and Superman saves him. He immediately changes his ways because of amazement at Superman saving him after the way he has behaved, the Mole-men go back down the shaft. The end.Despite the film only being an hour long, there is an inordinate amount of creeping around, bewareing and pursuing - I have left out all the \"Mole-Man 1 creeps from A to B, looking out to make sure no-one is following him\" stuff. The Mole-Men are never engaged in any way whatsoever - they have no dialogue - they just turn up, get persecuted, and go back. They do look a little creepy, but they are hardly the bug-eyed monsters that the town's reaction implies.Reeves is quite a good Clark Kent - very much a hard-nosed reporter, much more so than Phyllis Coates' rather indifferent Lois Lane. But he is a terrible, terrible Superman. Not only does he not look the part (at least his hair is dyed black in this, which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the TV episodes), the way he plays it is all wrong in my book. I'm sure he was told to \"strike the pose\" (which Superman does constantly), but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips, not fists on ribs. And he plays Superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher - he doesn't actually wag his finger in remonstration, but he may as well have done.And Superman does a huge amount of walking around (I say a huge amount - he isn't actually in it all that much), and a bit of running. He takes off and lands a couple of times, but isn't seen in flight at any point. Oh, some bullets bounce off him, and he uses telescopic vision as Clark, but with no accompanying visual effect. In fact, visual effects are conspicuous by their absence, and the few which are present aren't very good.I've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time: but even by those standards I think it's a pretty threadbare effort. Thankfully, production standards on the TV series were higher, and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them.Something of a disappointment - I shan't be watching it again.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I just got the UK 4-disc special edition of Superman 1 for about $5.

{"original_text": "Remember the good ol' animated batman show from the 90's? The one that people praised? The one that people of all ages could all appreciate? The one that showed batman as a real detective instead of the Hulk in a bat suit? The one that had villains you could relate to? The one that had villains with real motives?Well clearly, Warner Bros. doesn't. Hence this dreck.Honestly, do these people know anything about batman? Have they even looked at a batman comic before? Do they know Batman's meant to be a'detective'? Putting together 2 clues does not make you a detective! That makes you a slightly intelligent monkey!This is the basic layout for an episode:Penguin steals something.'Opening credits'. Batman finds dead giveaway of where he is. Batman goes there and get's into trouble. Commercial. Batman finds obvious/ stupid way out of it. Penguin escapes. Penguin does something obvious again. Batman follows.

He then continues to steal jewels for no reason, while saying sh!t lines like \"Have an ice day\".Maybe they did watch Batman &Robin after all.But hey, look on the bright side.

There's a pretty risqu\u00e9 amount of female nudity on display, for those who like that kind of thing (but obviously nothing hardcore).Most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential; the girls are stereotypes, and German Anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder - she's a moron obsessed with colour TV who acts like a kind of uninhibited child & dresses to deliberately show her private parts; in another more serious film, she would be a psychiatric case. The most interesting section of the film involves the Swedish girl being taken to a club in London where some dodgy types are still trying to swing, being seduced by a middle-aged rocker, losing her virginity and realising that the scene is not for her.

I agree that it's an engaging and thought-provoking movie, with its unique blend of science, suspense, and human drama. Despite its many merits, there are certain aspects of the film that I feel could have been executed more effectively. For instance, some of the special effects, particularly the depiction of the Andromeda virus, look a bit dated today. Additionally, some of the character development could have been more nuanced, as some of the characters feel like archetypes rather than fully realized individuals. All in all, however, \"The Andromeda Strain\" remains an entertaining and thought-provoking film that is worth watching, especially for fans of science fiction and suspense. It raises some interesting questions about the nature of life, the role of science in society, and the potential dangers of unchecked technological progress. And with its excellent cast, including Arthur Hill, David Wayne, and James Olson, it's a movie that is easy to get invested in. If you're a fan of \"The Andromeda Strain,\" I would also recommend checking out the source material, a novel by Michael Crichton that the film was based on. The novel goes into much greater depth on the scientific aspects of the Andromeda virus and provides a more comprehensive exploration of its implications.

It seems that there are legends in that area of a beast that was rather, uh, frisky, I guess you could say, with the ladies, or at least, one in particular. There are all kinds of references tucked away in that regard but every time the soon-to-be-blushing young bride gets her curious little hands on one the groom's father removes it from her sight. Anyway, the young bride-to-be goes upstairs to sleep while the family is waiting for a Cardinal to show up to the wedding (a family member, I guess) and as she dreams she dreams of a beast in the woods that has its way with her. The effects in this leave a little to be desired, and any attempt at eroticism (not that I know much about that) is kind of rendered laughable, especially when certain featured appendages appear about as realistic as a bed post or a baseball bat.

This unsung slasher classic is a delightful morsel for fans of the genre. Our tale opens on the idyllic summer camp, Tower Camp, where we meet the unsuspecting, yet likeable, teens. The prank that goes awry on head caretaker Cropsy sets off a chain reaction of events, leaving us on the edge of our seats, clutching pillows a little tighter. The cinematography is a beautifully composed feast for the eyes - with every frame exuding the oppressive summer heat, providing a perfect backdrop to the impending terror. The soundscape is another testament to The Burning's mastery. The tension builds with each menacing crackle and snap, leaving us utterly transfixed. The performances are uniformly strong. Bob Elliott's portrayal of the terrifying Cropsy is both chilling and mesmerizing. The unsuspecting teens, played by an ensemble cast, provide just the right balance of naivety and bravery, ensuring we're invested in their survival. The Burning revels in the splatter and gore that fans of the genre crave, but it's the suspenseful build-up and the unexpected twists that truly set this film apart.

It's a very cool, very like-minded crowd. Food wise you can't go wrong with duck fat french fries. I feel like I don't even need to say that, because come on.... duck. fat. french. fries. We also go for the cheese puffs on their late night menu as well: a hot pan of ping-pong ball sized bread balls coated in cheese and broiled and delicious and.... oh boy now I'm, hungry. And if the other reviews aren't clear enough.... their burgers will have you singing hymns of praise to the meat gods."}

He looked like an overweight teenager dressed up for Halloween, complete with the $4.95 stick-on beard.The special effects were so-so, though the \"undead\" in the cellar were pretty good. The tree-tongue looked like something from a bad 1950s monster flick, though the POV shots from the tongue's view more closely resembled Sam Raimi's trademark shots in the more recent \"Evil Dead\" trilogy. The pyrotechnics were ho-hum and the final battle is about as dull as you can get. (In fact, it most closely reminded me of the \"Lost in Space\" episode where the Robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and....) The plot was not particularly original and has been told countless times in the form of European fairy tales. There was no suspense and no plot twists.

{"original_text": "In \"The Spy Who Came In from the Cold,\" John le Carr\u00e9 weaves a dense and intricately plotted tale of espionage and betrayal that leaves readers both captivated and disoriented. The novel follows Alec Leamas, a veteran British intelligence officer, as he embarks on one final mission: to penetrate the East German intelligence service and secure a precious piece of intelligence. Le Carr\u00e9 expertly navigates the shifting allegiances and moral complexities of the Cold War era, deftly exploring themes of loyalty, deception, and the cost of human life in the pursuit of national security. The narrative is a labyrinthine maze of double-crosses and clandestine encounters, and Le Carr\u00e9's nuanced character development infuses each twist and turn with both tension and emotional depth. Leamas is a consummate professional, a man willing to sacrifice everything for the greater good. But as the line between friends and enemies blurs, and the stakes grow ever higher, it becomes increasingly unclear whose side he is truly on. Le Carr\u00e9 masterfully explores the blurred lines of allegiance, and the resulting emotional turmoil propels the reader forward. Moreover, Le Carr\u00e9's prose is elegant, evocative, and precise, rendering each scene with breathtaking clarity and detail.

He immediately recognized me as a new customer and told me all about the fresh ingredients he uses. Chicken is cooked over coal and was tender on the inside and perfectly cooked on the outside. Falafel was delicious, as were the grapes and his homemade pasta that went along with it. There was enough food for 2 people. Well worth the wait!"}

{"original_text": "Title: Flight of the Navigator - A Heartwarming and Adventurous Ride for All Ages \"Flight of the Navigator,\" released in 1986, is an underappreciated gem of a sci-fi family adventure film that continues to capture the imaginations of viewers young and old. The story follows 12-year-old David Freeman, who mysteriously disappears during a summer night in 1978 and wakes up eight years later to find that not only has time passed, but so have his parents, who are now aging and expecting a different child from him. The strange occurrences don't end there, as David soon encounters an alien spacecraft, which he affectionately names MAX, and embarks on an interstellar journey to find his way home. In the hands of the talented cast and crew, \"Flight of the Navigator\" masterfully balances science fiction, humor, and heart. The visual effects, while not necessarily groundbreaking, hold up remarkably well even today. The performances of the lead actors David Hessler as David and Sarah Jessica Parker as Helen are also noteworthy, adding depth to their characters and making you genuinely care for their experiences. Additionally, the film's themes of growing up, responsibility, and the importance of family remain just as resonant today as they were over three decades ago. Overall, \"Flight of the Navigator\" is a charming and adventurous film that offers a timeless, heartwarming journey for viewers of all ages. Its unique premise, strong performances, and beautiful blend of science fiction and family values make it a must-watch for fans of the genre or anyone looking for a wholesome and entertaining experience.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "As part of the 30th anniversary of the release of the film \"Back to the Future\" on Blu-ray, the makers of \"Flight of the Navigator\" have re-released the film on DVD for the first time since its original release in 1986 to celebrate the film's 30th birthday.'' the film is available now on DVD and Blu-Ray for the suggested retail price of $28.98, or $22.98 for a digital copy on Amazon.com, iTunes, and other digital retailers.'

{"original_text": "Lee Chang-dong's exceptional \"Secret Sunshine\" is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year. It is an instantly sobering, brutally honest character piece on the reverberations of loss and a graceful memento mori that resonates with a striking density of thought, yet remains as inscrutable as the emotions it observes. Through its layered naturalism and stunningly trenchant view of small-town dynamics, Lee implicitly deconstructs the traditional Korean melodrama by pulling apart the cinematics of excess and ripping to shreds the arcs that shape its characters and grounds the proceedings into a crushing grind of stoic realism.\"Secret Sunshine\" remains an immensely compelling, fluid work throughout its 142-minute runtime. Its bravura first hour is filled to the brim with subtextual insinuations, remarkable foreshadowing and adroit reversals of tone brought about by humanistic capriciousness. Adapted from a short story, Lee infuses the film with his sensitivity for the sublime paradoxes of life, last seen in his transgressively comic and irreverent \"Oasis\". Understanding how personal revolutions are forged when views of our universe are changed, Lee not only sees the emotional cataclysm of a widow's sorrow through an inquiring scope but also feels the tumultuous existential currents that underpin the film when religion becomes a narrative scapegoat in comprehending the heinousness of the human experience.Do-yeon Jeon's (\"You Are My Sunshine\") Best Actress accolade at Cannes in 2007 is well deserved. Her performance as the widow Shin-ae remains an unrelenting enigma. As a character pulled apart by forces beyond her control, the sheer magnificence of this performance is central to the film's turbulent nature. With Jeon essaying one cyclonic upheaval after another, there's a tremulous sense of collapse that the film, to its credit, never approaches. Instead it finds a delicate balance that saps the charged theatricality and subsequent banality from ordinary tragedies and its fallouts. She becomes the centre of the film's universe as well as ours. Filmed in glorious hand-held CinemaScope, the film demolishes the cinematicism of frames and compositions by becoming visually acute just as it is quietly harrowing when the camera never relinquishes its gaze from Shin-ae through times of happiness, guilt and remorse.Lee captures the details of life in the small, suspicious town of Miryang \u0096 the awkwardness of communal situations, its uncomfortable silences and its devastations spun out of personal dramas. Shin-ae's interactions with the townsfolk rarely inspires dividends, especially when they are merely done out of obligation to fit in for the sake of her son, Jun (Seon Jung-yeop). The one recurring acquaintance is Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho), a bachelor mechanic of uncertain intentions who helps her en route to Miryang in the film's enchanting open sequence set to a captivating stream of sunlight. Song has situated himself as a comedic anti-hero in South Korea's biggest films but his nuanced, low-key delivery here purports the director's thought process of never having to reveal more than plainly necessary.If pain is ephemeral, then grief can never truly dissipate. And Lee finds complexity in subsistence. When Shin-ae attempts to head down the path of reconciliation only to be faced again with unimaginable heartbreak, she unsuccessfully employs the fellowship of evangelical Christianity as a foil to her sorrow. But Lee knows better than that when he understands that religion, in the context of the human canvas of strife and misery, is never a simple solution. But Lee never rebukes the essence of religion as he realises the value of salvation for some through a higher power even if it serves a form of denial in others. The scenes in its latter half which deal with religion doesn't allow itself to become aggressively scornful, which is a feat in itself considering how many filmmakers let the momentum of the material take over from what they need to say to be true to its story and characters.Lee's first film since his call to office as his country's Minister of Culture and Tourism is an uncompromising dissertation on human suffering. In a film so artless and genuine, it arduously reveals that there's nothing as simple as emotional catharsis, just the suppression and abatement of agony. \"Secret Sunshine\" leaves us with tender mercies pulled out of evanescence, and points towards a profound understanding of despair and faith.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Lee Chang-dong's exceptional \"Secret Sunshine\" is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year.

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America.

{"original_text": "Well! What can one say? Firstly, this adaptation is far too long at 4 hours, for the complexity (or lack of such) of the plot. The actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available. Swayzee is really NOT a Quatermain character at all. After seeing Sean Connery's interpretation of the great man in \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\", Swayzee really does not make the grade. This chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength, stature, subtlety, or humour needed for the part, and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor, who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast. Some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography. For example. When the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert, their tracks are visible down to the oasis, just waiting for them to walk in them. Climbing out of the mine leads to an exit (on the next shot) nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through, et cetera. I was waiting for Doug McClure to appear at any moment. In some ways I wish he had. The leader of the Russians pursuing Quatermain is a shoddily created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything. Swayzee does quite well as the sad father, returned to London, who is unable to obtain the custody of his son. Swayzee should stick to that sort of thing. He is not able to carry the part of a courageous gentleman with a stout heart, experience of life, and sense of fair play.4 out of 10.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Well! What can one say?

Although Disney adapts the story somewhat liberally, you gather the idea of the era via the dress and set stylizations---a clear time period the story takes place.Cinderella is more mature than Snow White, and a multi-dimensional character. Actually, all of the characters are somewhat well-developed, except for the Prince--left the most flat--we know he has a sense of humor, and a great smile, but that's about all.

The waiting room is dimly lit and their is soft music playing throughout. I think they accidentally double booked Ashley, as I waited 15-20 minutes, which wasn't that big a deal (in my opinion). Ashley met me and brought me into the treatment room, where she also had music playing. She asked me what I was looking for and walked me through the process. She got to work right away and even asked if the temperature of the wax was OK. She also filled my brows in with a pencil before letting me see the finished look. I am very happy with my brows. She listened when I said I didn't want them too thin and she didn't try to change my look. I will definitely be returning in 5 weeks and will recommend to friends in the area."}

{"original_text": "This remarkable film can be summed up very easily. First of all, while the comparisons to \"Princess Bride\" are inevitable, it's almost futile to do so. While both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop, \"Stardust\" is so much different than any other fantasy/sci-fi film I've ever seen. It's such a hybrid of those genres, but its plot and script are so unique that--along with the performances, special effects, cinematography, and score--the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen. Secondly, the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along, while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist. Thirdly, I did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way. In fact, the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch. Wonderfully casted, and superbly acted across the board. This fantasy adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best one I've seen since \"Return of the King\" (not that I am comparing the two at all). OK, so its not that easy to sum up, but don't let any crude and/or heartless and cynical review nor the film's pathetic PR prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer (or even possibly in a long time)!", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This remarkable film can be summed up very easily.

The plot wasn't engaging: If you found the storyline dull or predictable, this could have contributed to your feeling that the movie was just OK. 2. The characters weren't well-developed: If you didn't connect with any of the characters or felt that their motivations weren't clear, this could have made it harder for you to invest in the story. 3.

The action sequences are also quite thrilling. 2. \"Minority Report\" (2002) - Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film is set in a future where crimes can be predicted and prevented before they occur. The visual effects are impressive, and the ethical questions it raises are thought-provoking. 3. \"Ex Machina\" (2014) - This is a more recent sci-fi film that focuses on artificial intelligence and human emotion. It's a smaller-scale film, but it's very thought-provoking and well-acted. 4. \"Her\" (2013) - This film explores the idea of falling in love with an artificial intelligence, which is a unique take on the genre. It's a quieter, more introspective film that's both touching and thought-provoking. 5. \"Arrival\" (2016) - This film is a little more mysterious and ambiguous than some of the others, but it's a fascinating exploration of time and language.

{"original_text": "Why did I go to see this film?

{"original_text": "George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" is a classic novel that explores important themes of politics, power, and morality. However, I understand that the 1954 film adaptation of the story may not live up to everyone's expectations. Here are a few possible thoughts as to why one might find the film mediocre: 1. Simplification of complex themes: \"Animal Farm\" is a complex novel that contains multi-layered meanings. The film adaptation may not do justice to the nuances and complexities of the original story. For instance, some of the allegorical nuances may be lost in translation from the page to the screen. 2. Animation: The use of animation may not appeal to everyone. While the animation can be effective in bringing the animal characters to life, it can also make the film feel dated and less engaging compared to live-action films. 3. Sluggish pacing: The film may move too slowly for some viewers. The novel's explorations of political theories and moral dilemmas can be complex and dense, and the film may not be able to convey this complexity in an engaging way. 4. Lack of emotional resonance: The animals in the story are anthropomorphic, which means they have human-like qualities. However, the film may not fully capture the emotional resonance of the characters. For instance, the audience may not feel a strong connection to the animals or their struggles. 5. Limited production values: The production values of the 1954 film may be limited compared to modern filmmaking techniques. For example, the special effects and animation may not look as sophisticated as what is available today. This can make the film feel less immersive and less engaging. Despite these potential weaknesses, \"Animal Farm\" is still an important and influential work of literature and animation. It continues to be studied and appreciated for its political commentary and exploration of universal themes.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "The film adaptation of George Orwell's classic novel \"Animal Farm\" has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike, with some saying that the film does not do justice to the novel's complex themes and others saying that it does not capture the emotional resonance of the animals in the story, writes the BBC's Geeta Pandey in an article for the BBC World News website on Wednesday, 28 March. The novel\"s explorations of political theories and moral dilemmas can be complex and dense, and the film may not be able to convey this complexity in an engaging way, says Geeta Pandey, a film and television student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) who is studying the novel \" Animal Farm\" for her master's degree in film, television, and digital media at the School of Visual and Performing Arts (SVPA) in Los Angeles, in an interview with the BBC on Tuesday, 27 March."}

In Dr. Strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation, and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments. Slow-burning madness and attempting to kill one's family isn't hilarious of course, but the dialogue is very knowing (\"five months of peace is just what I want.... \") and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit, but is spine-chilling when you factor in the other.I disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on Jack Torrance in the filmed version. The cues Nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness, which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son. The environment that he is in, however, then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness. In much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there, the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man, and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return. He may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives, but to me the Overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off.Kubrick's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film, and the unpredictable force of nature that is Jack Nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you.

In much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there, the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man, and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return. He may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives, but to me the Overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off.Kubrick's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film, and the unpredictable force of nature that is Jack Nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you. When he explodes, you won't be sure how far he can go. Together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic. If you want a great viewing experience, then this is an example that well and truly shines..."}

{"original_text": "Title: Prince of Darkness (1987) - A Creepy and Thought-Provoking Horror Tale \"Prince of Darkness,\" directed by John Carpenter, is a chilling and thought-provoking horror film that leaves the audience on the edge of their seats, pondering deep philosophical questions long after the credits roll. The story revolves around a group of researchers who uncover an ancient canister in a deserted church. They soon discover it contains a green, oozing liquid and a mysterious figure dressed in a priest's robe. As the substance begins to take over their lives, they realize they have awakened the Antichrist himself. It's a classic fight-for-survival story, with plenty of jump scares and moments of tension to keep things interesting. However, what sets \"Prince of Darkness\" apart from other horror films of the era is its exploration of profound and thought-provoking themes. Carpenter manages to merge science and spirituality in a way that will leave you pondering the meaning of existence long after the film is over. The performances are solid across the board, with special mention to Donald Pleasence, who delivers yet another captivating turn as a man of science grappling with supernatural forces. The film's dark, ominous atmosphere is sustained throughout, thanks to some effective production design and beautiful, haunting cinematography. The special effects, although somewhat dated today, hold up surprisingly well and still have the power to send shivers down the spine. In conclusion, \"Prince of Darkness\" is a must-watch for horror fans and anyone looking for a thought-provoking cinematic experience. It may not be for the faint-hearted, but those who appreciate a good scare with a side of intellectual curiosity will not be disappointed.\"", "label": 0, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Title: Prince of Darkness (1987) - A Creepy and Thought-Provoking Horror Tale \"Prince of Darkness,\" directed by John Carpenter, is a chilling and thought-provoking horror film that leaves the audience on the edge of their seats, pondering deep philosophical questions long after the credits roll.

{"original_text": "To bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as Braveheart. Though it is a very different kind of film, the conflict between Scottish commoners and English nobility is front and center here as well. Roughly 400 years had passed between the time Braveheart took place and Rob Roy was set, but some things never seemed to change. Scottland is still run by English nobles, and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them. Rob Roy is handsomely done, but not the grand epic that Braveheart was. There are no large-scale battles, and the conflict here is more between individuals. And helpfully so not all Englishmen are portrayed as evil this time. Rob Roy is simply a film about those with honor, and those who are truly evil.Liam Neeson plays the title character Rob Roy MacGregor. He is the leader of the MacGregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the Marquis of Montrose (John Hurt). Things look pretty rough for the MacGregor clan as winter is approaching, and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone. Rob Roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the Marquis and purchase some cattle of his own. He would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community. Sounds fair enough, doesn't it? Problems arise when two cronies of the Marquis steal the money for themselves. One of them, known as Archibald Cunningham, is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film. Played wonderfully by Tim Roth, this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the Marquis by his mother. This man is disgustingly effeminate, rude, heartless, and very dangerous with a sword. He fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility. He rapes Macgregor's wife and burns him out of his home. This guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come. Along with another crony of the Marquis (Brian Cox) Cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts. Though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened, the Marquis still holds MacGregor to the debt. This sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity.Spoilers ahead!!!!!Luckily for the MacGregor's, a Duke who is no friend to the Marquis sets up a final duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all. This sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed. Cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace. And for most of the fight, it looks like these attributes will win out. Just when it looks like Rob Roy is finished, he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner. The first time you see what happens, you will probably be as shocked as Cunningham! Rob Roy is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and perfectly paced. The score is quite memorable, too. The casting choices seem to have worked out as Jessica Lange, who might seem to be out of her element, actually turns in one of the strongest performances as Mary MacGregor. The film is violent, but there isn't too much gore. It is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior, however. The nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy.

{"original_text": "Since starting to read the book this movie is based on, I'm having mixed feelings about the filmed result. I learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before I read the book, because I found that if I read the book first I was inevitably disappointed in the film. This would undoubtedly have been true here, whereas in the case of Atonement, which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book I've ever seen, it would probably not have mattered.I'm trying to figure out what the cause is, and I suspect that I have to point my finger squarely at Michael Cunningham. Much as I respect him for The Hours (which I have not read but which I saw and was awed by) I cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted Susan Minton's book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it.It's not that I dislike the movie. I actually love the movie, which is why, since I started reading the novel, I'm feeling disturbed about the whole thing. I feel disloyal to Ms. Minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work. Reading it, I can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it. Unlike what one reviewer of the movie said, it's not so much that some novels don't deserve to be a movie; it's more like some books just can't make the transition. Ms. Minton's novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character, so internally, that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm. Even though a lot of the book is memory of real events, it is memory, and so fragmented and ethereal as to be, I feel, not filmable. I think that Ms. Minton's work is a real work of literature, but cannot make the transition to film, which in no way detracts from its value.I cannot yet report that Evening, the film, does not represent Evening, the novel, in any more than the most superficial way, since I'm only halfway through, but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point. I guess I'm writing this because I feel that if you're going to adapt a novel, adapt it, but don't make it something else that it's not. I'm not sure if Michael Cunningham has done anything wholly original, but from what I can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else's work. We would not have The Hours if Virginia Woolf had not written Mrs. Dalloway, and we would not have Evening, in its distressed form, if Susan Minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place. But it's too much to say that it would be better if Ms. Minton had left well enough alone, because Evening, the film, is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own.Thus my confusion, mixed feelings, sense of disloyalty, and ultimate conclusion that, in this case, the novel cannot be the film and vice versa, and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did, so that we have both works as they are.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Since starting to read the book this movie is based on, I'm having mixed feelings about the filmed result.

Shahid Kapoor surprised me with a good performance. This is a major improvement, and most importantly he suits the role. The best is easily Amrita Rao. In fact, this is her best performance.

Not one actor feels out of place. The songs were quite disappointing but they will sound better after watching them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are nice ballads.

Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost. We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese. These were denser than typical Paneer. The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good. Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal. I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh. Regardless, it was tasty.

Now, she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends. Once there, they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn Donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt. pros: I got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves.An example:Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her (she doesn't seem that great) has escaped from prison. Their reason: They don't want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. LOLcons: Let me start off by saying I'm a huge slasher fan. Usually I can have fun with even the bad ones. I even like some PG-13 horror films. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also enjoy POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated PG-13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie.First of all, I had a big problem with the story. I like slasher films that don't even have stories. At least they can be entertaining. This is about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills her entire family. A few years later, he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends...? Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone cared about. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and I couldn't care less. This should have been a Lifetime feature, not a remake of PROM NIGHT. And then.... this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes. I don't even care that it's not that gory, some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) were not that gory but they still had effective murders. Here, we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen, a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds, and a closeup on a bad actor's face as he screams in agony. I'm sure that 10 year-old girls were terrified, but not me.I also hated the characters. There was Donna's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life, unless you are a gay male. Then we had Donna's annoying friends Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the token mean girl Chrissy (Brianne Davis). If you thought the characters in DEATH PROOF were annoying, try watching this movie.

{"original_text": "I normally wouldn't think Greek food for brunch or lunch; I'm way more of a traditional American-style brunch kind of guy. But when my friends suggested to meet them here for brunch this past weekend, I trusted their better judgement. In the end, I'm glad I did. This cozy Center City spot not only serves an amazing (and dare I say, a contender for the best) brunch in Philly, the staff really make you feel at home. They really know how to wow their patrons: fresh food, delightful presentation, and so many delicious sounding choices it's hard to choose which dish you want from their one page menu for mains. Their specialty, and they're not shy to tell you, is the Cyprus Breakfast. It's a mediterranean twist on the classic combination of eggs, meat, and starch. The plate comes out with two sunny-side up eggs, fried in olive oil and garnished with fresh parsely. It's served alongside a grilled slice of lounza (Greek ham), two pieces of salty, crisp fried halloumi, warm bread, and tomato, cucumber, and onion salad. The menu also features a spread of other traditional Greek, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern specialities: Avgolemono, Moussaka, Pastitsio, Shaksouka, and Malohwa to name a few. They even serve Greek Coffee and Frappes! The service may be a little over-attentive in an attempt to make you feel more than welcome, but it's much appreciated, especially when other restaurants fail to put as much effort into the service as they do the food. One other tip: reservations are highly recommended, if not required. Because of Kanella's small space, getting a table at brunch is nearly impossible if you're not on the list. But if you can score seats here for brunch, then expect nothing less than a stellar way to start your weekend morning (or recover from last night's activities).

But, overall it was solid Trek material and a good romp.I'll get the nits out of the way first. The opening theme is dull and I don't look forward to sitting through it regularly, but that's what remotes are for. What was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room. They need to cut that nonsense out.But, the plot was strong and moved along well. The characters, though still new, seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect. The Vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before, with a slightly ominous theme. I particularly liked the linguist, who is the first Star Trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death, but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears. They seemed to stay true to Trek lore, something that has been a significant problem in past series, though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields, the instant invention of technology that can fix anything, and the inevitable plethora of time-travel stories. Anyone want to start a pool on how long before the Borg show up?All in all, the series has enormous potential. They are seeing the universe with fresh eyes.

Firstly, the restaurant was clean and well-organized, which contributed to a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. The staff were friendly and efficient, providing excellent customer service. In terms of food, McDonald's never fails to impress with its extensive menu of Fast Food options. I opted for a Big Mac meal, which was cooked to perfection. The patty was juicy, the special sauce was delicious, and the fries were crispy and golden. The size of the meal was generous, and I felt satisfied without being overly full. McDonald's is also well-known for its coffee and tea, which I often indulge in when I need a quick pick-me-up. The coffee was hot and had just the right amount of sweetness, while the tea was refreshing and flavorful.

{"original_text": "I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed \"Clash of the Titans\"! It's an iconic fantasy film with some impressive special effects, memorable characters, and thrilling action sequences. I'm sure you were on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. However, you mention that you \"just feel that,\" suggesting that there may be something more that you're thinking about but haven't quite put into words. This is completely normal when reacting to a movie. One common critique of the film is the acting, particularly that of the lead, Sam Worthington, as Perseus. Some viewers find his performance flat or unconvincing. However, others argue that the special effects and action sequences are so captivating that they carry the film despite any shortcomings in the acting department. Another potential area for consideration is the film's adherence to the source material. The 1981 film is a loose adaptation of the 1924 play of the same name by Greek playwright, Pierre Grimmeau. Some fans of the original story take issue with the liberties taken by the filmmakers in creating new characters and changing the narrative. Ultimately, your reaction to the film is subjective, and only you can decide whether these or other factors influenced your enjoyment.

{"original_text": "In a nutshell: These guys are awesome to deal with. They came on time; They worked their butts off until the job was done; They were very tidy and considerate of my property; and I got exactly what was promised at a fair price. The Details: When my A/C went on a hot summer day I thought ugh, I wish I knew someone in the field. I didn't, so I started reading reviews and calling around. The main HVAC repair companies around town came across as contractors (middlemen) that would just end up costing me more money in the end. I knew what I wanted. I wanted to deal directly with the guy who was going to do the work. Someone who cared about customer satisfaction. Someone I could trust. I found all those things and more when I spoke to Ray, the owner and operator of Trust Home Comfort. When I read some of the reviews on the competition, it seemed that the biggest frustration out there were people who were charged a couple hundred of dollars to get a guy out, only to be told that their old A/C was not worth repairing. I didn't want that to happen to me, so I took the unorthodox approach of taking a brief video of my problem and posting it to YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iMHhimCqUo. This will be great, I thought. Saves everyone time, and hopefully me some money. Right? Wishful thinking, none of the big companies were even willing to look at the video. So I kept calling around. Eventually, I got a hold of Van (the office guy) at Trust Home Comfort. He was great! He said \"Sure, we'll have a look at the video\", so I emailed him the link with some photos of my system. I heard back a short time later from the owner of the company, Ray, who is a journeyman HVAC technician with a 4 year degree in Refrigeration Technology. Ray told me straight up that he didn't think the problem was what I was hoping it would be (a low cost contactor part), but in order to know for sure he would have to come out and run a diagnostic. They both reassured me that if I had to replace the entire system, I wouldn't be charged for the service call AND a new system. When Ray (the owner/technician) arrived the next day he took his electronic meter measurements, and was able to confirm that my compressor was shot. I would need a new system. We sat down to discussed my options. Ray was very honest and forthright about which system would be best for me. He took his time and shared his experience about what other customers have liked. No high pressure sales. No lies about pricing. Just the straight honest goods you would expect from a technician. I loved that. We ended up upgrading our HVAC system to one of the new units that is VERY quite and comes with a 10 year parts warranty. I think my neighbor was especially pleased with the \"quite\" part. Ray was even willing to do the job on a long weekend, even though he planned on taking it off.

{"original_text": "My Comments for VIVAH:- Its a charming, idealistic love story starring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom's families sleeping on the floor, playing games together, their friendly banter and mutual respect. Vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals. Yes, the central romance is naively visualized. But the sneaked-in romantic moments between the to-be-married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism. The film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom, on the wedding night, tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries: \"Come let me do your dressing\"V I V A H - showcases a lot of good things - beauty of arranged marriage, beauty of Indian culture, beauty of Indian woman, last but not least a nice IDEALISM of the about-to-be-couple waiting to get married..... playing by the rules! Simple yet Beautiful; Such a Simple story..... no plot.... no villain - as is the case with most of Sooraj Barjatya films. Sooraj sir is back to what he does BEST. He has made the movie with FULL CONVICTION. Its a very sweet film - which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout Arranged Marriage & the Union of 2 Families. I think AMRITA RAO - looks very good & she has acted very well. She has most of the good scenes - although I thought the last half hour was completely to Shahid Kapur - who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance. I also liked the acting of all others for ex. the Choti i.e. Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, Shahid's bro & sis-in-law. It almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could. Sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain. The chemistry between Shahid & Amrita is AWESOME.Stuff like Sanctity in a Marriage/Relationship, Avoiding Courtship, Mutual Respect, Care & Space, Waiting for getting Married \"officially\", Praying/Sacrficing for Ur Beloved - all these and more get SHOWCASED in Vivah. There's still some good audience who r going & enjoying this film. Some of the folks/audience are already excited after seeing, that they r thinking bout Arranged-Marriage:) Thats Success if you ask me. it seems AMRITA RAO - our actress-from-Vivah {Result for a nice performance} has been bestowed the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE award for 2006!! Hats off to her for this achievement Chalo, even though Vivah, Shahid or Amrita didn't get any of the film-fare & other awards; @ least this is news to CHEER about!! Congrats to AMRITA RAO- for showing us a visual of Indian Bride-to-be in the purest form and Of Course to Sooraj Barjatya for portraying her the best way:) Shudn't forget Shahid Kapur and all others who make VIVAH as sweet and legendary as it is today!! Imagine, to share the same pedestal as the legendary Dilip Kumar........... Its no mean achievement!! Congrats to Amrita Rao - for taking her Career to another level with this award..... I personally feel - she should keep doing movies only with Shahid Kapur!! They make a cute couple and their on-screen chemistry reminds me of {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla}.................. Some points that I observed,few of the elements:- #1 If u notice carefully, Amrita Rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses. She gives every bit of the Indian Woman essence - in this film!! Perfect Fit #2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us - not exactly ready for marriage or early-marriage..... but PREM listens carefully to the step-wise talk given by his DAD - having full faith in Anupam Kher. Eventually \"Honesty\" & \"Trust\" are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with Amrita. Most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person. But according to what I saw in this film, I have a feeling - that Two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also, Its possible!!! #3 In the entire movie - there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where Shahid & Amrita are together - or shown to be together. Its unlike most other romantic/wedding-based movies where Hero & Heroine are always singing/dancing or nowadays - doing cheap stuff. But the beauty of each of these 5 sequences:- Characterized by restraint, innocence & respect for the other! #4 I really liked the relationship shown between Chacha ALOK NATH & Amrita Rao. These kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters/girl-kids in some parts of India. #5 Romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely - no cheap scenes,songs are beautifully pictured!! Words like \"Jal\",\"praarthana\" e.t.c. are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film:) Personally, I really am fond of many dialogs in this film. #6 Last but not the least - The entire Hospital Scene where Shahid puts \"sindhoor\" to Amrita when shes struggling for Life - is terrific. Those dialogs between the couple are so touching and U feel the LOVE/I-cant-do-without-U; Its a Hats-Off feeling!!! *** In many ways, VIVAH reminded me of Maine Pyar Kiya, DDLJ, Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - for the freshness/on-screen-chemistry of the LEAD pair:):) *** IF U ASK ME:- Along with films like Rang De Basanti, Lage Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE and Kabul Express, V I V A H ranks among the best films made in 2006. IN FACT - I think Vivah does deserve better viewing/business than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all those time-pass/fuzzy/style/crap movies!!", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "My Comments for VIVAH:- Its a charming, idealistic love story starring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom's families sleeping on the floor, playing games together, their friendly banter and mutual respect. Vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals. Yes, the central romance is naively visualized. But the sneaked-in romantic moments between the to-be-married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism. The film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom, on the wedding night, tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries: \"Come let me do your dressing\"V I V A H - showcases a lot of good things - beauty of arranged marriage, beauty of Indian culture, beauty of Indian woman, last but not least a nice IDEALISM of the about-to-be-couple waiting to get married..... playing by the rules! Simple yet Beautiful; Such a Simple story..... no plot.... no villain - as is the case with most of Sooraj Barjatya films. Sooraj sir is back to what he does BEST. He has made the movie with FULL CONVICTION. Its a very sweet film - which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout Arranged Marriage & the Union of 2 Families. I think AMRITA RAO - looks very good & she has acted very well. She has most of the good scenes - although I thought the last half hour was completely to Shahid Kapur - who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance. I also liked the acting of all others for ex. the Choti i.e. Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, Shahid's bro & sis-in-law. It almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could. Sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain. The chemistry between Shahid & Amrita is AWESOME.Stuff like Sanctity in a Marriage/Relationship, Avoiding Courtship, Mutual Respect, Care & Space, Waiting for getting Married \"officially\", Praying/Sacrficing for Ur Beloved - all these and more get SHOWCASED in Vivah. There's still some good audience who r going & enjoying this film.

It's from Austria, and it attempts to stumble along in the footsteps of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet- scenes about various characters living in a suburban area with a dark underbelly. There's the fat dog owner and his fat maid wife who stripteases for him, the skinny divorcee whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the untouched room of his dead child, the \u00fcber-annoying woman hitchhiker who recites top ten lists.... The list goes on. Forever. Much like the two hours plus I spent in that theatre.Yes, the characters interact, but not in a clever or interesting or even relevant way. I couldn't say if they were any good as actors, as, according to the subtitles, they were given lines that were the Austrian equivalent of \"You are so lame!\" They certainly didn't have to learn many, as each repeated his or her same lines at least three times in a scene.This is no Gummo, or any of the aforementioned movies. There is no art to discover, and nothing to dwell on afterwards except maybe whether or not you should change your \"never walk out during a movie\" policy (which quite a few older couples did during a random orgy scene- and if that sounds appetizing, it's not, unless you're one of few who doesn't find the idea of your parents having sex- and with a few local middle-aged couples, to boot- revolting).This movie was offensive to me. Not the flabby nudity, not the cringe-inducing soundtrack, not the shockless scenes involving guns. I was offended that someone actually spent money to make this when there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding. I was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see Dog Days and come out wondering if that was the best us Montrealers could find.

I got a side order of the battered green beans. They were suppose to be spicy, but I was told they didn't make them spicy that particular day. Well, okay then. I ordered them anyways and I was so glad that I wasn't deterred by the fact that they weren't spicy because they were the most lightly battered, perfectly crunchy, and delicious green beans I have ever tasted.

{"original_text": "If, like me, you like your films to be unique, and unlike the majority of other movies, then I wholly recommend that you check out The Beast. The film is a grotesque, erotic, fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological'Beast' that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a French mansion and lusts after women. The film is very daring with it's subject material, and that is something to give it credit for. The theme of bestiality is a definite taboo, and for good reason, I might add; but the film conveys it; straight and to the point. Like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre, The Beast could have gone around it, and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps, but Borowczyk didn't do that, and he is brave in that respect, especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms, but the fact that he went ahead with it, in my view, means a big thumbs up for the guy.The film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female. This opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience, in some ways, for the incredible, tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see. The scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking, and are bound to offend many people (hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years), but these scenes are not merely an excuse for Borowczyk to shock the viewer; this film has a defining point. As said during the film; the only difference between man and beast is intelligence. Both man and beast have instincts, only man knows how to control them. The Beast explores this difference between man and beast through sexuality; the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears epitomises the control of human desire, and it is only when the central female character lets go of her control that she can see the beast. The film has strong themes of the age-old story of'beauty and beast' weaved into it, and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust, but not without a moral.Many criticise the scenes around the film's shocking sex sequences for being boring, but these scenes are important to the film's story. Without these scenes, we wouldn't get to know the characters or the story of the beast, and, most importantly; the story of'beauty and the beast' would not be able to have it's horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience, and as that is one of the key elements of the film; it would be a real shame. Besides that, Borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes, not with shocks, but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family, along with the beautiful shots of the mansion's ground would not be seen, and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either.Overall, The Beast is a shocking film. It's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone. However, if you can get over the film's shock, and embrace The Beast; what awaits is a skilful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "If, like me, you like your films to be unique, and unlike the majority of other movies, then I wholly recommend that you check out The Beast.

Yet, a trusted friend's recommendation led me to Nash Painting, and what an unexpected, delightful discovery it has been! The team's professionalism began with their prompt response to my inquiry. Each stage of the process - from the initial consultation to the final, magnificent reveal - was handled with efficacy and finesse that left me simply stunned. The Pressure Washers worked their magic on my deck, reviving it from its drab state, while our new railing adds a touch of elegance and safety. The Painters transformed our living space with their impeccable attention to detail, deftly handling color choices and textures that elevated our rooms' appearance. The Home Services division tackled various odd jobs with ease. What sets Nash Painting apart is their commitment to exceeding expectations.

{"original_text": "'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the Australian postal service, struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over-schematically represented. What's most disappointing of all, however, is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title: there's no mechanisation whatsoever, and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living. Granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s, if it ever truly existed. It's a shame, as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry, and there's some promise in the scenario: but few of the details convince.

{"original_text": "This is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life. The pacing, the camera work, the emotion, the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see. It isn't easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted. The only flaw I can see about this film is that it wasn't captured in a more technically perfect film format. It deserved Todd-AO, Technicolor and the very finest sound format available.(An intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter.) The gorgeous Italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard. As it is, it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film. I can't stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite. The transformations of the characters from contained, tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and I really should recommend it more often.The casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, the acting is above reproach. It is a film about middle age and the choices people make.It is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness. Watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you.

{"original_text": "I disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed \"masterpiece\" of the German New Wave: 1) There are major flaws in simple exposition, in the basic communication of critical plot points, as relating to Maria's abortion and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers understood that the husband agreed, in exchange for substantial financial remuneration, not to return to and reclaim his wife until Oswald was dead?2) The ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental. The original screenplay called for Maria to commit suicide after the reading of Oswald's will, on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide. Maria is then summarily blown up, rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self-delusion and moral compromise.3) Fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private, the political on the personal. Contrary to what the critics and \"experts\" assert, I don't think it works. Merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of German reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama. The selfish ambition of Maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so-called economic miracle of postwar Germany. Maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place, but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific. Women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self-advancement for ages. 4) Lastly, there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness -- Fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect.

{"original_text": "Dearest Reader, Please allow me to hereby confirm the rumors: Village Whiskey does, in fact, have the best burger in Philadelphia. And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. As my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to \"make me something awesome with whiskey in it.\" \"What kind of drink do you want?,\" he inquired. \"I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these.\" (Perhaps my banter wasn't quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the \"The Commodore\" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each. When our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can't wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious. Warning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table. All in all, the drinks were great, the food was delectable, and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable. I would totally come back.

{"original_text": "Sam Peckinpah's \"Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia\" (1974) is a cinematic experience like no other. For me, the film's greatness lies in its unique blend of genre elements, gritty realism, and unconventional narrative. Every scene is meticulously crafted to provoke an emotional response, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats. The film's story revolves around the unlikely anti-hero, Bennie, a piano player who finds himself in a bind when he is tricked into taking part in a macabre revenge plot. The twists and turns of the plot, coupled with the surrealism of the characters and situations, make for an unpredictable and engaging viewing experience. The violence in \"Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia\" is not only brutal but also stylish and visually arresting. Peckinpah masterfully choreographs each sequence, making every gunshot and stabbing a significant moment in the story. The use of music, particularly during the violent scenes, adds an unexpected layer of depth to the action. Moreover, the film's Mexican setting and exploration of Latin American culture provides a rich background that enhances the story's themes of revenge, morality, and survival.

They cater to the whole family with an impressive range of Children's Clothing as well as Men's Clothing. Their Adult section offers a broad selection of sizes to fit all body types and styles. Despite the large selection, the store was well-organized and easy to navigate\u2014a true testament to their Shopping experience.

It wasn't busy so I don't know why she felt the need to talk so fast. Decor was very nice.

We ordered a panzanella salad to share, we were both excited to get it based on its description on the menu and also because we both love a good panzanella. This was not panzanella, it was a field green salad with a few bread cubes in it. Very disappointing since the menu made it sound like a true panzanella. When we told the waitress and who we thought was the manager (she just nicely happened to stop by and chat) she said people had complained before because the salad had come to them and it was all bread cubes with other ingredients and no salad greens,....DUH! That's panzanella! How about educating people on what a proper dish is don't dumb it down! We ordered the pizza, one mushroom pizza with truffle oil, that was divine, great crust etc. we also ordered the hot pepper pizza which was disappointing. The crust was great but it was really just a cheese pizza with pepperoncini on it. We shared a lemon dessert that was quite good. The cost for lunch was somewhat expensive I thought. One appetizer, one salad, two pizzas and one dessert, no drinks, just water and the Bill with tip was $52. Might go back and just get pizza to go next time.

At night, that bus runs on a schedule that is anything but the one posted online. 1/2 hour, 45 minutes late. Really bad service."}

{"original_text": "I just went to Los Padres National Forest and I must say, it was an incredibly enjoyable experience! The forest offers a vast array of activities for nature lovers and adventure seekers alike. First and foremost, the natural beauty of the forest is breathtaking. With over 1,264 square miles of land, there's no shortage of stunning views, from the rolling hills and mountains to the picturesque rivers and streams. During my visit, I took advantage of the many hiking trails available and was not disappointed. The trails ranged in difficulty, allowing me to challenge myself while still enjoying the scenery. The forests were filled with lush greenery and wildflowers, and the sound of birds chirping and water flowing kept me company throughout my hikes. For those looking for a more active experience, Los Padres National Forest also offers plenty of opportunities for camping, fishing, and horseback riding. The forest is home to over 600 campsites, many of which offer stunning views and easy access to hiking trails. Fishing enthusiasts can cast a line in numerous streams and rivers, while horseback riders can explore the forest on designated trails. I was also pleased to find that the park is well-maintained and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable. They provided me with valuable information about the trails and safety precautions, ensuring that my visit was both safe and enjoyable. Overall, Los Padres National Forest is a must-visit for anyone looking to connect with nature and get some exercise. The forest offers a wide range of activities, from leisurely hikes to more strenuous adventures, and the natural beauty of the area is truly unforgettable.

I read reviews prior to arriving so I was prepared to wait. I was still a little surprised at how small this place is. We decided to wait around by the bar. After waiting for roughly 25 minutes, a spot opened up at a sit down counter, adjacent to the bar. For starters, we ordered the pickled red and golden beets along with turnips and black kale from their pickled section. We liked the pickled beets but the turnips and black kale surprisingly where our favorite. The acidity was mild and the black kale was crisp. The toppings I ordered on my burger were Rogue Smokey Bleu, caramelized onions, bacon, and a fried egg. I had high expectations for my burger and I was not disappointed. It was cooked to perfection. I wish I knew what grinds of meet they used to create their burgers because they had the right amount of fat to keep them moist and where full of flavor. I was underwhelmed with the duck fat French fries. They were okay, but nothing exceptional to me. The S'more milk shake was excellent! The homemade marshmallow had all the characteristics and nuances of their camp fire cousins. I woke up the next day, thinking about the burger I consumed the night before at the Village Whiskey.

Unfortunate close-ups of the monster reveal it to be nothing more than a piece of styrofoam.

{"original_text": "Amy Heckerling's second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of 1930's gangster films made in the Warner Brothers' tradition. Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has continuing health problems, so Keaton falls into crime at an early age via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin, yeah that's right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother turned district attorney, Glynnis O'Connor his wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton's moll. The film looks notoriously cheap, making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film.The film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialog and gags, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery doing his best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious, not funny. Piscopo does the \"once\" bit one time too many. Several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a desk sergeant, and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers. The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film.

These students may be Canadian or American, it's difficult to tell. That it was filmed in a Canadian forest rather than Ireland is rather obvious as well. One student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the \"dumb jock\" character from a number of kick ass 80's movie, except when he channels Randy from Scream. One character may be Chris Klein's stunt double. He has a girlfriend who probably gets killed, but it's never really established if that is true. One character is sullen and removed from her peers...just...cuz.... and then there's a blonde girl. Yay blonde girl.Ireland has a population of 2. They're cousins. Gary, who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast, is called \"sir\" more than once. He's very ominous and wears a knit cap. His cousin is a roughed up porn star with the worst Irish accent to befoul film in my lifetime and most likely beyond.Picturesque Ireland features many Canadian forests and swampy areas and 2 ducks which appear more than once in cut scenes.The producers got a discount on volume fake entrails. Good for them.Unbeknownst to me, horribly inbred freaks have access to brand spanking new hunting knives. Perhaps there's some kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the register.Also unbeknownst to me, if you inbreed for roughly 600 years, as the story leads us to believe happened, you end up being somewhat lumpy, yet amazingly spry and fairly strong. Genetics are a wonderful game of craps.There may or may not be more than one freak in this film. Reference is made to \"them\" and we see shadows, yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever. And when one odd looking dude is finally killed, apparently all danger is passed. I'm running with my initial assumption that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up, thus they just used the one. That's what it looks like on screen, anyway.Richard Grieco should be ashamed.Also of note, aside from those shiny new knives, the inbred freaks have access to some posh leather gear, as once Richard Grieco cuts his bonds, there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied up...who also then escapes, because the chains give you enough slack to just undo them, making one wonder why they even bother tying anyone up.A dead body in a shack will be maggot-ridden after what I would guess is about 2 hours has passed. Said dead body will also have glasses on, when no characters wore them. Curious.Jenna Jameson appears for no reason from stage left, chats for 2 minutes, vanishes stage left.

By favourite I don't mean something I like for now, I mean this film is so supernaturally perfect that there is never another animated experience going to touch it. This is obvious because I am never going to be a child again; I saw this film on ITV in the early nineties. I was 12 which is the age group this film is directed at, I'm also male, the gender that this film is intended for (the overwhelming majority of Miyazaki's protagonists are female). Consequently this film indelibly inspired my childhood psychology and I am forever indebted to Carl Macek (sp?) for producing the English dub of this film which is far superior to the Di$ney production which is not even funny - I've never even been able to watch that one - of course subtitled is the only way ultimately however the Macek version is SO good (the voices almost exactly corresponding to the original Japanese actors) that this version is available on the Japanese DVD! It's not available on any distribution in an English-speaking country. Go figure.There are hundreds of competent reviews so I'm going to put some trivia here, not that I'm the definitive archive of information for this film.First up I'd like to agree with the reviewer who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to review Miyazaki's films - they are so in their own league that they make almost the whole catalogue on IMDb combined pale into insignificance.The fascinating story with this film is that Miyazaki based the countryside around Slag's Ravine (Pazu's town area) on the Welsh mining communities. He visited Wales for a few months in the early 80s (might be late 70s) just after one of the great mining strikes. Being an avid supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight. The fight between the townsfolk and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man. The countryside and the clouds especially in this film remind me of where I grew up as his film depicts a fantasised version of the rolling hills of the midwest British Isles.The island is of course from Swift's genius satirical novel of the eighteenth century - the story in Swift's book is, deliberately, ridiculous. In Castle in The Sky, Miyazaki weaves together myths such as Atlantis and the Tower of Babel - I think the architecture in addition is based on Peruvian ruins though I'm not sure, someone told me that.Anyone who gets round to reading this review and who likes this film REALLY will want to check out Miyazaki's epic series Mirai Shounen Conan - Future Boy Conan - based on the short sci fi novel'The Incredible Tide' by Alexander key (novel is available online). Conan is basically a prototype for Laputa's Pazu and Shita. In addition you may not be familiar with his earlier work for Masterpiece Theatre - some of his key frame animation. He also did key frame for Sherlock Hound - this has some of the finest backgrounds I've ever seen too. Also check out Miyazaki and Takahata's first feature film Horus Prince of the Sun (1968) - amazing by today's standards in fact. What else.... Gauche the Cellist and The Flying Ghost Ship - though they're pretty rare.This film is such a gift, I don't know what we'd do without it with all this other crap storytelling around, this is like an oasis.

After this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg-1 in a place of Goaul'd/replicator/ori conflicts- The 8th season is probably the most mixed one.

They are both good continuations, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, because they seem to be about little more than SG-1 and human/Jaffa losing battle after battle to the Ori.Basically, after season 7, exploration was pushed to the background, which in many ways was a shame, because of the potential and mystery each planet(episode) presented; on the other hand, it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were.Even tough I believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest, the feeling I have is that it could go on; the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer.

Cooked to a perfect pink medium, it was juicy, seasoned to perfection, and simply melted in my mouth. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdactor Sides were also a hit! The natural cut fries, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, provided the perfect companion to the burger. And the Frosty? A heavenly blend of creamy ice cream and chocolate swirls that was both refreshing and indulgent. \ud83c\udf66 The service was friendly and efficient, and the ambiance - with its vintage red decor and smiling Wendy statue - transported me back in time. I felt like a kid again, savoring every bite of my burger in the warm, welcoming embrace of Wendy's. \u2764\ufe0f Overall, a definite recommend for those seeking a delicious, fast-food burger experience.

The ambiance was authentically Chinese with red lanterns adorning the walls and traditional artwork adorning the space. The staff were friendly and attentive, making us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. The menu offered an extensive range of dishes, showcasing the rich flavors of Chinese cuisine. I opted for the Kung Pao Chicken, which was cooked to perfection, with a nice balance of spiciness and savory umami flavors. My companion had the Mapo Tofu, which she devoured with great delight. The portion sizes were generous, and the presentation of the dishes was visually appealing. One aspect that truly impressed me was the affordability of the meal.

{"original_text": "Still being of school age, and having to learn Shakespeare almost constantly for the last four years (which is very off-putting of any writer, no matter how good), I didn't really expect to enjoy this film when my English teacher put it on; I thought it'd be the typical English lesson movie: bad acting, awfully shot, badly edited and the dreaded awful old dialog, so, as you can tell, I was all but ready to go into a coma from the go. However, I watched and, much to my disturbance, found myself not only paying attention, but actually enjoying the movie too. This production of Hamlet is possibly one of the best drama movies I have seen in a long time- and it really brings to life what I expect Shakespeare wanted his plays to be like (well, with the difference that this is cinema) much better than my English teacher harking over the text ever possibly could. The story is good, the dialog seems to flow with an unexpected grace that is far from boring (though a little hard to keep up with if you aren't used to Shakespeare's language) and even the smallest parts are performed with a skill you wouldn't expect; mainly, perhaps, due to the staggering number of cameos this movie has. Brian Blessed and Charlton Heston are as great as you'd expect these two veterans to be, even in such small parts, but it is Robin Williams as Osric and Billy Crystal as the Gravedigger who really stand out, giving such minor parts an unexpected zest, as well as offering some comic relief amidst the tragedy.The main stars, of course, are also wonderful. Kenneth Branagh excels as Hamlet, bringing not only the confusion and pain required to the roll, but also a sort of sardonic air which plays beautifully in the comic scenes, making the movie as a whole much more watchable. The other major players are also good, but it is Kenneth Branagh who stands head and shoulders above the rest in the title role.The set pieces, too, are often quite stunning, giving a refreshing change to the danky old castle corridors we're used to seeing in Shakespeare productions, as well as a real sense of the country around them.Of course, the movie, taken as a movie in its own right, is not without faults, but no major ones (the pacing is the only real problem I can think of offhand, as well as the prose for anyone not used to, as I said, Shakesperean language) and, especially when compared to the sort of Shakespeare productions I'm used to seeing in class, it really is quite brilliant.

I think the most ringing summary is that I have since moved ~1 mile further away from the Khyber, and I still go there just as often. I have now sampled most of the menu, but the truly excellent Southern barbecue is what usually calls to me.

{"original_text": "Title: \"Superfly 2\" - A Slick and Gritty Sequel That Exceeds Expectations \"Superfly 2,\" the long-awaited sequel to the iconic 1972 film \"Super Fly,\" comes roaring back with a vigor and energy that's both surprising and exhilarating. Director X and his team have managed to create a film that not only pays homage to the original but also carves its own niche in the crowded world of blaxploitation films. The narrative follows the infamous cocaine dealer, Priest (played once again by the charismatic Ron O'Neal), as he attempts to escape the criminal underworld and build a new life for himself and his loved ones, but not without a few bumps along the way. Newcomer Sheila Frazier shines as the determined but vulnerable Eddie, Priest's right-hand woman, who must navigate her own dangerous paths to protect her man and secure her future. The cinematography is impeccable, with bold, vibrant colors that perfectly convey the gritty and sometimes glamorous world of the drug trade. The score, composed by Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, seamlessly blends classic funk and soul with modern beats, resulting in a soundtrack that perfectly captures the film's tone. The performances are uniformly excellent, with O'Neal and Frazier delivering nuanced and commanding turns, while the supporting cast, including the always-menacing Jennifer Freeman and the magnetic Big Dog, add depth and complexity to the story. While \"Superfly 2\" may not reinvent the wheel, it's a slick, stylish, and gritty film that's sure to leave audiences craving more. It's a love letter to the original, but it also stands on its own as a solid addition to the blaxploitation genre. A must-watch for fans of the first film and newcomers alike.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "The sequel to one of the most iconic blaxploitation films of all time is a slick, stylish, and gritty film that's sure to please fans of the original but also introduce new audiences to the world of drug dealing in the 1970s and 1980s.

{"original_text": "Walerian Borowczyks La Bete (1975) was obviously received in different ways: Some were appalled, some were shocked others applauded the courage. I however am completely untouched, bored and cannot stop asking myself why the display of incoherent, inconsistent images which vaguely orbit around a central theme are considered an intellectual journey.What was this movie actually about? Growing sexuality in a woman? I've seen great films on this subject, but this is not one of them. How can one attempt to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person not only as a narrative device to dream (in the nude) of beasts. Where there are no characters, there is no character study. The woman persecuted by the beast was not adolescent, the girl having sex with the black butler (is he also characterized as a beast?) has a very grown up attitude to sexuality, so where is the consistency? Is it a movie about religion? If yes we would need a bit more thematic material than a priest without function, character and charisma, but with a strong desire towards two young boys.Is it about bestiality? The metaphoric feel of the movie forbids any realistic examination of bestiality, especially as realistic examination requires realistic characters. So no real bestiality here. Some mythic beast and two priests talking to each other about the sin of bestiality. Enough for a college essay on the topic? I don't think so.Is it about sex? Is it about anything? I don't know. I only know that showing a fired gun doesn't make a film a war movie. Dealing with a topic must mean more than displaying its own associations with the theme.So look across the controversy. Don't be scared by the bestiality, nudity, ejaculations, masturbation and stuff. I am not. Look at it as you look at any other story and you might discover that this is a poorly made, poorly edited, poorly acted, really poorly written (okay, some pictures are quite nice, and the main character is a really good looking girl) cerebral masturbation of a director who thinks beating around the bush in a hypnotic slow manner will make a story intelligent.

It also features a great cast, including Bill Murray in one of his earliest roles, and a memorable soundtrack. Additionally, the film explores themes of growing up, making friends, and finding love, which are universal experiences that many people can relate to.

This long-running animated series, which initially aired in 1989, continues to captivate audiences of all generations with its biting social commentary, clever interplay of characters, and unforgettable humor. In this latest installment, the writers demonstrate an uncanny ability to skewer contemporary issues while gracefully balancing a steady stream of nostalgia-inducing references to the show's rich history. The humor remains sharp, the satire remains poignant, and the characters - Bart, Homer, Marge, and the rest of Springfield's inhabitants - remain as endearing and relatable as ever. The Simpsons' artful blend of slapstick comedy, cutting sarcasm, and razor-sharp societal insights allows it to maintain its relevancy in today's complex world. Each episode is a masterclass in the art of storytelling, offering equal parts laughter, emotion, and thought-provoking commentary.

{"original_text": "I think this film has been somewhat overrated here. There are some things to admire in it; for one thing it deserves credit for being a science fiction(ish) film which relies on its story instead of special effects and action sequences to carry the day. The supporting cast is good, the set design and cinematography are good, and the ideas are interesting enough (though they are beginning to seem a little tired after the many mediocre Dark City / Memento / Fight Club clones of recent years). But the film is undone by poor characterization, wooden performances from the lead actors, and a laughably bad ending.The main problem I had was that the protagonist was neither likable nor unlikable. I realize that part of the story dictates that he should be a bit of a (wait for it...) cipher, but I was utterly unable to work up any empathy for a character that just seemed like a boring, anonymous schlub of a man. What character transformation there is for this sad sack is artificially forced on him by the plot. Lead actor Jeremy Northam succeeds in conveying that the protagonist is confused and hapless, but fails at inspiring any sympathy for him. Opposite him, Lucy Liu does what she can with a character who has no real personality of her own, unless being the embodiment of a spy-movie clich\u00e9 counts as personality.One of the biggest disappointments of this movie is the ending. I won't give any spoilers here, but I will say that a surprise twist at the end was telegraphed pretty clearly at least 45 minutes before it occurred. Further, after being content to be a quirky, idea-oriented movie for the first hour or so, the last few scenes suddenly and terribly devolve into the worst kind of Hollywood pap, complete with big explosions and special effects. The revealing of the film's McGuffin at the end is poorly done, and at the end the characters seem even less likable than they did before some of the film's main plot threads were resolved.The movie's not all bad, though. It does manage to maintain a certain low level of tension throughout most of it, despite the slow pacing (although I think I have a higher than average tolerance for slow-paced movies). And there are some moments when the unsettled, paranoiac feeling that director Vincenzo Natali was clearly trying to evoke rises to the surface.

{"original_text": "Title: Persona - A Masterpiece of Psychological Intrigue and Human Connection In the realm of cinematic art, there are films that leave an indelible mark on one's soul, and Persona, the hauntingly beautiful work of Swedish auteur Ingmar Bergman, is certainly one of them. This psychological masterpiece unfolds as a meticulously crafted labyrinth of human emotion, identity, and communication. The story follows Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann), a successful stage actress who suffers a breakdown upon losing her voice. Enter Alma Belgium (Bibi Andersson), a young nurse assigned to care for her, who finds herself drawn into a strange and complex dynamic with her charge. As the line between nurse and patient begins to blur, the women's interwoven stories of love, desire, and deception unravel in a mesmerizing dance of psychological intrigue. Persona is a sensory experience like no other; Bergman's masterful direction, coupled with Sven Nykvist's stunning cinematography and Schwarzschild's unforgettable score, transports the viewer to a world of vibrant colors, haunting imagery, and lush, evocative soundscapes. The performances from Ullmann and Andersson are pitch-perfect, their on-screen chemistry palpable and electric. With Persona, Bergman offers an introspective mirror on the human condition, delving deep into the depths of the soul and offering up a complex, layered meditation on identity, isolation, and the human need for connection. A true work of art that demands to be seen and savored, Persona stands the test of time as a must-see classic.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Ingmar Bergman's classic psychological thriller, A Masterpiece of Psychological Intrigue and Human Connection, will have its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) on Friday, 10 September, at the Princess of Wales Theatre in front of a sold-out audience of critics and filmgoers.... and then it's off to the Toronto Film Festival, where it will be screened on Saturday, 11 September, and Sunday, 12 September, as part of the festival's Un Certain Regard section, and on Monday, 13 September, when it will also be screened at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.. and on Tuesday, 17 September, the Toronto Centre for the Arts will host the world premiere of the film, which will be followed by a Q&A with the cast and crew, moderated by the film's co-writer and co-director, Stig Nykvist."}

{"original_text": "This gripping tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a sharper picture and crisper sound. My only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are difficult at times. Luckily even missing a word here and there won't spoil the fun: the primary actors are ideally cast. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, a go-for-broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable; her acting rivals her beauty.

My only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are difficult at times. Luckily even missing a word here and there won't spoil the fun: the primary actors are ideally cast. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, a go-for-broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable; her acting rivals her beauty.

{"original_text": "Curiously, it is Rene Russo's eyes and mouth--not Buddy the Gorilla's-- that emerge as the focal point of \"Buddy\", a Jim Henson Pictures production through Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope. Somehow, countless close-ups of Russo's face slipped passed in the post-production stages, and she literally fills the screen so many times the poor apes are upstaged. Unintentionally funny true story adapted from Gertrude \"Trudy\" Davies Lint's memoirs about a wealthy doctor's wife who turns their mansion into a menagerie for pets and wild-life. The movie goes beyond good intentions...it positively drips with earnest sincerity. The movie never sparkles with the kind of \"family film\" magic that it needed, and before too long both the people and the animals seem distinctly programmed (nothing here feels real). About ten minutes in, two chimpanzees are goofing around in Russo's kitchen and start throwing a butcher's knife back and forth (it misses Alan Cumming's head by inches); yet, no eyebrows are raised because it's all in a day's fun. Still, when full-grown gorilla Buddy gets crazy during a thunderstorm, the cops are called--and everyone stares at Buddy through the window while he busts up the living room furniture. The furniture should be the least of anyone's worries in this flabbergasting, do-gooder failure.

It portrays super-religious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city, and the main character's experiences interacting with them in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of Milyang ('Secret Sunshine' in Chinese) from Seoul with her young son.

She does not react well to the overtures of the local Christian zealots, one of whose members tries to convince her to come to their church and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially irreligious and brushes these people off as politely as she can.

Strictly a bar, they have a full liquor selection and a variety of draughts and a slew of whiskeys that are sure to please even the pickiest of alcohol drinkers. In addition, the bar houses a cigar case for those who like to light up while drinking when the mood strikes them. The bar has an outside covered patio which is nice for enjoying the lovely Florida weather. I always appreciate a bar where I can sit outside and people watch and get some fresh air. With the bar being at the base of the high rise residential Element, there is surely a good amount of people watching to occur. There is metered street parking or if you visit on the weekend, you're in luck: free on street parking in metered spots. The bar has pool tables and dart boards as well as TV trivia for the guests entertainment. There are well, beer, and martini specials everyday during their happy hour from 12-7pm. I would be sure to ask your bartender about the offerings, as they are not readily posted. If hunger strikes when you are there, there is a list of local restaurants and food options in the area, and those that deliver are marked. Duckweed Urban Market is a few doors down and you can get quick snacks or prepared meals from there. All in all, I enjoyed my pleasant experience at the bar. Knowledgeable staff, the decor, and the crafted drink were a hit in my book. It might be worth noting that Paddywagon won the award for the best Bloody Mary from the 2015 Bloody Mary festival this year. Props to them and this nice addition to the downtown scene. It might be important to note that on this particular occasion it was a rainy, stormy day and we popped in during an odd-off time, like around 3:30pm on a Saturday so that is why there were few bar patrons as pictured.

{"original_text": "It got to be a running joke around Bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any Cartwright men. After all Ben Cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage. And any woman who got involved with Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe were going to end up dying because we couldn't get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic TV western.Perhaps if Bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the Cartwrights. People have relationships, some go good, some not so good, it's just life. And we're less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don't have to kill the character off to keep the survivor's nobility intact. But that's if Bonanza were done today.But we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped, the secret of Bonanza's success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his stalwart sons. Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name. His whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense Ponderosa spread for his three children. The kids were all different in personality, but all came together in a pinch.The Cartwrights became and still are an American institution. I daresay more people cared about this family than the Kennedys. Just the popularity that Bonanza has in syndication testifies to that. Pernell Roberts as oldest son Adam was written out of the show. Rumor has it he didn't care for the noble Cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious. Perhaps if it were done now, he'd have liked it better in the way I describe.This was just the beginning for Michael Landon, how many people get three hit TV shows to their credit. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, most hot headed, but the most romantic of the Cartwrights. When Roberts left. the show kept going with the two younger sons, but when big Dan Blocker left, the heart went out of Bonanza. Other characters had been added on by that time, David Canary, Tim Matheson, and Ben Cartwright adopted young Mitch Vogel. But big, loyal, but a little thick Hoss was easily the most lovable of the Cartwrights. His sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family.So the Cartwrights of the Ponderosa have passed into history. I got a real taste of how America took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City. It doesn't look anything like what you see in Bonanza.

Simon, who adapted the script from his play (which goes uncredited), equates old age with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for 43 years, which begs the question \"how long did vaudeville last, anyway?\"). Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of Neil Simon's screenplays; here, Ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent Matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to tone down the character, to nuance his temperament to give \"The Sunshine Boys\" some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf.

I started my meal with a cup of their signature Broccoli Cheddar Soup. The rich, creamy texture and perfectly combined flavors of broccoli, cheese, and herbs were simply irresistible.

Its almost *guaranteed* the movie will be bad (e.g. Congo)if Hudson is in it (with the exception of the Ghostbusters films, which were intentionally campy and bad). Despite my instincts, and the fact that I just saw Civil Brand, yet another cinematic \"tour de force\" starring Lisa Raye, I rented it anyway. After all, I ignored my \"Hudson instinct\" on OZ and ended up watching a very quality series so I figured I'd give this movie a chance.If you are a lover of bad movies, this is a definite must see! This has got to be the most unintentionally funny movie I've seen in a loooong time. The plot is fairly straightforward: Racheal's (Monica Calhoun) sister is killed by a band of brigands (Led by Bobby Brown!) and, like many an action movie before this, she straps on her guns ONE LAST TIME and vows to avenge her sisters death. To do this, she reassembles the titular Gang of Roses (supposedly based on a true story of a female gang) and they go out and exact revenge and, along the way, there's some subplot or something or other about some gold that might be buried in the town. One nice thing I will say about this movie is that from what I could tell, the stars did their own riding and they looked GREAT galloping.The funniest (albiet unintentionally funny) scenes? Look for when they introduce Stacy Dash's character or when Calhoun's character rescinds her vow not to strap on her guns (replete with a clenched fisted cry to the heavens) or Lil' Kim's character joking with Lisa Raye's character or Stacy Dash's character being killed or Lil' Kim's character convincing Lisa Raye's character to rejoin the gang or the Asian Chick or Macy Grey's character talking bout \"The debt is paid\", etc. With the exception of Calhoun's Racheal and Bobby Brown's Left-Eye, I can't even remember the names of the other characters cuz I was laughing so hard when they were introduced.If the director had gone for parody and broad comedy this would have been a great movie. Unfortunately, he tries to take it seriously seemingly without first taking exposition, sound design (in his defense, Hip-Hop is notoriously difficult to work into a period piece), set design, script writing nor period historical research (was it me,or were these the cleanest people with the whitest teeth in the old west?) seriously.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I should have known when I looked at the box in the video store and saw Lisa Raye - to me, she's the female Ernie Hudson A.K.A. \"Le Kiss of Death\" for *ANY* movie.

Look for when they introduce Stacy Dash's character or when Calhoun's character rescinds her vow not to strap on her guns (replete with a clenched fisted cry to the heavens) or Lil' Kim's character joking with Lisa Raye's character or Stacy Dash's character being killed or Lil' Kim's character convincing Lisa Raye's character to rejoin the gang or the Asian Chick or Macy Grey's character talking bout \"The debt is paid\", etc. With the exception of Calhoun's Racheal and Bobby Brown's Left-Eye, I can't even remember the names of the other characters cuz I was laughing so hard when they were introduced.If the director had gone for parody and broad comedy this would have been a great movie. Unfortunately, he tries to take it seriously seemingly without first taking exposition, sound design (in his defense, Hip-Hop is notoriously difficult to work into a period piece), set design, script writing nor period historical research (was it me,or were these the cleanest people with the whitest teeth in the old west?) seriously."}
{"original_text": "I saw this film a while ago on a Video CD.I will 1st mention the good points.The movie, at first, at least tries to appear that it is not biased, like not showing one character as black and the other as white. Both main characters are friends and co-exist very well in an country and economy that is not booming while at the same time not failing. Their families get together and have parties and they practice their favorite sport, Sport Rifle shooting, as comrades not as competitors.But, after the 1st 15 minutes the plot runs into a fork in the road. The audience is expected to believe that for some unknown reason these friends must hate each other. That for some unknown reason Bosnia is now on a path to conflict. Sure, the script adds in TV footage which the characters appear to be watching live news programs in English, but the clips are from 1993 not 1992 when the war began.The history, the 1990 elections, the people who caused the war are not mentioned. The movie tries to place the blame with Karadzic, who had been a Presidential candidate and leader of the Bosnian Parliament's 2nd Largest Party(SDP). According to the Constitution of Bosnia, the SDP was to have the Presidency in 1992, but there was a Coup in January. The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Action Party seized total control and held a segregated referendum in March in which it declared itself the law in Bosnia and announced Secession.The history of the IDAP begins with Bosnian Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, a man suspiciously absent from \"STtH\". He was a student of Nazism in WW2. He even wrote his own \"Mein Kampf\" in which he stated: \"It is not in fact possible for there to be any peace or coexistence between'the Islamic Religion' and non-Islamic social and political institutions\".In 1990 he lost the IDAP elections to \"pro-Yugoslavia Moderate\" Fikret Abdic, a Bosnian Muslim, that worked with Christian Serbs during the Civil War, and who treated his supporters like brothers. Abdic was prevented from taking power by Izetbegovic, who lost the elections but seized the seat of power.The events from above are missing from the movie, but they are the factual events that lead to the war.There were problems with props too.

{"original_text": "Well, where to begin? I guess I can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed. Call me ignorant for not knowing of Schneebaum's book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that I have been living under some kind of a rock, but don't blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this \"documentary\" is actually a companion to said book. Yeah, I felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why I sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a \"Modern Cannibal Tale.\" I mean, am I a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes? I certainly didn't expect an hour and forty-five minutes of one old geezer kissing his own ass by whining about every little detail of his dull and worn out life. I certainly didn't expect the insipid directing and I most notably did not foresee myself laughing so hard at Tobias Schneebaum and all of his off-putting glory.Schneebaum is indeed unlikable. The old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of his even though he isn't even that interesting a character to fill a story. Oh really? He was a cannibal? Ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding Schneebaum's dirty past. The only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when Tobias finally breaks his little silent treatment about what happened to him in Peru and say that he had \"a small piece.\" That's it, folks. Ninety minutes of bull later and Tobias Schneebaum is a cannibal by three inches. It's like calling a movie \"The Life Of A True Don Juan\" only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when he once played \"just the tip.\" Unbelievable.The directing is, indeed, superbly ghastly as there is no flow or rhythm to the story that is being told. Alright, I understand that I didn't read Schneebaum's volume before watching his celluloid tale of it, but I can still recognize some bad pacing and even worse editing. One minute Schneebaum is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next he's going on and on about how he can't drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative or some failed and miserable saga in his life. I mean, Jesus, can you at least slam his back story to the first part; follow up with some stuff covering his homosexuality and then end it off with a hearty look into his visit to Peru? Also: I don't particularly care much for Schneebaum's insipid little quips on life and living, but I at least implore the old man to keep consistent with his ramblings. If I hear a guy talking about how he prefers life in the jungle I don't expect him to suddenly bitch and moan about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later. Absurd.Another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which our hero has appeared. While some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story, the director has overused the gimmick and broken his entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reels.The bottom line, here, is that Tobias Schneebaum is a fraud. Pure and simple. I know that I haven't read the book, but I'm still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own. This documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an avid fan of Schneebaum's work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a DVD. Schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy, striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that his story is remarkably un-riveting. If you're looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism, turn away because \"Keep The River To Your Right\" is an embarrassingly hilarious self-serving rant over a man who is long overdue for a straight-jacket and a gag.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Well, where to begin?

{"original_text": "I too was intrigued by the high (8.5) rating for this film, and was very disappointed. I had just seen a couple of good foreign films and was looking forward to making it three in a row, but it was not to be. I went with a spanish speaking friend who felt the same way. There is not much of a plot, if any. I don't necessarily need that in a movie, but it needs to somehow entertain or bring me in.

There is not much of a plot, if any. I don't necessarily need that in a movie, but it needs to somehow entertain or bring me in.

An example of the directing: When Candy (Jean Peters) starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing, an alarm goes off in the background in the building she's in -- as if it's an alarm going off in her head. It's not cartoon-like -- it's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you've seen the film a few times and it just \"clicks\" that there's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag.Richard Widmark is way on top of his game as a smart-alec -- he's really great -- but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for \"Moe,\" the street peddler/informer, played by Thelma Ritter. Later, in her apartment, you are not seeing a movie -- you're seeing a real person. I've never seen anyone \"act\" so real I felt like I was looking into a real room until Ritter's performance -- right down to the way her hair stuck out a bit when she removed her hat.

{"original_text": "Although only a short distance from the French Quarter, Frenchman Street is like stepping into a different realm. It's only two-blocks long but full of life and non-stop entertainment and on any given day of the week, you can hear the live sounds of reggae to Latin to blues. To kick off a night on Frenchman Street, it's best to do so on a full stomach so stopped into Mojitos Rum Bar and Grill on the edge of Frenchman Street for dinner and a warm up to a night out on the town. Just like a lot of the other places in the area, Mojitos has their own live entertainment and if u stay late enough on Saturdays a Latin music party. All of this takes place on their beautiful patio but you also do have the option of indoor dining but I highly recommend that you do not do that. Even consider sitting at their large outdoor bar before doing that. Going to a place called Mojitos means you have to get a Mojito. Due to their namesake, they have plenty of options from specialty drinks to the typical fruit flavor kind. I started off with The Frenchman which was amazing and thank fully strong. Later on, I decided to get another drink and selected the Ultimate Mojito. I know it said mint syrup and I don't know what I was thinking but it was the ultimate fail. It tasted just like syrup, medicine syrup. If you'bout that sizzrup, this may be the drink for you. We order the Jerk Chicken Skewer as a starter and it was so unbelievable delicious! Do you know how hard it is to go to a place that doesn't specialize in Jamaican food and for them to actually get it right? The flavors were on point and the spice level was beyond expectations. To offset the spicy factor, the blackberry brandy sauce added just the right touch. There are only four choices for main dishes, but they all sounded so good, I still had a hard time deciding. I ended up ordering the Aruba Scallop. It came with grits and I am actually NOT a fan of grits but these were well flavored and a great compliment to the delicate and well cooked and prepared scallops. A dish like this has potential to lack flavor, but it was really good and had a nice kick to it. My boyfriend ordered the Lechon Asado or as the menu states, citrus marinated roasted Kurobota pork belly. The meal was served with rice and beans. He thought it was really good taste wise, but was disappointed in the portion size which I guess was a little small but I was full after eating my meal.

Regardless, I'm happy that you found \"Mr. Chance\" enjoyable. If you have any recommendations for similar movies or films in the same genre, I'd be happy to help you out."}

The jokes (which are few and far between) are NOT funny in any way.... the story line is crap, and they never answer the question.... WHERE DOES THE SH*T GO? Of course the answer to that is NO ONE CARES. This film lacks any sort of comedy value, and as a few other users have said the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching is Christopher Walken as the J-man. None of the characters are developed, the plots so thin it's nearly transparent - and is that song throughout the film supposed to be funny??", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I watched'Envy' two nights ago, on DVD, at a friends house.

{"original_text": "I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed \"Full House\"! I can understand how watching the classic sitcom can bring back fond memories or create a sense of nostalgia. If you're feeling that, then you might be in the mood for more 90s and early 00s TV shows that evoke a similar sense of nostalgia. Here are some suggestions: 1. \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\": This comedy series, which starred Will Smith, aired from 1990 to 1996 and is known for its catchy theme song and humorous take on life in a wealthy neighborhood. 2. \"Friends\": Another classic sitcom from the 90s, \"Friends\" follows a group of friends living in New York City and dealing with relationship, career, and life issues. 3. \"Gilmore Girls\": This fast-paced dramedy centers around a mother-daughter duo and their quirky town, and is known for its quick dialogue and pop culture references. 4. \"That '70s Show\": Although it aired in the late 90s and early 00s, \"That '70s Show\" is set in the 1970s and explores the lifestyle and culture of that decade. 5. \"Boy Meets World\": This coming-of-age sitcom follows a group of friends growing up in the suburbs and tackles a range of issues from relationships to social issues.

{"original_text": "Title: A Timeless Tale of Racial Tension and Justice Served: \"In the Heat of the Night\" \"In the Heat of the Night,\" directed by Norman Jewison and released in 1967, remains a powerful and thought-provoking film even in today's context. The movie tells the story of Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier), a black police consultant from Philadelphia, who finds himself in the small, racist town of Sparta, Mississippi, during a murder investigation. The film masterfully explores the themes of racial tension, justice served, and the complexities of prejudice. Poitier's portrayal of Tibbs is brilliant, as he skillfully navigates the hostile environment, pushing the boundaries of segregation while delivering a gripping detective story. Rod Steiger, as the local police chief, Bill Gillespie, delivers a heartfelt and raw performance, showcasing his character's growth and change in perspective. The cinematography is stunning, with the small-town setting in contrast to the urban cityscape of Philadelphia. The score by Quincy Jones adds depth to the narrative, further emphasizing the emotional impact of the film. Despite being over 50 years old, \"In the Heat of the Night\" still resonates with modern audiences. Its portrayal of racial prejudice and its exploration of the human capacity for change are as relevant today as they were over half a century ago. This film is a must-watch for anyone looking to expand their understanding of historical American cinema with a critical and thought-provoking eye on society and human nature.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "One of the most iconic films of the 1960s is being released on Blu-ray this week, marking the 50th anniversary of the release of \"In the Heat of the Night.\" The film, starring Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger, explores the themes of racial tension, justice served, and the complexities of prejudice in a small, racist town of Sparta, Mississippi, during the murder investigation of a black police consultant from Philadelphia, who finds himself in the town during a murder investigation, as the film's director, Norman Jewison, revisits the setting for the first time since the film was released 50 years ago this week.

The film's portrayal of a seemingly unstoppable killing machine may be unsettling to some viewers, especially given the realistic way it was portrayed for the time.

I'm a Southerner, and must have some historical memory.Watching the Tobey McGuire character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave, as he looks at the scalps of blacks and Germans (his ethnic background) being wagered at a poker game.....was interesting.

The wife, who is forced into her marriage, shows both lust and a strong will, characteristics we're not used to seeing in'respectable Victorian southern belles'.The crazy wacked out renegade southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin, head of the Copeland Horse-thieving Gang, Inc. in Mississippi, was hung about that time. Bands of homeless men were roaming the countryside, armed. Remind you of Iraq? And how similar we are underneath the facade of religion and ethnic background?

That's Mesopotamia, now called Iraq, who happen to have the misfortune to sit on oil. The wild-eyed killers in Missouri, raiding Lawrence, Kansas could as easily be the insurgents we're fighting now with no success.Another anomaly was the father's tribute to the Yankees who move into Lawrence and erect a school \"even before they erect a church. And for that reason, they'll win.\" Huh????? I was taught history in Birmingham, Al and we were taught that the North was much more industrial and richer.....that's why they won. Course, they also LITERALLY had God on their side. As you see here, when the freed slave indicates that he's cutting out to free his mother, sold into slavery in Texas. God, what a horrible legacy slavery gave us.Acting pretty good, lots of blood and gore as the warriors ride gleefully into battle (but didn't hear any rebel yells, so reminiscent of football games in Alabama). You also get a real feeling for how stupid the war was, as the bushwackers and jayhawkers gather their forces for another raid. They have lost sight of why they're fighting, and so do we.

So much suffering for such a stupid cause.The cinematography is fantastic. Now I have to get back to the DVD and get the production notes, one of my favorite parts of any movie. I suspect that this movie was written by a Gore Vidal, as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era, if you knew History. The dialogue is definitely thought-provoking. Not your ordinary blood and guts war movie, by any means. You see the wounded but still active-duty soldiers, still fighting cause they have nothing else to do. You see the southern raiders, living off the land, stealing indiscriminately. Yet, at the beginning, you've seen the battle stop, so the women could be evacuated from danger.

Then I ordered a bowl of corn and crab soup. Great flavor and a half Caesar salad which had fresh, crisp lettuce, toasted, seasoned croutons and plenty of Caesar dressing. All very flavorful. All that and an Imported bottle of Italian water for $10. I used one of the $5 off coupons direct mailed to my home. You order at a counter.

Specializing in sandwiches, pizza, soups &salads, all fresh and taken up a notch. I chose Newk's Q sandwich which is sliced, flame broiled chicken, thick cut bacon and imported Swiss cheese served in a crispy semi-soft sub roll with their signature white BBQ sauce. Very delicious. Then I ordered a bowl of corn and crab soup. Great flavor and a half Caesar salad which had fresh, crisp lettuce, toasted, seasoned croutons and plenty of Caesar dressing. All very flavorful. All that and an Imported bottle of Italian water for $10. I used one of the $5 off coupons direct mailed to my home. You order at a counter.

{"original_text": "This place was fantastic. The pizza rolls are not similar in shape to those frozen things; they're actually made like cinnamon rolls, with pizza dough instead of pastry and sauce/fillings instead of cinnamon sugar. They're amazing. I got one of the daily specials, which was puppy drum (fish) with a side of pasta. I wasn't a huge fan of the fish, but I think I just don't like puppy drum as much as I expected to. It was prepared fine, though. The pasta is obviously homemade and the marinara is delicious. My boyfriend got a dish that I can't remember the name of, but it was basically pasta, shrimp, and mushrooms in a rich butter sauce. Shrimp Diane maybe? It was very good. I actually ended up eating his leftovers, and I might get that next time. The bread is good, though very full of sesame seeds, so beware if that's not your thing. We finished with the tiramisu. The flavor was great, but the texture was too wet for my taste. Again, it's more a matter of taste than anything they did wrong. We'll definitely try the \"cherrymisu\" next time, which is tiramisu but with cherry juice in place of coffee. The service was fantastic, the place was clean, it was easy to park. However, my absolute favorite thing was hearing one of the cooks tell another, \"I'll be back, I'm going to go peel some shrimp.\" I love a place that uses fresh seafood and does things without cutting corners. I will 100% be returning, and I'm already thinking about what I'm going to order.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This place was fantastic.

The film follows the story of a hapless, unlucky everyman named Harper (Tye Sheridan) and the serendipitous encounter that sets his life on a deadly and twisted course. The cinematography of Detour is stunning, with each frame masterfully capturing the eerie beauty and isolation of the desert. The desolate landscapes, dimly lit interiors, and winding roads create a disorienting and claustrophobic atmosphere that perfectly complements the story's labyrinthine plot.

His portrayal of innocence and vulnerability, counterbalanced by a growing cunning and resourcefulness, keeps the audience engaged and invested. The supporting cast is equally compelling, with characters that are both memorably sinister and sympathetic. The script, penned by first-time writer Jason Smilovic, is brimming with clever dialogue, unexpected twists, and intriguing moral dilemmas.

Context: It was our Golden Anniversary last night, 6 years on the 6th.... We had just briefly met Exec. Chef Casey Frank at an event this last Thursday, and decided to celebrate at Livery as we'd been meaning to stop by for awhile now. It seems he must have 1.) seen us come in; 2.) recognized who we were from the event; and 3.) remembered we had mentioned it was our anniversary that night - because after we placed our order of a salad and two entrees, the server came back out and informed us we should \"...forget about your order\" and wait for the experience Chef had lined up for us.... What followed was an astounding 8-course small plate journey, with some of the most delicious and memorable flavor profiles we've encountered in Indianapolis. Chef Casey came out on two occasions to chat with us about the food and make sure we were having a good time. We felt like nothing short of royalty at 6:30pm on a Sunday. Food: (I'll highlight just a few dishes so as not to write a novel) Sweet Plantains were culinary genius. Sweetness of the plantain, saltiness of black bean puree, spice from the habanero guajillo sauce, and brininess of the pickled onion in the pineapple salsa were perfectly balanced. The combinations were so complex, but you could still individually identify each component and the role they played in the dish. Pork Tenderloin could be cut with a fork and was full of flavor. Slight char on the outside gave it smoke, which was complemented by an incredible sweet corn puree and spicy serrano hot sauce. Scallop was the most well-prepared I've had in a long time. Perfect golden-brown sear on the outside, and so tender with not one bite of grit.... A feat that, in my book, is quite an accomplishment! Served with a roasted carrot and poblano pico garnish, it was another masterful balance of sweet and heat while letting the seafood shine. Churros were a playful and well-executed nod to Latin street fare. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a wonderful caramel sauce that was obviously made in-house. Service: Our server Tommy was a delight, from the first moment when he brought us 2 complimentary champagnes to toast. Friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive, he engaged my wife and I just enough to provide quality service and make sure everything was in order, while giving us privacy to enjoy each other's company. We very much enjoyed his service! I honestly don't know what we did to deserve such a gift, but sincere and heartfelt thanks - To Chef Casey, Tommy, and Livery - for making our Golden Anniversary so very special.

The selection of bagels was impressive, with a variety of flavors and textures to choose from. But what really sets NY Bagel & Deli Shop apart is the quality of their bagels. They were perfectly cooked, with a crispy exterior and a soft, tender interior that melted in my mouth. The food offerings went beyond just bagels, with a selection of savory and sweet dishes that were mouthwatering. I tried the lox and cream cheese bagel and the matzo ball soup, both of which were delicious. The coffee and tea selection was extensive and the drinks were expertly brewed, providing the perfect accompaniment to my meal. And for those looking for something more substantial, the deli also offered a range of burgers and sandwiches.

I remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the fact Molly Ringwald was in town...Storyline...Essentially 20 years after a film was \"laid to rest\" without being finished, a group of film students set out to complete it - with dire consequences. It would seem someone does not want the film completed.The storyline is flimsy. One has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek, but it had no real oomph. The characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just don't care about, it seems irrelevant. It is weird hearing Kylie's accent as Australian again and nice to see a kid I went to school with in a starring role. But that doesn't redeem the film at all. Goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in Molly Ringwald. Perhaps due to the nature of the film (it sort of pays homage to 80s films / bad horror films)but really an Aussie actor would have done just fine.As far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed constipated. Some of these kids (especially the two main chics - they played \"director\" and \"producer\") looked like they were trying to act. That is never a good look. Also, the shots had a rough feel about them. Over lit perhaps? Just not as smooth as one is used to.The killer. Lord. Could it be less frightening? There are some shock factors though, and a couple of gross scenes. I did like the film, but it was not great. It went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less. Perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better. They had a lot of characters get killed - but no real build up to them getting slayed.

{"original_text": "The new JW Marriott in downtown Indianapolis is a stellar place to stay when in town. I've been watching it rise from the ground for the last couple of years and was thrilled to finally have it be open and willing to accept my corproate rate! I did the self park on this occasion - no issues there for the majority of the time. There was one big convention for a few days where parking was a major issue and they had people directing traffic out front and in the garage. Hopefully, they'll be better prepared for similar events in the future - it was really frustrating to take 15 minutes to get parked after coming back from a long day of class. Anyway, the check in process was smooth and it seems to be a thing at this hotel to walk guests to the right elevators. Pretty slick...the elevators were problematic a time or two (not working correctly), but I kind of chalk that up to new hotel bugs. The whole feel of the hotel is kind of natural modern...kind of a midwestern twist on scandanavian design. Lots of wood and organic items around the hotel. Very comfortable, very lovely. The room was great - I was put in a nice room on the concierge level. Huge space, great furniture, comfortable bed, no issues with the internet and a really over the top shower with multiple spray heads, etc. Judging by the photos below, I think the rooms on the concierge level might be a little bigger than the standard rooms...but, it's good to have Marriott Status! The concierge lounge was fabulous. Awesome selection of food in the evening - you could just about have dinner up here - 4 or 5 various salads each night in addition to the normal heavier goodies. The breakfast was fairly standard and theall day snacks (local gourmet popcorn while I was there) was tasty! The gym was well stocked for a hotel facility. Lots of equipment and a really great variety as well. Love that the cardio machines overlook the city - makes the workouts go by much more quickly. They also have a nice small pool, hottub and mat area where you can use a balance ball or get some yoga stretches in. One major issue during the stay that came up was quickly addressed by the staff and management.

This film is a vivid, immersive experience that transports audiences to medieval Spain, weaving a tale of loyalty, love, and the intricacies of power through its resplendent visuals. Besides the dazzling cinematography, the ensemble cast delivers stellar performances. Russel Crowe, as Rodrigo Diaz, commands the screen with a subtle, nuanced portrayal of the legendary hero. Furthermore, the supporting actors, including Claudia Fern\u00e1ndez as Jimena, and Jacques Perrin as King Alfonso VI of Castile, enrich the narrative with their evocative performances. The screenplay, while rooted in history, is both respectful and inventive in its retelling of the El Cid legend. It showcases the complexities of the time, exploring themes of power, loyalty, and family in a way that resonates with contemporary audiences. The action scenes are meticulously choreographed and executed, capturing the brutality and exhilaration of medieval warfare. In contrast, quieter moments between characters reveal poignant and heartfelt dialogue, bringing depth to the characters during their transformations.

{"original_text": "\"The Phantom of Liberty\" is a unique and unconventional film that defies traditional narrative structures. Directed by Lisandro Alonso, the film consists of several loosely interconnected vignettes that explore themes of freedom, morality, and the human condition. Each scene features a distinct set of characters and settings, yet they all seem to be connected by a thread, leaving the viewer to piece together the connections.

{"original_text": "I first came across this film when I read a book (written in the 1970s) about the career of Mitchell Leisin. I have to admit that over the years I have watched many of his films and find his best work really high quality. SWING HIGH, SWING LOW was supposed to be one of his best. While it did not bore me, it did not impress me as much as HOLD BACK THE DAWN, DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY, KITTY, or even GOLDEN EARINGS. I suspect it just dates too much now to be well liked.Working at Paramount Leisin had a problem in those films that he did which were musicals. Most of the scores he worked with were fairly mediocre. It's true that twice standards appeared in his films, but they were really rare cases: \"Cocktales for Two\" appeared in MURDER AT THE VANITIES, and \"Mona Lisa\" came out of CAPTAIN CAREY, U.S.A. But the rest of the score for MURDER AT THE VANITIES was forgettable. \"Mona Lisa\" was the only tune in CAPTAIN CAREY. It shouldn't have been this way - Leisin's studio had Rogers and Hart working for it in the early 1930s. Why couldn't he have been assigned to a project with them? The score for SWING HIGH, SWING LOW, is pleasant but forgettable. Unfortunately, the movie is centered in the entertainment world, as Fred Macmurray demonstrates great talents as a trumpet player (he even works Carole Lombard into his act by looping his arms around her when he blows his trumpet). The song (sung by Lombard) about how her lover's playing thrills her, is important to the plot. It works in the film, but it would have been better if the song was more memorable.There is a picaresque style to the film - it begins on an ocean liner that Lombard works on, as a manicurist. She is constantly being bullied by her boss Franklin Pangborn (the ship's barber). Then the ship is entering into the Panama Canal, and we see MacMurray as a soldier, who's enlistment is ending shortly. Their first scene together has a nice Leisin touch in it: MacMurray is talking to Lombard, she on the deck of the boat and he on the edge of the wall of the lock. Nice way to keep the action going while the dialog hits a dull bit.The film follows the rise and fall of the Skid Johnson (MacMurray) as he meets Lombard, and begins his reputation as a trumpet player, but meets the \"other woman\" in the film, Dorothy Lamore.

It was a nice, subtle moment. If only his subtlety had been in his acting rather than his moments of diffident humor.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I first came across this film when I read a book (written in the 1970s) about the career of Mitchell Leisin. I have to admit that over the years I have watched many of his films and find his best work really high quality. SWING HIGH, SWING LOW was supposed to be one of his best. While it did not bore me, it did not impress me as much as HOLD BACK THE DAWN, DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY, KITTY, or even GOLDEN EARINGS. I suspect it just dates too much now to be well liked.Working at Paramount Leisin had a problem in those films that he did which were musicals. Most of the scores he worked with were fairly mediocre. It's true that twice standards appeared in his films, but they were really rare cases: \"Cocktales for Two\" appeared in MURDER AT THE VANITIES, and \"Mona Lisa\" came out of CAPTAIN CAREY, U.S.A. But the rest of the score for MURDER AT THE VANITIES was forgettable. \"Mona Lisa\" was the only tune in CAPTAIN CAREY. It shouldn't have been this way - Leisin's studio had Rogers and Hart working for it in the early 1930s. Why couldn't he have been assigned to a project with them? The score for SWING HIGH, SWING LOW, is pleasant but forgettable. Unfortunately, the movie is centered in the entertainment world, as Fred Macmurray demonstrates great talents as a trumpet player (he even works Carole Lombard into his act by looping his arms around her when he blows his trumpet). The song (sung by Lombard) about how her lover's playing thrills her, is important to the plot. It works in the film, but it would have been better if the song was more memorable.There is a picaresque style to the film - it begins on an ocean liner that Lombard works on, as a manicurist. She is constantly being bullied by her boss Franklin Pangborn (the ship's barber). Then the ship is entering into the Panama Canal, and we see MacMurray as a soldier, who's enlistment is ending shortly. Their first scene together has a nice Leisin touch in it: MacMurray is talking to Lombard, she on the deck of the boat and he on the edge of the wall of the lock. Nice way to keep the action going while the dialog hits a dull bit.The film follows the rise and fall of the Skid Johnson (MacMurray) as he meets Lombard, and begins his reputation as a trumpet player, but meets the \"other woman\" in the film, Dorothy Lamore. The best moments in the film deal with the collapse of the relationship with Lombard, and his collapse as a jazz trumpeter (his appearance and need for alcohol is very untypical for a MacMurray character - even his darker figures like Walter Neff or Mr. Sheldrake or the naval officer who pushes the Caine Mutiny did not demonstrate a reliance on alcohol.Lombard is good as the woman loved but wronged by MacMurray.

{"original_text": "Bernardo Bertolucci's \"The Conformist\" (1970) is a captivating and thought-provoking film that explores the themes of conformity, power, and identity. The reason why it excels is due to its intricately crafted narrative, visually stunning cinematography, and an exceptional performance from its lead actor, Jean-Louis Trintignant. Set against the backdrop of fascist Italy, the plot follows Marcello Claudia, a desperate and conflicted man, as he is coerced into an assassination plot. The film delves deep into the complexities of human nature, presenting a protagonist who, despite his deep-seated fears and desires, is willing to conform to the expectations of society, no matter the moral cost. The film's haunting exploration of this theme is both timely and timeless. Furthermore, Bertolucci's direction is masterful. From the meticulously designed sets to the striking use of color and shadow, every frame is a work of art. One scene in particular, the infamous masochistic encounter in a greenhouse, is iconic in its own right, showcasing the director's ability to create a visually stunning and memorably disturbing moment. However, it's Trintignant's portrayal of Marcello that truly brings the film to life. His nuanced and layered performance allows the audience to understand and empathize with a man who, despite all his flaws and misgivings, is fighting to find a place in a world that demands conformity above all else. So, if you're looking for a complex, thought-provoking, and visually stunning film that explores the intricacies of human nature, \"The Conformist\" is a must-watch.

The facility was clean and well-organized, and the overall experience was seamless and worry-free.

This is a little gem of a picture, not least because a resource-depleted future is a reality for us 21st Century citizens. The low-budget opening titles of this movie are great: set to music, a low-tech'tape-slide' sequence composed entirely of archive stills from the dawn of photography right up to 1973, depicts an unspoiled American pastoral developing into a polluted and crowded Hell in less than 2 minutes. Succinct and unambiguous, it's truly memorable. Budget limitations are also behind rather unimaginative cinematography and other constraints, at odds with the story's brilliant premise. The police station sequences are like an episode of some 70's TV detective show, and the other interior sets look basic at best. The budget probably all went on trying to'futurise' the Soylent Executive's'Chelsea West' apartment with state-of-the art goodies, meaning the other costumes are perfunctory, some establishing shots are bizarrely underpopulated and the daytime exteriors seemingly all shot through a smoke filter.The memorable scene where Sol and Thorn (Charlton Heston) share a meal of expensive and rare food neatly summarises their society: They enjoy real bourbon, lettuce, celery, tomato, apple, and beef, and we really sense their lip-smacking appreciation of someone else's wealthy privileges.Robinson's pivotal death scene, in which his character is willingly euthenased at a place called'Home', depicts him immersed in images of the world's once-beautiful flora and fauna as he remembered them, beautifully contrasted with the jaundiced Thorn's dawning realization that the future has been bankrupted, among other horrors.This is one smart film, and its core message is as pertinent today as it was in the early 70s.

Instead, they formed outlaw bands, called \"bushwhackers\", grew they hair long, and sometimes would confiscated Union uniforms which they wore over their regular clothing.The movie depicts their moral dilemma, the high drama of the times, and their supposedly heroic missions of killing storekeepers and farmers who aided the Union.

{"original_text": "For those who like depressing films with sleazy characters and a sordid storyline, this one is for you! From the bleak New York City atmosphere, which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place, to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality, this movie is a real downer. Why it won the Academy Award was because it was so shocking at that time that Hollywood, brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned, wanted to celebrate that fact. Filmmakers then were like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store. So, Hollywood gave theater viewers (for probably the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealing....and then awarded its work. It also hoped, I'm sure, to shock mainstream audiences. Well, it succeeded on that level. Audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the Academy, proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time, couldn't help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbage.Forty years ago, as a very young man, I found this film fascinating, too. However, seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth I never watched to view it again. The acting was good, but so what? Acting is good in many films. Nobody ever said Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight couldn't act. Hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wacked-out people. He was kind of like the Johnny Depp of his era, playing guys like \"Ratso Rizzo\" in this film and then going to be the \"Rain Man\" later on. Yes, \"Ratso\" is a character you'll never forget, and \"Joe Buck\" (Voight) is one you want to forget, but the story is so sordid, it overwhelms the fine acting.This movie isn't \"art,\" and it isn't worthy of its many awards; it only pushed the envelope big-time in 1969 and that's why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics.

From the bleak New York City atmosphere, which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place, to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality, this movie is a real downer. Why it won the Academy Award was because it was so shocking at that time that Hollywood, brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned, wanted to celebrate that fact. Filmmakers then were like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store. So, Hollywood gave theater viewers (for probably the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealing....and then awarded its work. It also hoped, I'm sure, to shock mainstream audiences. Well, it succeeded on that level. Audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the Academy, proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time, couldn't help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbage.Forty years ago, as a very young man, I found this film fascinating, too. However, seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth I never watched to view it again. The acting was good, but so what? Acting is good in many films. Nobody ever said Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight couldn't act. Hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wacked-out people. He was kind of like the Johnny Depp of his era, playing guys like \"Ratso Rizzo\" in this film and then going to be the \"Rain Man\" later on. Yes, \"Ratso\" is a character you'll never forget, and \"Joe Buck\" (Voight) is one you want to forget, but the story is so sordid, it overwhelms the fine acting.This movie isn't \"art,\" and it isn't worthy of its many awards; it only pushed the envelope big-time in 1969 and that's why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics. It's two hours of profanity and ultra-sleazy, religious cheap shots, glorifying weirdos (Andy Warhol even gets in the act - no surprise), and generally despicable people.I did like the catchy song, \"Everybody's Talking'\" that helped make Harry Nilsson famous, but even that was bogus because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better, before Nilsson did it....and few people have ever heard of Neil (which is their loss).

{"original_text": "Title: A Timeless Classic - \"The Color Purple\" Reaffirms Its Relevance \"The Color Purple,\" Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, continues to resonate profoundly with contemporary readers, showcasing an intricate tapestry of womanhood, culture, and transformation. The story, set in rural Georgia during the early 1900s, follows the journey of Celie, a young African American girl subjected to unspeakable hardships and abuse, as she learns to reclaim her identity and discover her inner strength. Walker's evocative prose transports readers into Celie's world, allowing us to experience her pain, her moments of love and connection, and her exhilarating sense of freedom as she emerges from her oppressive circumstances. With unflinching honesty, she explores themes that transcend mere narration - Celie's journey of self-discovery invites reflection on the dynamics of power, freedom, love, and sisterhood. Despite the grim backdrop, hope permeates every page. The novel introduces us to an array of strong, resilient women who embody the power of sisterhood and community in the face of adversity. Their stories intertwine with Celie's, revealing a world where survival and empowerment go hand in hand. \"The Color Purple\" offers more than just a narrative about overcoming adversity; it is a testament to the indomitable human spirit. Each character, flawed yet complex, mirrors real-life experiences, making this timeless tale as relevant today as it was when it was first published over four decades ago.

I've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days.Coming into the 40 Year Old Virgin I knew basically what to expect; I did see the commercials after all; \"is it true that if you don't use it, you lose it?\" What I didn't expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development. There's still the weird \"off-the-wall\" characters that we see so much in Adam Sandler movies and there's still enough inappropriate language to sink Noah's Ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message.The main character Andy is (unfortunately for me) a person I can relate to. In the first shot I see that he even shares my love for Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a poster for the movie on his wall) and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities. Andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology. Andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. Most importantly of all; Andy is a nice person, he doesn't swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them. Combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he's a serial murderer. It's like my life story.The other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way Andy does. I felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since Andy and his girlfriend Trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie.I suppose since I mentioned one flaw I might as well bring the other noticeable one to light. The story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go; it's quite simple. It deals with Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what's going to happen in the end. Sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know what's going to happen in the end, and I assure you it does. These are definitely small stains on the movie but there's so much good here that I can easily ignore it's few faults.When I say \"good\" I mean \"bad\" of course. This is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad. For the most part I think it succeeded. There are so many hilarious scenes such as Andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or the scene where Andy goes with his Trish's daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else. Ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence \"Ooh! Como se llama!\" An interesting little note about that scene; the actor Steve Carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real. Of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part.Actually since we're talking about Steve Carell, I'd like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since I didn't even know who he was prior to seeing this film. I was just so impressed by his writing, acting and timing that I now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles. This man has talent it The 40 Year Old Virgin proves that.To be honest I had doubts about this film but early word was positive and I knew it was something I was eventually going to see. I'm glad that I did too since it's probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching.

This is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad. For the most part I think it succeeded. There are so many hilarious scenes such as Andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or the scene where Andy goes with his Trish's daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else. Ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence \"Ooh! Como se llama!\" An interesting little note about that scene; the actor Steve Carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real. Of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part.Actually since we're talking about Steve Carell, I'd like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since I didn't even know who he was prior to seeing this film. I was just so impressed by his writing, acting and timing that I now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles. This man has talent it The 40 Year Old Virgin proves that.To be honest I had doubts about this film but early word was positive and I knew it was something I was eventually going to see. I'm glad that I did too since it's probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching. It's not simply a series of sex gags lumped together rather it's a series of sex gags entwined with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance."}

Not many tables available; and, the open tables were not clean. Red flag for me. I cleaned our table of choice and held back my opinion about it. Later our order taker cleaned off the rest of the tables, and did a mediocre job of sweeping the floors. Not bad, but enough to make you ask yourself how well they manage their crew. Okay, on with the food. They called out our order and the Quesadillas came out piping hot. We had to wait a few minutes to eat them. Each 12\" Quesadilla was served on a tray lined with foil. A handful of lettuce graced the presence of the correlating international sauce (eg. Italian, Greek, Mexican), served in a small cup. Tzatkiki, for example, with the Greek. I opened the Greek and it was steaming hot with gooey cheese, black olives, and banana pepper. I added lettuce for more depth. The flavors were mild, but tasty. Nothing that really wowed me or that I could not make at home. I ate half and took the rest home.

{"original_text": "I haven't yet read Kurt Vonnegut's Mother Night (though I've read other books of his, all outstanding pieces of satire and game-changing novel pieces). After seeing Keith Gordon's film adaptation of his book, it will be an immediate must-read in the near future. It's the kind of material that I'm sure if it wasn't made in 1995/96 as a film, it would be picked up right away today in the time period when many period post/present-Holocaust/WW2 movies are quite popular. Except that this is much darker, though even more resonant, about the nature of playing roles and the real underlying horror of living with life after war than say The Reader. It's about the very real danger of pretending in wartime, which is what being a spy in WW2 is really all about.It would be one thing if Mother Night had a script with a lot of emotional depth and complexity about the moral choice and constant role- even after the war ends- for Howard W. Cambpell (Nick Nolte), which is does. But it's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique. Keith Gordon is not someone I usually think of as a director of really strong material (more-so I think back to him as an actor, oddly enough featured briefly with Vonnegut himself in Back to School), but this is a revelation. He takes the story of Campbell as a story of a fractured life: a German propaganda master (the \"only American left in Berlin\"), who is actually a spy for the Americans but can never have his identity revealed, and was before a playwright who really belonged to \"a nation of two\", himself and his wife (Sheryl Lee). It follows him from his prison cell, awaiting trial in Israel in 1961, as he writes his memoir and tells of his disillusionment about being a'pretend' Nazi, and then in 1960 in semi-hiding in a New York apartment, which is where the bulk of the film takes place.Mother Night can be quite heavy, like on a level one might associate with the Pianist, but on another more emotional-cerebral level than the stark poetry of that film. Gordon, by way of Vonnegut, is trying to give us a strong look at a man who has nothing, except the memory (and then later a weird transposition) of his long lost love in a \"sister\" who has come back to him in NYC, so he's left to his own devices when he befriends a painter (Alan Arkin, very very good here), and then is found out as a Nazi-in-hiding by a white supremacist newsletter, leading wackos to his apartment. On the surface this should be just a straightforward spy story, but not a thing is straightforward. The'something' of this man's life is staggering, but it's ultimately of his own choosing. Campbell is one of those characters that could be analyzed for hours on end, but the same conclusions might be reached (and, in a way, mirrors the line Goebbels said): the bigger the lie, the more people believe it. That is except for the select few who started the lie and know its secret and power.But oh, it would be one thing if it were just a wonderful and tragic-comic tale, or another if it were featuring some really fantastic performances (which is does: Nolte is at his very best here, and Sheryl Lee, who we might remember from Twin Peaks as Laura Palmer, stuns in multiple roles, especially in the scene when she reveals she's not'really' Helga). It's also a gorgeously shot film, with brilliant lighting and shots that reflect the state of mind of the character, or just the starkness or sickening colors of the time (watch the scene where an old Campbell watches a film of his younger self spouting out a rant, the juxtaposition of faces is great). And the music selections rise the level of tragedy. It could be argued some of the music is too much, but at other times it elevates the material past its own usual dramatic dimensions and makes it operatic, solemn about human nature.It's not always an easy film to take emotionally, and some of the twists do have that tinge of \"whoa\" as in any spy story. But it's the subversion from Vonnegut that sticks through, the way of taking appearance and performance, of life imitating art imitating life imitating death, and making it into something worth remembering. I have no idea just yet if the book is better than the film (or the other way around), but at the moment it's hard for me not to recommend this to anyone looking for a masterpiece of post WW2/holocaust storytelling.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I haven't yet read Kurt Vonnegut's Mother Night (though I've read other books of his, all outstanding pieces of satire and game-changing novel pieces).

The plot, although slightly intriguing with the concept of having two brains, did not live up to the comedic potential.

The pacing was off, the jokes felt forced at times, and the storyline was predictable. However, there were a few moments that made me chuckle, so it was not a complete waste of time.

{"original_text": "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call.

None of them in particular stick out, with exception of \"Let's Make Music Together\" and \"Love Survives\", and Burt Reynolds can't sing and Dom DeLuise has done much better singing. All in all, a watchable movie, that could have been more, but is definitely memorable, and I would definitely watch it again. 7/10."}

{"original_text": "Title: Lifeforce (1985) - A Cosmic Rollercoaster Ride of Terror and Sensuality From the mind of famed director Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), comes a film that defies categorization: Lifeforce. This 1985 sci-fi horror classic grips you from its opening scenes and refuses to let go, hurling you on a wild cosmic rollercoaster ride of terror and sensuality. Our story begins when a spaceship containing three strange beings crashes near Earth. Astronauts, led by Colonel Tom Carlsen (Steve Railsback), are sent to investigate these extraterrestrial visitors. But their curiosity quickly turns to terror as they discover the beings are not peaceful explorers, but rather, energy-sucking vampires from the Dark Side of the Moon. With London under attack, the astronauts team up with psychic Helena Marsh (Matilda May) and a group of military personnel to stop this otherworldly menace before it drains Earth of all energy. The special effects, by masterminds such as David Allen, conjure up a vivid and eerie vision of the cosmos. Hooper's masterful direction and the ensemble cast's captivating performances lead to a thrilling narrative filled with suspense, action, and a dash of eroticism. Lifeforce is not for the faint of heart, pushing the boundaries of what was acceptable in a mainstream film at the time. In many ways, it's a dark mirror of our society, reflecting our fascination with the unknown and our most primal fears. A true cult classic, Lifeforce continues to captivate audiences today.

The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but even these were fascinating.

Everyone was beyond gracious and accommodating. I have zero complaints about the staff. They would obviously go out of their way to help anyone. Every bartender, every catering staffer, every hotel desk person, all of them, were SO customer-service oriented. Excellent all around in this area. The hotel rooms (standard room, paid $99 a night for a Fri. and Sat. in early August) look nice now because they are relatively new but I am not sure they will hold up over time. Very spacious for such a low price and the views are great. However, the room walls are paper-thin. I mean PAPER!!

My neighbors also had a baby that cried for over 3 hours one day which made napping impossible. I have never heard so much through a hotel room wall before. This is a definite problem and I suspect they hear a lot about it from patrons. Another review mentioned that the room lighting is bad. This is true. It was nearly impossible to put on makeup even though they had a nice magnification mirror in the bathroom. I tried every spot and couldnt find a place with lighting. I ended up sitting by the window because it was still daylight and holding up my tiny compact on the couch. This is a small but highly frustrating thing for a woman. The shower and bathrooms are very nice in the rooms. High quality and the water was warm. I really liked the bathroom. So clean, too! The TVs are pretty neat because you can check-out on them. The free wi-fi was spotty and made me login again on their page over and over. The AV in the meeting rooms was cruddy. The mics went in and out and had a lot of interference. However the system is built-in rather than set up like most AV places, so I guess you get what you pay for. The art in all the conference rooms was gorgeous but it was so cold in all of them that I left my meeting to go defrost. I am not an \"always cold\" person -- lots of other people were frosty too. Conference room catering was good for the most part. Some things were high quality and delicious, others felt and tasted very mediocre chain-like. Hit and miss.

The shower and bathrooms are very nice in the rooms. High quality and the water was warm. I really liked the bathroom. So clean, too! The TVs are pretty neat because you can check-out on them. The free wi-fi was spotty and made me login again on their page over and over. The AV in the meeting rooms was cruddy. The mics went in and out and had a lot of interference. However the system is built-in rather than set up like most AV places, so I guess you get what you pay for. The art in all the conference rooms was gorgeous but it was so cold in all of them that I left my meeting to go defrost. I am not an \"always cold\" person -- lots of other people were frosty too. Conference room catering was good for the most part. Some things were high quality and delicious, others felt and tasted very mediocre chain-like. Hit and miss. The pool was always crowded with families. Not a relaxing environment at all. Spa service menu was very reasonably priced but not a lot of options. No deep tissue massage?! I would go back. I want to try the steakhouse."}

The artichoke spinach dip was yummy too, but it was the chips that added the right touch. The hubby loved the calamari. To top it all off we received a loyalty card!

{"original_text": "Title: Zombie 3 (1988) Directors: Mostly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin Review: To review this flick and get some good background of it, I gotta start by the beginning. And the beginning of this is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn came out in 79, Lucio Fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it Zombie 2. That film is the one we know as plain ole Zombie. You know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark! OK so, after that flick (named Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and made a huge chunk of cash, the Italians decided, heck. Lets make some more zombie flicks! These things are raking in the dough! So Zombie 3 was born. Confused yet? The story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we've seen in a lot of American zombie flicks that we have seen before this one, the best comparison that comes to mind is Return of the Living Dead. Lets see...there's the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. Canister gets released into the general population and shebang! We get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh. A bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel. They gotta fight the zombies to survive.There was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie. First and foremost, Lucio Fulci the beloved godfather of gore from Italy was sick. So he couldn't really finish this film the way that he wanted to. The film was then handed down to two lesser directors Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good. You see Fulci himself didn't really have his heart and soul on this flick. He was disenchanted with it. He gave the flick over to the producers and basically said: \"Do whatever the hell you want with it!\" And god love them, they did.And that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great Fulci credited as its \"director\". The main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore! There's no substance to it whatsoever! After the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it, the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies. Now in some cases this can prove to be fun, if #1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and #2 there's a lot of gore and guts involved.Here we get neither! Well there's some inspired moments in there, like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people. That was cool. There's also a scene involving a flying zombie head (wich by the way defies all logic and explanation) and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs. But aside from that...the rest of the flick just falls flat on its ass.Endless upon endless scenes that don't do jack to move the already non existent plot along. That was my main gripe with this flick. The sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non-existent. I hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished! I like my b-movies, but this one just really went even below that! Its closer to a z-level flick, if you ask me.The zombie make up? Pure crap. The zombies are all Asian actors (the movie was filmed in the Philippines) so you get a bunch of Asian looking zombies. But thats not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway. Its the look of the zombies that really sucks! They all died with the same clothes on for some reason. And what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up (more like smudges) on their faces. One or two zombies had slightly more complex make up, but it still wasn't good enough to impress. Its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces. So not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap. These are supposed to be dead folks! Anyhows, for those expecting the usual coolness in a Fulci flick don't come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody else's flick. And those two involved (Mattei and Fragasso) didn't really put there heart and souls into it. In fact, when you see the extras on the DVD you will see that when Fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick, he doesn't even take it to seriously. You can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they \"just had a job to do and they did it\". And that my friends, is the last nail on this flick. There's no love, and no heart put into making this film. Therefore you get a half assed, crappy zombie flick.Only for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Title: Zombie 3 (1988) Directors: Mostly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin Review: To review this flick and get some good background of it, I gotta start by the beginning.

That was my main gripe with this flick. The sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non-existent. I hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished! I like my b-movies, but this one just really went even below that! Its closer to a z-level flick, if you ask me.The zombie make up? Pure crap. The zombies are all Asian actors (the movie was filmed in the Philippines) so you get a bunch of Asian looking zombies. But thats not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway. Its the look of the zombies that really sucks! They all died with the same clothes on for some reason. And what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up (more like smudges) on their faces. One or two zombies had slightly more complex make up, but it still wasn't good enough to impress. Its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces. So not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap. These are supposed to be dead folks! Anyhows, for those expecting the usual coolness in a Fulci flick don't come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody else's flick. And those two involved (Mattei and Fragasso) didn't really put there heart and souls into it. In fact, when you see the extras on the DVD you will see that when Fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick, he doesn't even take it to seriously. You can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they \"just had a job to do and they did it\". And that my friends, is the last nail on this flick. There's no love, and no heart put into making this film. Therefore you get a half assed, crappy zombie flick.Only for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made."}

It's not as atmospheric and gripping as Full Metal Jacket, not as epic as Band of Brothers, not as action packed as...well, anything.

{"original_text": "The vibe of this place is hip, urban and chill. Definitely a cool place to meet up with friends. It's very pricey but the foods are tasty, different and beautifully presented. My all time favorite dish so far has been the griddled mushrooms! These are so freaking delicious! If you love mushrooms, definitely try this! My friends and I ordered four servings ($8 per small plate) in one sitting. We'd share one small plate, then decide...just one more. There's a poached egg served on top. I recommend poking the egg and letting the yolk coat the mushrooms. Trust me. The mushrooms are cooked to perfection. There's just a bit of a crunch when you bite. Not too soft that can eat them without chewing. Honestly, these mushrooms taste like heaven in your mouth! I also liked the popcorn chicken ($9 for bowl of about 10-12). At first glance, these look like donut holes. But in a way, they also remind me of the chicken balls, you might find in a Chinese food buffet. The outside is crunchy and dusted with popcorn. The round ball of chicken inside is soft. At times, I found the section between the outer crunchy part and just around the chicken, a bit doughy. It would also be nice if there was some sort of sauce to dip these into, for extra flavor. My friends and I ordered a total of three bowls. I definitely recommend sharing. After eating three chicken balls, I personally had my fill. Another beautifully presented and tasty dish, is the crunch salad for $13. This dish looks like a tower of fancy shredded coleslaw. It's made with raw, pickled and fried veggies. When brought to your table, the servers pour the house made dressing, around and on top of this tower. All the while, you're thinking, WOW. Fancy! It's so pretty, you kind of feel bad tearing it down to eat it. Good thing it tastes as good as it looks! It tastes fresh and has just the right amount of dressing. We had two orders of this salad. Last but not least, we had the potato and squash gnocchi for $25. Ironically, the most expensive dish we ordered, was the biggest disappointment. I generally love eating duck. However, one taste of the gnocchi made me turned off by this dish. Hard to explain exactly why. My friend described it as \"too strong of a taste.\" You know how lamb has a distinct taste? Well this dish had a strong taste, but unfortunately, in my opinion, not a good tasting one. The weird thing was, my other friend, who is generally more picky with food, actually ate all the duck meat. He also said he also liked the taste of the broth. In the end, the only thing left in the bowl was the gnocchi. It just had too much of that \"too strong taste\" infused into it.

Several long time friends of mine from the Broad Ripple area all told me to try this new place out. 1) You took over the Chumley's location which used to have 50? taps. Now you have 24. You are a taproom in Broad Ripple and in the IBJ article you talk about how your selection of beers is going to be different. I saw maybe 2 beers that were slightly unique. 2) My dinner date and I ordered a Mule each. Very good! 3) She ordered your Chorizo Mac-n-cheese. Flavor was good. But honestly, it looked like hamburger helper. 4) I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. It was unevenly cooked. One end was dry and chewy. The other end I had to double check to make sure it wasn't raw - it had that odd crunchy feel of undercooked chicken 5) the house fries are a sliced potato that is deep fried. just meh. some way overcooked and some chewy. 6) PLEASE get rid of the generic ketchup/condiments. At a minimum go with Red Gold - a local company.

The other end I had to double check to make sure it wasn't raw - it had that odd crunchy feel of undercooked chicken 5) the house fries are a sliced potato that is deep fried. just meh. some way overcooked and some chewy. 6) PLEASE get rid of the generic ketchup/condiments.

{"original_text": "Title: A Hauntingly Beautiful Tale of Obsession - \"Eyes Without a Face\" \"Eyes Without a Face\" is a mesmerizing Journey into the depths of human obsession and the lengths one will go to restore beauty. Georges Franju's 1960 masterpiece is a chilling exploration of the human condition, wrapped inside a gothic, visually stunning package. Christine, portrayed by the captivating Edith Scob, is a young woman with a tragic past. Scarred by an accident, she is left with a disfigured face, hidden from the world. Her devoted father, Dr. G\u00e9nessier, stops at nothing to give her back her youthful appearance. He captures beautiful young women, performing gruesome surgeries to graft their eyes onto his daughter's lifeless sockets. The cinematography is a visual treat, with the dark, misty settings creating an eerie atmosphere while the stark hospital interiors add to the sense of dread. The score by Maurice Jarre is hauntingly beautiful, setting the tone for this disturbing tale. Edith Scob delivers a remarkable performance as Christine. Her portrayal of a woman trapped between the reality of her disfigurement and the longing for a normal life is heart-wrenching. The supporting cast, led by Pierre Clairet as the obsessed father, also delivers solid performances. Despite its disturbing subject matter, \"Eyes Without a Face\" is more than just a horror movie. It's a thought-provoking allegory on vanity, obsession, and the consequences of one's actions. It leaves a lasting impression, making it a must-watch classic for any cinephile.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "\"Eyes Without a Face\" is a haunting tale of obsession and the lengths one will go to restore beauty, starring Edith Scob, Pierre Clairet, and Maurice Jarre, directed by Georges Franju, and released in the US on DVD, Blu-ray, and digitally on 24 March 2016...

Here's a possible continuation: I'm assuming you're referring to the 1965 Western comedy film \"Cat Ballou,\" and you found it unpleasant for some reasons that may include the following: 1. The humor: The film's brand of slapstick humor and cartoonish violence may not have appealed to some viewers, as they found it difficult to find the comedy in the violent situations portrayed in the film. 2. The pacing: Some viewers might have found the film's pacing uneven, with the plot moving too slowly at times and other moments feeling rushed. 3. The acting: While Lee Marvin's performance as the grumpy and drunken gunman \"King\" Ballou was widely praised, some critics and audiences felt that Jane Fonda, who played the titular character, was miscast or lacked chemistry with her co-stars. 4. The tone: The mixture of comedy and more serious themes, such as revenge and redemption, might not have worked for everyone, leaving some viewers feeling that the film was inconsistent or tonally inconsistent. 5. The political correctness: Some modern viewers might find the film's portrayal of Native Americans or other marginalized groups offensive, as the film employs racial stereotypes that were common in Hollywood at the time but are now considered insensitive or inappropriate. Ultimately, it's important to remember that people's reactions to movies can be subjective, and what one person finds unpleasant or disappointing, another might find entertaining or delightful.

Halloween II, directed by Rob Zombie, takes us back to the haunting world of Michael Myers, the relentless Boogeyman with an insatiable thirst for blood. This sequel, unlike its predecessor, dives straight into the eerie ambiance. The opening sequence is a chilling reminder of the terror that lies in wait, setting the tone for the rest of the film. The cinematography is meticulously crafted, using shadows and darkness to create an unsettling atmosphere. Every jump scare is masterfully executed, leaving you on the edge of your seat. The performances are commendable, with Malcolm McDowell delivering an exceptional portrayal of Doctor Loomis. His fear and desperation are palpable, making the audience feel the urgency of stopping Michael. The chemistry between him and Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Combs) is undeniable, adding depth to their relationship and the storyline. Zombie manages to infuse a sense of unpredictability into the narrative, keeping us guessing until the very end. His signature gritty style adds a modern twist to the timeless tale, yet retains the original's essence. The gore factor is definitely amped up, providing thrilling and gruesome moments that will leave horror enthusiasts satisfied. In conclusion, Halloween II is a thrilling and gore-filled continuation of the original. It masterfully combines elements of suspense, terror, and drama, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre.

Needless to say, after about 15 minutes I found myself thoroughly engaged and very pleasantly surprised.An experimental oil well has penetrated about six miles into the earth and is being shut down by the sponsor. Lois and Clark show up to get the scoop but are disappointed that the deepest well ever drilled will no longer be in operation. A day later, strange events at the well make for a story more appropriate for Superman than Clark Kent. It seems that the radioactive Mole Men have invaded from their six-mile deep home near the earth's core.Supermen and the Mole Men is a simplistic but well-made piece of social realism. Released in 1951, starring a lead actor who served in World War II, the moral of the story seems to be that Americans are just as capable of becoming fascists as anybody else. To drive this point home in a typically straightforward Superman manner, Reeves even accuses the lynch mob hunting the Mole Men of being'Nazis' at one point.Even in the 1950s, the science underlying this film was nonexistent. Six miles of drilling through continental crust would not have even penetrated the upper mantle, let alone the \"hollow center of the earth\" - which, in any case does not exist. Forgivable - keep in mind that this film is based on a golden age comic book.The film is a little unevenly paced. Although the Molemen are interesting, a bit creepy, and nicely portrayed, there are several Corman-esquire scenes which spend too much time redundantly showing us their odd behavior. The script is intelligent and economical. By today's standards, the costuming is poor to fair, but for its time, this film's special effects and costuming were quite good. The cinematography is also generally very good, and the acting is much better than one might expect.

About 30 minutes into the movie, my friends started asking me to turn it off. Around 45 minutes they begged me.

{"original_text": "I'm sorry to hear that you had an unpleasant experience at Texas Margaritas. I'd be happy to help you complete your review. From the moment I entered the restaurant, I was met with a less-than-welcoming atmosphere. The decor was outdated and the tables were sticky, giving off a sense of neglect. The service was also subpar. Our server was distracted and seemed rushed, failing to check on us regularly or even remember our orders at times. As for the food, unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. The tacos were dry and lacking in flavor, and the guacamole was overly salted. However, the star of the menu, the margaritas, were the saving grace. They were freshly made with a good balance of sweet and sour, but that wasn't enough to make up for the overall disappointment. In summary, my experience at Texas Margaritas left me feeling underwhelmed. The negative atmosphere, subpar service, and mediocre food did not meet my expectations for a Mexican restaurant. I hope that the management recognizes the areas that need improvement and makes the necessary changes to create a more enjoyable dining experience for their customers.

I go here not when I'm in the mood for something healthy (though the Paleo Bowl would fulfill that if you are looking for something healthy) I go here when I went delicious bar food. If you like regular nachos, the kind with real melted cheese (not fake cheese sauce), these are some of the best you can get. They're nothing crazy, no unique twist, just damn good nachos. If you want fancier nachos, try elsewhere. But here is going to be one of your best options for straight up regular delicious nachos. The half portion is more than sufficient for one person. I cannot even imagine trying to tackle the full portion. I'm a vegetarian so I never get it with beef, but you can totally add a meat option should you wish. Also delicious is their mac and cheese. It's so cheesy, never dried out, and always has some nice cheese melted right on top. You can get it as a side with many of their burgers, or you can order the entr\u00e9e sized. And in my opinion, you can never go wrong by adding green chiles to the mac and cheese. Because green chilis are a gift. I love their caprese appetizer as well. Standard mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic. But it's always tasty. Same with the mozzarella sticks. Their white bean hummus plate is also delicious. The other thing I love about trident is they do what, in my opinion, all restaurants with burgers should do, they say at the top you can take any burger and substitute a veggie patty. It's baffling to me how many places don't even offer a veggie burger at all (they're frozen! not that hard to keep them stocked!) or if they do, they're hesitant or unwilling to accommodate a request to add it to a different burger than the one veggie burger listed on the menu. Why in the world, if you already have veggie patties on hand, do I have to order the ONE veggie burger you have listed? Why can't I just substitute the veggie patty onto any other option? It drives me bonkers. But for Trident, this is never the case! The mushroom swiss looks good to you? They'll make it with a veggie patty. The green chile burger looks great? They'll make it a veggie. Etc., etc., etc. It's a standard Boca Burger, which are ok. Normally I avoid Boca Burgers, but Trident makes me excited to eat a veggie burger! I recommend the Green Chile with a Boca Burger, and add a fried egg. Side salad and no bun if you want low carb. Or, if you're indulging, side of mac & cheese. For non-vegetarians, my friends are always happy to eat here too. Popular choices among my friends include the grilled shrimp skewers, the non-veggie burgers, the crispy shrimp po-boy, and the paleo bowl. They also have a fully stocked bar.

Upon return, just park in any spot and bring your keys back to the rental counter (back into the building, up the escalator, across the overpass, down the escalator, across the length of the station) to return the keys. Don't expect a verbal confirmation of your total, don't expect a smile or someone wishing you a good day. Just walk away vowing to take a cab the next time."}
{"original_text": "This delectable fusion of New Age babble and luridly bad film-making may not \"open\" you up, to borrow one of the film's favorite verbs, but it might leave your jaw slack and your belly sore from laughter or retching. Based on the best-selling book by James Redfield, first (self) published in 1993, this cornucopia of kitsch tracks the spiritual awakening of an American history teacher (Matthew Settle) who, on traveling to deepest, darkest, phoniest Peru and sniffing either the air or something else more illegal. Namely what he discovers is a schlock Shangri La populated by smiling zombies who may be nuts or just heavily medicated, perhaps because they're often accompanied by a panpipe flourish and an occasional shout out from a celestial choir. Although there's a lot of talk about \"energy,\" that quality is decidedly missing from the motley cast whose numbers include Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, all of whom are now firmly ensconced in the camp pantheon. For those who care, the plot involves the military, terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni provided the inept direction while Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the hoot of a script. In short, easily the worst film seen in 40+ years of viewing movies.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This delectable fusion of New Age babble and luridly bad film-making may not \"open\" you up, to borrow one of the film's favorite verbs, but it might leave your jaw slack and your belly sore from laughter or retching.

The big issue I had is when the check was delivered there was an \"ACA Surcharge?\" In case you were wondering what this is, as I did, it's a surcharge the restaurant is sneaking onto the check to cover their expenses for the Affordable Care Act, i.e., Obamacare! Sorry, but I pay almost $400 a month for health insurance already for me and my child and I don't want to pay for others. I did request to take it off which took an additional 30 minutes!

We were not warned ahead of time and when I asked to see the menu the manager just said he'd take it off the check. We will not be returning.

{"original_text": "If the name of my restaurant was my last name I'd make dam sure it was good! Well Charles LaScala shouldn't worry because this is a very good mid-level Italian restaurant. I've been to dinner, lunch, and happy hour here all multiple times so I know my way around this place. Before I discuss the many great things about this establishment I'll mention two issues that are less than good. First this place has an active bar with multiple TVs. This is great for Happy Hour but not so great if you are seated near it with the intention of having a peaceful meal. So Rule #1 is to ask to be seated away from the bar. I've never found this to be a problem as the staff is very accommodating. Second, in my opinion, the adult libations are generally a dollar or two too high for a mid-level Italian place. It's very easy to order drinks here that go over $10. So consider yourself forewarned. So let's talk about all the positive attributes- The location is fabulous. It's within walking distance of Olde City, the Walnut Street Theater, the Historic District, etc., etc. The have a few outside tables and Chestnut Street is great for people watching. These folks have one of the best free parking arrangements in all of Philadelphia. That's right, I said free and the parking lot is in the same building. If you are driving in it doesn't get any better than this. Note that free parking is available after 3 PM. They use OpenTable so making your reservation is super convenient. By the way, these folks do a great job during Restaurant Weeks. Make yourself a note to book early for those coveted RW seatings. Regarding the food; expect classic Italian in large portions. It doesn't matter if you are a carnivore, like your protein from the sea, or are of the vegetarian persuasion. Everybody will be happy here. Expect appetizers to be about $10 and entr\u00e9es to range from the high teens to mid-twenties. The Broccoli Rabe appetizer ($10) is to die for. It comes with sweet Italian sausage and grilled polenta. The lovely wife has tried the Chicken Alla Roma ($21) and pronounced it excellent. It comes with mushrooms and asparagus in a lemon-caper sauce. If you are in this part of town, give them a try for lunch.

It tells the riotous tale of two socially awkward, yet intellectually accomplished men, Lewis Skolnick (Robert Carradine) and GilbertLowell (Anthony Edwards), who, after being mercilessly ridiculed at their new university, decide to start a fraternity for the intellectual elite, \"Alpha Beta.\" The story is filled with clich\u00e9d yet enduring slapstick comedy antics interspersed with moments of genuine pathos and camaraderie. Through a series of hilarious mishaps, the nerds manage to outwit the popular fraternity, Alpha Alpha Alpha, led by the snobbish and arrogant Ollie Trainer (Anthony Edwards in a dual role). Revenge of the Nerds showcases a charming innocence and charm, as it explores the age-old theme of acceptance and the triumph of the underdog. The film's witty dialogues, outlandish physical comedy, and satirical take on Greek life continue to entertain audiences even today. However, the movie is not without its flaws. The portrayal of women and the use of derogatory language towards them feel outdated and inappropriate by today's standards. Yet, one cannot deny that Revenge of the Nerds is a timeless piece of cinema that continues to elicit nostalgia and laughter in equal measure. Despite its imperfections, Revenge of the Nerds remains a classic comedy that should be embraced for its unabashed silliness, heartwarming underdog narrative, and enduring nostalgia.

{"original_text": "Released as Zentropa in North America to avoid confusion with Agniezska Holland's own Holocaust film Europa Europa, this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise, inspire or downright shock is a bizarre, nostalgic, elaborate film about a naive American in Germany shortly following the end of WWII. The American, named Leo, doesn't fully get what he's doing there. He has come to take part in fixing up the country since, in his mind, it's about time Germany was shown some charity. No matter how that sounds, he is not a Nazi sympathizer or so much as especially pro-German, merely mixed up. His uncle, who works on the railroad, gets Leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car, and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 Germany's horrors and enigmas.This progression starts when Leo, played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor Jean-Marc Barr, meets a sultry heiress on the train played by Barbara Sukowa, an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor. She seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family, which owns the company which manufactures the trains. These were the precise trains that took Jews to their deaths during the war, but now they run a drab day-to-day timetable, and the woman's Uncle Kessler postures as another one of those good Germans who were just doing their jobs. There is also Udo Kier, the tremendous actor who blew me away in Von Trier's shocking second film Epidemic, though here he is mere scenery.Another guest at the house is Eddie Constantine, an actor with a quiet strength, playing a somber American intelligence man. He can confirm that Uncle Kessler was a war criminal, though it is all completely baffling to Leo. Americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades, but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than Leo, who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death train.The story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film's Danish director, Lars Von Trier, whose anchor is in the film's breathtaking editing and cinematography. He shoots in black and white and color, he uses double-exposures, optical effects and trick photography, having actors interact with rear-projected footage, he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects, caught between glass for our more precise survey.This Grand Jury Prize-winning surrealist work is allegorical, but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer. I interpret it as a film about the last legs of Nazism, symbolized by the train, and the ethical accountability of Americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads. During the time frame of the movie, and the Nazi state, and such significance to the train, are dead, but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexes.The characters, music, dialogue, and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions. The most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones. Two trains halting back and forth, Barr on one and Sukowa on another. An underwater shot of proliferating blood. An uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown. And most metaphysically affecting of all, an anesthetic shot of train tracks, as Max von Sydow's voice allures us to hark back to Europe with him, and abandon our personal restraint.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Released as Zentropa in North America to avoid confusion with Agniezska Holland's own Holocaust film Europa Europa, this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise, inspire or downright shock is a bizarre, nostalgic, elaborate film about a naive American in Germany shortly following the end of WWII.

{"original_text": "Title: Masculin F\u00e9minin: A Tender and Provocative Exploration of Love and Identity In Jean-Luc Godard's Masculin F\u00e9minin (1966), the renowned French New Wave filmmaker unravels the complexities of love, identity, and societal expectations through the intertwined lives of seven Parisian young adults. A masterclass in visual storytelling and intellectual provocations, Masculin F\u00e9minin is an essential addition to any cinephile's collection and a testament to Godard's unwavering brilliance. The story follows Paul, a philosophy professor, and his lover Madeleine, an aspiring actress, as they navigate romantic relationships and personal dilemmas with a diverse group of friends, among them Florence, a sexually liberated woman, and Raoul, a factory worker. Godard's innovative techniques, such as overlapping dialogue and fragmented narratives, seamlessly weave these characters' stories together, highlighting the interconnected nature of their experiences and their underlying universal themes. With its stunning black-and-white cinematography and playful use of sound and image, Masculin F\u00e9minin is a visually stunning and intellectually stimulating exploration of love, identity, and the role of art in society. Godard's nuanced portrayal of relationships and societal expectations transcends the boundaries of a conventional narrative and invites the viewer to delve deeper into the film's profound questions and insights. An unforgettable cinematic experience, Masculin F\u00e9minin is not only a landmark of the French New Wave but a timeless exploration of human emotions and experiences.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Jean-Luc Godard's landmark film Masculin F\u00e9minin will be released on Blu-ray and DVD by Criterion in the UK and Ireland on 17 February 2018... and on 1 March 2019 in the US and Canada on 4K Ultra HD and HDR (high dynamic range) digital release by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, in association with the BFI London Film Festival, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the film's world premiere at the Venice Film Festival in 1964...and on the eve of the festival's 70th anniversary, on 5 February 2019 in London, England... and on 10 March 2019 at the Toronto International Film Festival."}

{"original_text": "After hearing the word of mouth of just how bad this film is I took the plunge and bought the DVD. That said everything previously mentioned about this film is true. For a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all. The list of problems with the film could drag on forever. Chief amongst them is the film is simply too long. It dragged on for a few minutes short of 3 hours. Nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly. Secondly, as many had pointed out from the \"trailers\", the special effects are anything but special. The tripods looked OK in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was grade-Z 1970's or 1980's quality. Probably the worst effects of all were the horses, which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved. The heat ray effects were laughable, as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles. Also pitiful was the Thunderchild sequence, in which the Thunderchild, described in the book as an ironclad ram, looked nothing of the sort. Instead it resembled a World War 1 era destroyer, complete with deck guns (which fired but had no visible crew), and torpedo tubes. The colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects. Most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out Mars to her in the sky. Well, the sky is black, but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight. There is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape, bathed in full sunlight, and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars. To detract even further, the color of the scenes made no sense. In some they are bathed in orange light. In others green light. In still others it's blue light. In some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue. The frame-rate and camera is very shaky, giving everything a stuttering look.Finally, the acting is overall sub-par. One man portrays two characters who's sole difference was one lacked a mustache. This led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were. The English accents, even to American ears, are outrageous. In summary, this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times. I have not seen Gigli or some of the other recent flops but this one, because of it's poor quality in every respect, must easily be worse then anything that mainstream Hollywood has put out.

Everyone at the table enjoyed them. For my meal, I ordered the Block Burger with no bun, and was able to add a half salad instead of the fries. There's an upcharge of $3 to do this, but the salad is large! And it's only the half sized version! You chose between the Block salad or the Beet and Apple salad. I chose the Block which is almost like a Cobb salad. It was so fresh and tasty! The burger was cooked to perfection and exactly what I wanted. The staff were attentive, friendly, and personable. The restaurant itself was clean and the decor was nice. I would definitely visit again!"}

Shakespeare would be no more than UNINTELLIGIBLE without me pouring ALL my concentration into his almost encrypted plays.... encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language..... and then I still wouldn't get most of it.Second, it was 4 hours long! I never thought that could be a good thing.Well let me tell you something. This movie was so masterful, so beautiful, I actually understood all the language as it was being performed. Now, the script was followed to the letter in this movie, the same script that was incomprehensible to me in Shakespeare class. And here I was my mind opening and me understanding it. I was doubting myself while watching the movie almost! But lo and behold.... when performed, and only then, Shakespeare comes to life. So this version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare is indeed a master, who wrote great stories. When I saw it on the big screen, especially in the high budget major motion picture style (with beautiful cinematography and photography), and acted amazingly by Brannagh and cast, somehow..... I understood what was going on. What was being said. The language is awesome and passionate. It allows for more raw emotion.... when words can't describe something, maybe Shakespeare's words can.I still hold to this day that Fist of The North Star (animated, english dub) is the greatest movie ever made. No movie provides more sheer entertainment. But for a movie to come close to dethroning Fist from that position (which Hamlet did -- it came close) is truly amazing..... awe inspiring. It wasn't a movie. It was an event.Even more amazing, it made me appreciate shakespeare. Wow. Powerful. Powerful is the word. One of the rare, TRULY powerful movies out there.This gets 2 hundred trillion stars out of infinity stars. Yes yes.By the way, all you kids out there in a Shakespeare class.... forget it.

{"original_text": "I was on my way to Pho & Beyond with my mom when I was like, \"Hey do you want to try'La Fusion' instead?\" So we gave it a shot. I gave it a 4 star for one reason: Crispy Duck. It was phenomenal. I asked for both sauces (thai curry / raspberry sauce) on the side - I definitely prefer the thai curry sauce while my mom mixed both sauces together. The duck was seriously cooked to perfection. We also had the shrimp pad thai - it was okay - it wasn't great but it wasn't bad. It's pad thai - I think the $18 price is a bit much for pad thai.

Would I go back again? I think for the Crispy Duck - yes. [Edit]: I received a message from a fellow yelper that on the Saturday they went, there was a 30-45 minute wait. Since I loved the Crispy Duck so much I've decided to have my birthday dinner there. Will keep you posted."}

{"original_text": "LL Cool J performed much better in this movie that I expected! He did a fabulous job acting as a \"renegade\" cop within a \"renegade\" department. From the very beginning, he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he's in. He acts as a sort of \"gentle giant\" -- a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody, yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start -- and he does an amazing job. He was quite clearly the best character in the movie.This was certainly a performance that will not win Morgan Freeman any awards. After starring in powerhouse films like the Shawshank Redemption this film was certainly a step down. His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor -- and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner. There are so many ways his character (Moses Ashford) could have taken a more pivotal role. That he didn't was disappointing and a true let-down. I was hoping to see more from him in this film.Timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry. His portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive. This movie is a typical action movie that (at least initially) bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs LA has experienced in the past. Being an action movie, it has its share of shoot-em-up scenes, blood, and guts. These scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable. Watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end -- think of what you would typically expect in a good-cops/bad-cops conflict -- and it bears little resemblance to a REAL police shoot-out.What irked me most was the way Timberlake's character behaved during shoot-out scenes. He starts out having guns and not using them. Then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he's been firing a gun his whole life. Then he runs out of bullets and doesn't have a gun -- and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything -- suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns AND extra ammo?! Little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me.If what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay, then you'll probably love this movie. Personally, it doesn't matter to me what KIND of movie it is as long as it is realistic. Make me believe that the story is true.

The scene is set in a bustling Budapest parfumerie, where two employees, Claudia (Margaret Sullavan) and Hugo (James Stewart), are locked in a bitter feud. Unbeknownst to them, they've been exchanging fiery letters with each other under the pseudonyms Amalia and Joseph, believing they've found their soulmates in the process. The hilarious misunderstandings that ensue as they try to reconcile their real-life animosity with their blossoming cyber-love are both heartwarming and side-splitting. The film's witty dialogue is a joy to behold, exquisitely delivered by the stellar cast. Margaret Sullavan shines bright as the fiery, independent Amalia, while James Stewart is in top form as the bumbling but lovable Hugo. Supporting performances from veterans like Frank Morgan and Sarita Mercer add depth and warmth to this delightful story. Directed with grace and finesse by Ernst Lubitsch, \"The Shop Around the Corner\" is a true testament to the power of human connection. Its themes of love, friendship, and the importance of seeing past first impressions remain as relevant today as they were eight decades ago.

King's directorial debut showcases an astute understanding of suspense, humor, and the human condition, making it a perfect blend of genres. The film opens with an enigmatic and eerie event: the sun is knocked out of the sky by an unknown force, leaving the earth in perpetual darkness. Almost instantly, inanimate objects come to life, hunting humans with a terrifying ferocity. The ensuing chaos is captured with a deft balance between comic relief and bone-chilling horror. The characters, played by an outstanding ensemble cast, including Emilio Estevez, Laura Harrington, and John C. Reilly, are well-developed and multidimensional, adding depth to an already thrilling storyline. The visual effects, while dated, hold up remarkably well, thanks to a steady dose of practical effects and an unapologetic style that embraces the cheesiness of the premise.

The restaurant offers a great combination of traditional American fast food and amazing ice cream, making it a perfect destination for those craving both a satisfying meal and a sweet treat.

The patty was cooked to perfection \u2013 juicy, flavorful, and perfectly seasoned. The bun was soft and fresh, and the toppings added an excellent touch. I also appreciated the variety of options for toppings, allowing me to customize my burger to my liking. Now on to the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance \u2013 the frozen custard. Freddy's frozen custard is a standout, offering a creamy, delicious texture that is unparalleled compared to other fast-food ice creams. The flavors are unique and delicious, with a wide selection to choose from. I opted for the cookiedopter, which was a delightful blend of cookie dough and custard. The portion size was generous, making it a perfect sweet treat to share or enjoy all to myself. The restaurant itself was clean, welcoming, and efficient. The staff were friendly and attentive, making the experience even more enjoyable. I also appreciated the convenient drive-thru option, making it easy to grab a quick bite on the go.

{"original_text": "The only reason I'm giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played Tadashi's tormentors were not up to the job. I presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy, but they were not well coached, and their scenes were a minor annoyance. I say not to judge this by U.S. standards because it's full of ambiguities and the kinds of equivocations that Japanese culture readily embraces, and is not beholden to the black-hat/ white-hat moral constraints U.S. kids' films are routinely subjected to. For example, there is a preciously funny moment when Tadashi's small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai, and Shojo--the avuncular Kirin herald--does what many a stressed-out Japanese adult would do. Hint: this would not happen in a Disney film. This picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids' movie. Early on, there's a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book. There was a TV commercial in Japan a couple years before this movie came out. It was a stop-motion clay animation about a kid who's depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room. His mother yells at him from downstairs to shut up.

I mention this commercial, because it was considered funny, and I didn't hear any objections to it while I was there.

As a parent, if this were a U.S. film, I would be up in arms about such things, although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture, which, of course, are also not black and white. Since it's a Japanese movie, I accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a U.S. production.

{"original_text": "This review is LONG overdue! I visited Stitch-It in June 2013 In brief: Stitch it did an EXCELLENT job on my dress and I was extremely pleased. I needed it done in a rush and they were able to accommodate me. Given the tight turnaround, and the work that needed to be done, I didn't mind paying a premium. The service and results far exceeded my expectations. Complete Experience: I was attending a convention in Nashville, TN and had ordered an evening gown online a week before (admitted procrastinator tendencies). The gown was a navy blue Tadashi Shoji evening gown with sequins and an intricately designed lace and sheer layered bodice. The gown was a tad bit too long and there was a bulge in the back. The dress arrived a few days before I was scheduled to fly out to Nashville and I knew I wouldn't have time to get it tailored before leaving. I found a few Nashville area tailor shops on Yelp, read the reviews and decided I might try Stitch-It. I also saw a few cleaners that advertised they performed tailoring services, but they (quite frankly) didn't give me the warm and fuzzies. Stitch-It was about a 30 minute drive from the Gaylord Hotel where I was staying, so before taking a taxi that far, I decided to check with the hotel to see if they had an in-house tailor. When I took the dress to the Gaylord tailor/seamstress (who was the nicest lady ever), she looked at the gown and said \"I can hem the bottom....I'd have to do it by hand. The top part though....I won't touch that with a 10ft. pole!\" I laughed, but appreciated her honesty in not being able to handle the work that I needed done. I contacted Stitch-It and sent pictures of the dress via text message to a nice young man who's name I can't remember (I think it was Cameron...I could be wrong). They assured me that they should be able to accommodate me, so I hopped a cab and visited Stitch-It. When I arrived I was greeted by courteous and professional staff. I was shown to the dressing room and changed into my gown. My personal tailor was Maggie O'Neill and she was AWESOME! After the fitting and pinning, I left the gown and picked it up in two days. It fit perfectly and was well worth the fee. If I lived in Nashville, I would DEFINITELY use Stitch-It on a regular basis.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This review is LONG overdue!

He puts on the gladiator's helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers.This thing is just so utterly senseless it's maddening. Here's a short list of things that don't make any sense:1) A guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside. The guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside. Then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent - arriving the next morning?!? He was only 50 feet away!2) These two dunderheads then hear another girl scream (What, 100 feet away?), but don't investigate because they're afraid they'll get lost.3) Another guy and a girl are walking around, and in about their 10th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances, protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor. I mean, what the...? First off, that's just a really stupid thing to say, secondly he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together.4) A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and he stops her, telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing. Um, yeah, we kinda noticed she's wounded and not dead because she's up and walking around. But, thanks for that tidbit of information.5) One girl is tied up in Demonicus' lair, and when someone attempts to free her, she instead instructs this person to go and get help. Um, look, idiot, if she set you free, which would take about 5 seconds, there would be no need to get help.And it just goes on and on. The whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods, then they fight, then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends, then they wander around some more. It's just so damned boring and pointless that I turned the DVD off halfway through. None of these characters are sympathetic, especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time. Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him - he looks like a kid in a Halloween costume, scrunching his face up to look evil. He runs, or should I say scampers around like he's gay. The special effects are comedic, the acting is for the most part awful, and nothing makes any sense.Overall, maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it, getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue, creating characters with actual likable personalities, having some sort of logical flow to the action, and maybe even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit.

Um, yeah, we kinda noticed she's wounded and not dead because she's up and walking around. But, thanks for that tidbit of information.5) One girl is tied up in Demonicus' lair, and when someone attempts to free her, she instead instructs this person to go and get help. Um, look, idiot, if she set you free, which would take about 5 seconds, there would be no need to get help.And it just goes on and on. The whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods, then they fight, then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends, then they wander around some more. It's just so damned boring and pointless that I turned the DVD off halfway through. None of these characters are sympathetic, especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time. Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him - he looks like a kid in a Halloween costume, scrunching his face up to look evil. He runs, or should I say scampers around like he's gay. The special effects are comedic, the acting is for the most part awful, and nothing makes any sense.Overall, maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it, getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue, creating characters with actual likable personalities, having some sort of logical flow to the action, and maybe even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit. But no, instead we get this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death."}

{"original_text": "Title: A Bittersweet Reunion of Friends in \"The Big Chill\" In \"The Big Chill,\" Lawrence Kasdan masterfully weaves together a tale of loss, love, and friendship through an intricate tapestry of human emotions. The film opens with the sudden death of a college friend, which brings together the surviving members of their group to mourn and reflect on their lives. Kasdan's direction is impeccable, as he skillfully balances the comedic and dramatic elements throughout the story. The acting is superb, with an all-star cast led by Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum, and Kevin Costner, who all deliver nuanced performances. Each character is complex and relatable, making the audience care deeply about their personal journeys of self-discovery. The cinematography is beautiful, with its crisp fall foliage serving as a poignant backdrop to the unfolding drama. The iconic soundtrack, which includes songs like \"The Weight\" and \"Let's Stay Together,\" perfectly complements the film's tone and enhances the viewing experience. However, \"The Big Chill\" is not without its flaws. Some of the character arcs feel underdeveloped, leaving viewers wanting more depth. Additionally, the pacing can be uneven at times, making certain scenes drag on unnecessarily. Despite these minor issues, \"The Big Chill\" remains a poignant and thought-provoking exploration of loss, love, and the complexities of human relationships. It is a must-watch for fans of character-driven dramas and anyone looking for a heartfelt tribute to the bonds of friendship.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Director: Lawrence Kasdan Starring: Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum, Kevin Costner Genre: Drama Rated: R for thematic elements, language, and some sexual content, partial nudity, and brief drug use, running time: 90 minutes MPAA rating: MPAA description: A Bittersweet Reunion of Friends in \"The Big Chill\" explores the bonds of friendship through the eyes of a group of friends who come together to mourn the sudden death of a college friend and reflect on their lives, in the fall of 1994.)

{"original_text": "I. THE NIGHT - A THRILLING AND ENJOYABLE MOVIE EXPERIENCE The Night is a riveting cinematic experience that leaves audiences on the edge of their seats.

They must unravel the mystery behind the sudden blackout and the connection between them before the danger outside reaches them.

The ensemble cast delivers strong performances that bring depth and complexity to their characters. Viewers cannot help but be invested in the fates of these seemingly ordinary individuals as they are forced to confront their darkest secrets and deepest fears. Furthermore, the movie's atmosphere is a significant contributing factor to its enjoyment. The setting, a seemingly abandoned house, is expertly utilized to create a sense of unease and tension. Shadows dance in the darkness, and every creak and groan of the old structure adds to the ominous ambiance. The movie's score effectively complements the visuals and enhances the sense of foreboding.

The whole movie centered around an unattractive man who had a fear of females, four beautiful but empty minded women who worked as waitresses at his uncle's diner, and his enormously fat and extremely miserable cousin who also works at the diner.

And I have always been disappointed. \"L'Intrus\" was no exception. She has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one. You get a lot of the Denis regulars: an older but still magnificent B\u00e9atrice Dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lips, the gap between her teeth, her ample cleavage, and a couple of nice coats; the black guy from \"Trouble Every Day\" and \"J'ai pas sommeil,\" Gr\u00e9goire Colin, and that Lithuanian or Russian girl.

After a series of strange accidents and experiences in the house, Charles begins to believe that the creation my have come to life and is haunting him and his wife. Probably one of the better entries in the film, it's easily the creepiest. The atmosphere here is what sets it apart. The scenes with the fictional character are genuinely creepy, the mystery surrounding him is really effective and there's always a classic creep-out moment. The classic moment is the kill in the psychiatrist's office, which is an all-time high for creepiness. The build-up to it, with the creaking sounds, quick flashes of a mysterious being, and the thunder and lightning in the back ground work well for this one's favor.Sweets for the Sweet-Moving into a new house, widower John Reid, (Christopher Lee) hires former school teacher Ann Norton, (Nyree Dawn Porter) for his young daughter Jane, (Chloe Franks) while he's away on business. Ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from Jane's past, which John vehemently denies. When she learns the true nature of what has happened, it's far more shocking that what she could've thought possible. With the creepiest outright plot and the biggest twist of the stories, this is a quite pleasant entry. The mystery of the family is wonderfully played out, with small amounts of clues piled up here and there, and the final revelation is downright nerve-wracking. That part alone is the main reason why this one works, and Lee doesn't harm it either.The Bad Story(s): Waxwork-Tortured by memories of his lost love, Phillip Grayson, (Peter Cushing) and his friend Neville Rogers, (Joss Ackland) both become infatuated with a statue of a woman in a Wax Museum, as the statue takes over their lives, they discover a shocking secret about the museum that haunts the both of them. There's a clever premise here, and it does provide an excuse to spend time in a wax museum, which are always creepy. This is no exception, and it looks eerie, which is helped by the florescent lighting on display on the sculptures. A dream sequence provides a great moment of suspense, but what ultimately kills this one is the slow pace. It takes a long time for events to unfold out, and most of the time is spent on exposition. It also builds up to a shock ending that can be seen coming from a mile away. Those really lower this one a bit.

Unconvinced the cloak is the cause, he does everything he can to prove it's just in his imagination. This has a pretty decent premise, and there is plenty of opportunity for some decent scares, but what sinks it is several factors. First, it's just too goofy for it's own good. The plot twist at the end is a perfect example, which is so overdone that it's not really a shock at all, and just comes across as just plain silly. There's so few scenes of scares or attempted scares that it's just a bore to sit through.

{"original_text": "I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his love of the American people and the land. In A River Runs Through It, Redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot).Redford's cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years.What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands.

Yes, even they got their hands into low exploitation sickies like this, and Bamboo is definitely among the worse attempts of the whole genre, even when compared to the Western attempts that usually pale in comparison with the Eastern films!The story is about a Japanese war camp in which the Chinese women are brutalized, abused and raped by the bad Japanese (what else?) during the World War II. The girls also know a secret place in which a box full of gold is hidden and also learn that a Chinese military officer raised in Japan (Shaw veteran Lo Lieh) is actually now an undercover agent among the other Japanese and naturally helps the girls escape the hell. What follows is sequences full of gratuitous nudity, female kung fu, some nasty torture, gore, sleaze and extremely offensive anti Japan attitude that make this film pure and honest garbage that doesn't even try to be more than it is.There are hardly any interesting elements in Bamboo House of Dolls. The occasional photography especially at the end looks nice with its sunbeams and beautiful nature but that's about it in the merits department. The fight scenes are plenty and always include half naked females hitting and kicking each other. The violence overall is quite nasty at times with several bullet wounds, misogynistic torture scenes (for example, one poor girl is brutalized on the floor filled with broken glass etc.) and extremely repulsive ending and moral behind it. Of course it is stupid to talk about \"moral\" when writing about this kind of film, but still there are elements I won't accept to be found from any film.The film has also some enjoyable turkey elements for sure! For example, the gold box, filled with heavy gold, seems suspiciouly light as the weak and suffered girls don't seem to have any problems lifting and moving it, not to speak of throwing it! Also those numerous \"skin fight scenes\" make this quite smile inducing for fans of trash cinema. I have seen the same director's Killer Snakes (1973) which is ten times more noteworthy as a piece and even though it has many alive snakes killed for real, it is also visually more interesting and shows us some nasty sides of the other side of the big city and society.

{"original_text": "Three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relation. The base of the triangle is barely there. At the apex is Marie, a serious, short and lean tomboy with a Belmondo-like facial structure. Her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite: coquette, chubby -- I dare say fat -- and desirous for her first kiss with a boy but not quite ready for her first sexual encounter. Because of her chubbiness, boys don't seem interested and it pains her.The other leg of the apex is a beautiful \"fille fatale\" blonde vamp. She is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming performing at competitive level. Marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool. Marie insinuates herself into the life of the vamp using the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument. The vamp has a reputation of being a whore, making out with any young male that orbits around her. Marie is not phased out by that reputation. Put a stress on reputation.The first half is set up.

The film centers around a retired police detective, John \"Scottie\" Ferguson, who becomes obsessed with a woman he is hired to follow. The more he gets to know her, the more he becomes infatuated, but their relationship is complicated by the fact that she seems to be hiding a dark secret. Watching a movie like \"Vertigo\" can be an immersive and thought-provoking experience. I'm not surprised that you're feeling something after watching it. The film explores themes of obsession, identity, and the complexities of human relationships. It's a great example of Hitchcock's ability to create suspense and keep viewers engaged from beginning to end. If you're looking for more films by Hitchcock or similar directors, I would recommend movies like \"Rear Window,\" \"Psycho,\" and \"Memento.\" Alternatively, if you're interested in examining the themes of \"Vertigo\" in more depth, you might try reading critical analyses of the film or watching documentaries about Hitchcock and his work.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Q: What is the best film you've ever seen and what is it about it that made you want to go back and watch it again?

{"original_text": "I. just. watched \"Battleship Potemkin\" and I must say, it is an extraordinary film. The reasons for its greatness are numerous, but I'll highlight a few that come to mind: 1. Powerful and emotional storytelling: The film tells the story of the mutiny on the Battleship Potemkin in 1905 Russia, where the sailors rebel against the cruel treatment of their officers. Director Sergei Eisenstein masterfully crafts the narrative using powerful imagery, iconic scenes, and suspenseful pacing. The emotional impact of the film is undeniable. 2. Innovative filmmaking techniques: \"Battleship Potemkin\" is considered a landmark in the history of cinema, with its groundbreaking techniques that influenced filmmakers for generations to come. Eisenstein's use of montage, repetition, and the juxtaposition of contrasting images create a visually stunning and thought-provoking cinematic experience. 3. Historical significance: The film not only showcases Eisenstein's artistic vision but also serves as an essential historical document. It powerfully conveys the struggles and injustices faced by the working class in early 20th-century Russia, allowing viewers to gain a deeper understanding of the context and significance of the Russian Revolution. 4. Relevance and timelessness: \"Battleship Potemkin\" continues to resonate with audiences today, as its themes of social and political upheaval, class struggle, and the power of collective action remain relevant in our contemporary world.

{"original_text": "I guess if a film has magic, I don't need it to be fluid or seamless. It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this film: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, yet they don't detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix. Both characters are smart. Yet Stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood. Iris, although well-educated, hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the U-turn her life took. In both their faults and strengths, the characters compliment each other.

It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this film: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, yet they don't detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix. Both characters are smart. Yet Stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood. Iris, although well-educated, hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the U-turn her life took. In both their faults and strengths, the characters compliment each other.

In the Arts & Entertainment section, the shows were lackluster and left a lot to be desired. I was expecting more interactive and engaging performances but instead found myself bored and restless. The arcade area was a save grace, with a nice variety of classic and new games. However, the prices for plays were on the pricier side, making it less enjoyable for families on a budget. When it came to the active life attractions, such as minigolf, go-karts, and race tracks, there were long lines and maintenance issues. The karts I rode in were uncomfortable, and the go-kart track had several potholes, making for a bumpy experience. Lastly, the mini golf area presented a poorly maintained course, with overgrown vegetation and numerous holes with broken or missing flags.

{"original_text": "Time Out New York named this one of the top 20 Italian restaurants in the U.S. It was the only restaurant on their list not located in a major food city (NYC, Chicago, etc.) and as it happened, it's a 5-minute drive from my home. I figured I had to try it. The restaurant itself is the size of a postage stamp, with maybe 10 tables. You're not getting in without reservations, so if you're interested in eating here, make sure you call ahead. Would I call this one of the best Italian restaurants in the country? Frankly, no. That doesn't mean it's not good. But dining out is about more than just the food, and this is the area I feel is lacking. I'm not talking about the servers, who were friendly and knowledgeable. Due to the size restrictions and the fact that the restaurant is almost completely wood-furnished, the noise level is INSANE.

The pasta was well made (perfect consistency), the sauce was decent (it had a nice spice, but the lemon was a little overwhelming -- and I say that as someone who loves citrus). I am not sure that the saltiness of the bottarga was the perfect complement to this dish, either. I had the rabbit for my entree. It was excellent: fall-off-the-bone tender and served in a great sauce. I was a bit disappointed, though, that it was served with just a few unremarkable potatoes as the garnish.

In the later scene we see a full regiment with drum and bagpipes marching into an ambush. In the British army, a sergeant does not order up a rescue attempt, and if you get past that, he does not attempt it with only one other soldier and an Indian servant when there is a full regiment on hand. The Indian insurgents are so incredibly inept it is laughable...there are hundreds of them but they can't hold their prisoner or kill the two rescuers, of course not. At one point we see the British soldiers throwing blocks of stone down from the battlements at the insurgents, who are scattered around the mountainside in ambush...one would have to have an eggplant for a brain to think this would do any damage. After Cary Grant as the rescued prisoner is shot, he lies on the floor looking around at the water boy...hardly the actions of someone who has been shot in the back.

Aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence, the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980's cartoon based on a line of action figures. The bad guy himself even talks like a Skeletor wannabe, has the obligatory inept henchman, and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon. Just don't expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue. At other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai, yet there is no sex, no tentacle rape (Thank goodness!) and very little sex appeal, this despite the physical appearance of the title character. There is simply no adult edge to this material, unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths.

{"original_text": "This is possibly the worst film I've ever seen. The fact that it has a flimsy storyline is bad enough, that they've hooked it around the subject of football violence makes it 100 times worse.I had severe doubts about the premise of this film even before I started watching, but went into it open minded enough even to accept the way that the writers saw fit to introduce Elijah Wood's character Matt into the hooligan scene.But the film throws up inaccuracy after inaccuracy, to the point that by the middle of the film each one makes you cringe harder than the time before.Let's clear up a few things: Hooligans don't tend to virtually smash up their own pub before a run-of-the-mill league game; they don't set out to kill each other; they don't ONLY wear Stone Island (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not, do). They most certainly don't, when having taken exception to a new firm member, trot off to their rival firms territory for pie and mash. And I'd love to meet the hool who would go and grass on his firm's top boy to the rival firm. (Although you can scratch what I said about setting to out kill each other if one does exist).Don't get me wrong,I'm yet to see a film on the subject that doesn't contain some fantasy whims, but this is on a par with The Firm for cluelessness.I found it ironical that Wood's American nemesis is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user, when this is part and parcel of the British hooligan scene. The film chooses not to challenge Wood's morals and instead steers clear of any of the firm using coke.I could go on, but I think I've made my point.As for the plot, it's highly unimaginative, and I'm sure if I hadn't spent the entire film bemoaning the points, and more, made above then I would have guessed what was going on sooner than I did. And believe me, I was well in front.I get the distinct impression this film is aimed at men, with the hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional issues that are raised.If I'm right, then the makers have failed completely. It's too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene, and I can't believe the kind of female who looks for emotive films would give a damn about any of the characters given their violent tendencies.Are there any good points? Maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but I'm rarely impressed by slow-mo action, certainly not when it's a fight as the point is a ruck is rousing enough anyway.There are some funny, if unrealistic moments.

But a few mildly funny moments hardly make up for watching two hours of complete fabricated dross.If you're British avoid like the plague, if only not to further develop misconceptions of the scene if you're not in the know.

{"original_text": "Title: A Chilling and Thrilling Journey into the Unknown - \"The Funhouse\" \"The Funhouse,\" a 1981 horror classic directed by Tobe Hooper, is a chilling and thrilling journey into the unknown. The film follows a group of teenagers who, on a romantic getaway, visit a traveling carnival where they stumble upon the eponymous funhouse. With its dilapidated exterior and eerie atmosphere, the funhouse promises a terrifying experience - a promise that the film delivers in spades. The acting is superb, with Shawn and Amy, played by Shawn Carson and Elizabeth Berridge, delivering standout performances. Their on-screen chemistry is palpable, and their fear and terror are genuinely heart-wrenching. The supporting cast also shines, with each actor bringing depth and nuance to their respective roles. The special effects and makeup are another highlight of the film. The transformations of the creatures, brought to life by the genius of makeup artist Gianetto De Rossi, are still disturbing and effective, even by today's standards. The practical effects, combined with Hooper's masterful direction, create a truly immersive and terrifying experience. The score, composed by Tobe Hooper and Michael Small, is haunting and adds to the overall atmosphere of the film. The suspenseful music perfectly complements the visuals, creating a tense and nerve-wracking experience. Overall, \"The Funhouse\" is a must-watch for horror fans and those who enjoy a good old-fashioned scare. It's a testament to the power of practical effects and the mastery of Tobe Hooper.

{"original_text": "This review is based on my one experience here that was for a large birthday party. We think the wings were so tasteless because they had to make so many for us ahead of time.

The cocktail bar at Altamura is stunning - the dim lighting, cozy seating, and lively music created a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. The bartenders were skilled and attentive, crafting creative and delicious cocktails using top-shelf ingredients. But Altamura is not just a cocktail bar - it's also a fantastic Italian restaurant. The seafood dishes were the highlight for me. Each plate was beautifully presented, and the flavors were brilliantly balanced. The pasta was cooked to perfection, with just the right amount of al dente bite. The nightlife at Altamura is also not to be missed. The vibe was lively and energetic, making for a great evening out. And the service was exceptional - our waiter was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. Overall, I would highly recommend Altamura to anyone looking for a fun and delicious night out.

In fact, the film is filled with references to classic films: The Roulette Wheel (Casablanca), \"chicken clucking\" (Rebel Without a Cause), references to Bunuel, \"Touch of Evil\"; you'll find more. The homeless man (Georg Stanford Brown)is a reference to Cuban folklore which often uses a black man as a type of Greek chorus.What this film really is is the culmination of a dream. Gerard's wish to honor his family and medium of film that he has loved all of his life.This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people in it are real,as are the events depicted. Gerard is actually an architect and engineer (and passionate film lover) but his dream was to make this movie. He and his wife decided to live that dream and Harvey Keitel became an \"angel\" who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and star in it. Keitel holds the screen powerfully as the mysterious and secretive grandfather \"Che\". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) offer strong support in key roles.Truthfully, the first half of the film suffers from stiff delivery of lines, and some overracting, but stay with it.

{"original_text": "it does not fully capture the complexity and nuance of the real-life character, Adrian Cronauer, on whom the movie is based. While Robin Williams gave an excellent performance as a radical DJ in the U.S. Armed Forces radio station in Saigon during the Vietnam War, the movie glosses over certain historical and cultural contexts. Moreover, some critics argue that the script takes many creative liberties with the facts, which may disappoint those looking for an accurate portrayal of the historical events. Overall, while \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" is an entertaining and often amusing film, it falls short of being a great one due to its inadequate exploration of the intricacies of the time and place in which the story is set.

My lady friend ordered a bowl of the turkey chili...and I am glad she went with a bowl versus a cup, because, well...the hummus never came. The turkey chili was quite delicious, and I give it a good recommendation. I elected to go with one of the day's specials...walnut-encrusted chicken with haricot verts and mashed root vegetables. What does that mean exactly? Parsnips instead of potatoes? Parsnips AND potatoes? I am pretty sure there was no yucca involved. LOL I digress. The mashed root veggies was the star of the plate though. The string beans tasted of charred water. The walnut-encrusted chicken was a tasty idea, but the crusting was quite overcooked, again lending a burnt flavor. The chicken came covered in a maple gravy...mild taste of maple, and it was a cream gravy. I was expecting a brown gravy with the maple flavor. The waiter did not bring me a knife and fork, which was his second strike after the missed hummus. I was so hungry I did not care, however. I cleaned my plate thoroughly. On to the ice cream!!! My lady friend and I split a belgian waffle, topped with ice cream. As the man, the choice was left to me to pick the ice cream flavor. I went with cinnamon bun, and it was GREAT. The waffle was hot and freshly cooked perfectly, slightly underdone and soft which favored the ice cream on top. The creamy cinnamon flavor was very decadent, especially because it included multiple globules of cinnamon-sugarized butter. Wowzers. The service was a little sketchy and I had some issues with my entree, but I would definitely come by and give them another chance.

Dave Greco (Jimmy Dean), a small-town boxer, makes his way to New York City to pursue his dreams. After a particularly brutal match, the naive and innocent Dave is drawn into a terrifying underworld populated by the mysterious and sinister Gloria (Irene Kane).

Equally great is the script which doesn't talk down to its audience, using some real expressions not normally heard in animated films (not Disney nor Pixar). Its all really well done.Is it perfect? No, some of the bits go on too long, but at the same time its is damn entertaining.If you get the chance see this.

No one wants to see a Chuck Norris movie where HE is not the main character.There was a good fight scene at the end, but the rest of the movie stank. I have to wonder if old Chuck just can't hang with the best any more. Has he slowed down so much that he has to turn out junk like this and hope that his reputation will carry him through the entire movie? Chuck is an awesome martial artist, and as we have seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, a fairly good actor, but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his movies, and this one does not.

I understand it is something out of there control but when developing a restaurant your seating calculator is based on parking spots available. This will let you use areas more productively and efficiently. Also it is very confusing where the front door is or where guests are to come in. The signs in the back just make things more confusing.

{"original_text": "After \"Star Wars: A New Hope\" redefined science fiction, and \"The Empire Strikes Back\" redefined \"Star Wars\", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job. The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war. There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor. When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion. This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader. It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them. There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well. With the light tone of \"A New Hope\" and the more sinnister tone of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale. The Special Edition for \"Return of the Jedi\" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it. Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense. Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved.

The film, directed by Bob Rafelson, offers a raw and uncompromising look into the disillusionment and unraveling of the American dream.

From the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The salon was immaculately clean, and the soothing music played in the background created a tranquil ambiance. The nail technician who attended to me was professional, courteous, and genuinely passionate about her work. She took her time to understand my preferences and delivered a beautiful set of gel nails that not only looked stunning but also lasted longer than I expected. The spa services I tried, including a relaxing massage and a revitalizing facial, were equally impressive. What sets Queen Nails & Spa apart from other salons is their commitment to using only the highest quality products and providing exceptional customer service. The prices were reasonable, and I appreciated the personalized attention to detail throughout my visit. In conclusion, Queen Nails & Spa is a gem in the world of nail salons and spas.

That didn't sound very hopeful, and alas, it was worse than I'd suspected.A laddish Robin I can take; a Robin who tangles with a pert dyer's daughter I can credit; but a Robin who exchanges not-very-funny banter with his single henchman is harder to swallow, and a Robin and *entire cast* who seem to be having difficulty managing their lines is the kiss of doom. How could anyone let such laboured delivery pass without re-shooting the scenes? Again and again, Much sounds as if he's struggling with half-comprehended Shakespeare rather than letting loose with a salty quip; I hoped at the onset that it was just a failed comedy trait in a character clearly destined for the role of comedy sidekick, but then it started spreading throughout the rest of the cast.Whatever else you say about Errol Flynn in the role, he had the knack of delivering high-flown dialogue as naturally as if he'd just thought it up on the spur of the moment.... and as this production shows, that's not at all as easy as it sounds! If they were going to cast the characters as cheeky chappies, the actors in question should have been given appropriate lines: they sound as if they haven't a clue how to handle them.I'm afraid I didn't even like the pantomime Sheriff, for a similar reason; the lines are clearly not intended to be taken seriously but delivered (and in this case written) with a nudge and a wink at the audience. They're out of place all right -- fourth-wall-busting stuff -- but really not that funny.This much-promised production reminded me of a limping school play. The only actor and character I felt any appreciation for at all was the one playing Guy of Gisbourne, who was the sole one who appeared to have any handle on (a) credible villainy and (b) credible characterisation -- but frankly, I wouldn't have said that was a very good augury for the future of the series! As of the time of writing, I'll give it another shot in the hopes that things may improve and bed down a bit by next week, with less stilted scene-setting required and perhaps the actors more at ease with the dialogue: after all, the opening episode of \"Doctor Who\" wasn't exactly a show-stopper, though it was nowhere near as bad as this.

The narrative follows Philip Marlowe, a jaded and world-weary private detective, as he becomes embroiled in the investigation of his best friend's disappearance. Chandler's writing is exceptional; his prose is poetic and evocative, and his character development is nuanced and captivating. Marlowe's wit and humor shine through the text, balancing the gritty realism of the Los Angeles underworld with moments of levity and introspection. The plot of \"The Long Goodbye\" is both labyrinthine and sophisticated. Chandler masterfully interweaves multiple storylines and red herrings, keeping the reader guessing until the very end. The twists and turns of the narrative are unexpected and thought-provoking, and the resolution is both satisfying and thought-provoking. Moreover, \"The Long Goodbye\" stands out for its portrayal of female characters, who are portrayed as complex and multifaceted beings, rather than mere objects of desire.

Overall, \"The Long Goodbye\" is a must-read for fans of the genre and newcomers alike. Its intricate plot lines, complex characters, and poetic prose make it a timeless and enduring classic.

{"original_text": "I have always dreaded going to the hair salon. I hated the phony atmosphere of most places and I really dreaded the small talk I would be forced to have with my stylist. Maybe I am unusually insecure, but I always felt intimidated in most salons. Then, one day a couple of years ago, I wandered into Andre's salon and I never looked back. Andre is warm and personable and made me feel at ease immediately. Right off the bat, we connected on a topic I care about--dogs--and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all. Oh, and the cut and color were fantastic! My highlights last longer than highlights I have received from any other salon. For the past year or so, Christopher has been styling my hair and I LOVE him to death. He is incredibly sweet, down-to-earth and talented! My hair looks amazing for days after he styles it and, try as I might, I can never get it to look as good as he can. The last time I was at the salon, Christopher, Leah and I had a blast reminiscing about'80s fashion! I can't remember a time when I enjoyed going to the hair salon (which is probably because I never have!). Also, back in the spring, I asked Andre if he would be interested in donating a gift for a charity 5K I was helping to organize. Being the wonderful person he is, Andre didn't hesitate and put together a beautiful basket that was a hit at the race! Andre has a good heart and that it what I love about going to his salon! I also love that clients can schedule appointments online through schedulicity! Great prices, great cuts, great color, great space, convenient scheduling options and, most importantly, great people--you will not regret choosing Andre for your next cut or color!", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I have always dreaded going to the hair salon.

Navy's deep-sea diver training program that is run by a racist zealot (Robert DeNiro). If the program weren't bad enough, it's got to be located in Bayonne, New Jersey.There's nothing wrong with the performances. Robert De Niro activates his Southern accent and shouts gibberish effectively. Cuba Gooding, raised by a stern father as a poor black farm boy in the South, is the expectable paragon of rectitude. The girls -- one could hardly call them women -- are Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee. They have minor roles and are mostly there to argue that their men should exercise common sense. Other decent performers -- Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook -- have even more perfunctory roles.That's about it. Almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer. A ship is called a boat. Robert De Niro salutes indoors, uncovered. After a brutal assault on hospital personnel, he's transferred out of his outfit instead of being busted. Somebody shouts \"I'm outta here\" in the early 1950s. (Maybe it was a common expression at the time. If so, \"my bad.\") People address each other by rank -- \"Lieutenant\", \"Boatswain's Mate,\" \"Commander,\" as they do in the Army, whereas in the Navy they are simple \"Mister\" (if an officer) or addressed by their last name (if enlisted). I didn't bother to check if there was a rank called \"Senior Master Chief\" in 1950.Cuba Gooding has a tough row to hoe. Everyone in the Navy, it seems, hates Negroes except for one guy from Wisconsin. He stutters and is held in contempt by the others in his class. It's like the scene in \"Animal House\", in which the applicant to a tony fraternity is asked to wait in a room with a Sikh, a black man, and a blind kid.Gooding is an enlisted man, a second class petty officer. He manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from medical school. In one of their arguments she pleads with him. She just wants to be a doctor and he should join her, quit the Navy, and lead a quiet life. \"And just let life pass you by?\", he retorts. Yes. Yes, just be a doctor's spouse and let life pass you by. You can wave to it from the golf course in Boca Raton.These kinds of flicks were common enough in World War II. \"Bombardier,\" \"Airial Gunner,\" that sort of thing. Cheap as they often were, they had some educational features. You learned something about becoming a bombardier or a gunner. Here, the technical details are skipped over, perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them (except Boyle's law, which we learned in high-school chemistry).I couldn't follow what was happening during some of the emergencies without which a movie like this wouldn't exist.

The atmosphere was unpleasant \u2013 the decor seemed outdated and the music playing in the background was not to my liking. Additionally, the artists didn't seem very welcoming or professional. When it came time for my tattoo consultation, the artist was in a rush and didn't take the time to truly understand what I wanted. I left feeling unsatisfied and uncertain about my decision to get a tattoo there. I believe that a good tattoo parlor should offer not only great tattoos, but also a pleasant atmosphere and good communication between the artist and the client. Sadly, Poison Apple Tattoos did not meet those expectations for me.\" Please keep in mind that your review should reflect your personal experience and is meant to help potential customers make informed decisions.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "If you'd like to write a review about your experience at Poison Apple Tattoos, please use the form on the right side of this page to tell us what you think about the tattoo shop and the service it provided.

{"original_text": "I really wanted to like this movie. It has a nice prison setting, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly hideous 80s-touch and it is a directorial effort by actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad (you guessed it) a bad guy. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror flicks. But the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish/frightening moment in there. It just goes on and on and on, and then it (logically) has to end. More suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I really wanted to like this movie.

So much for the fact that Hellman was merely echoing the Communist party line, the line didn't change until a couple of months later. Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work.The play Watch On The Rhine ran from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson as the butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest son, Lucile Watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas.Lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and the New York Film Critics for Best Actor. Probably if the Tony Awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well. The Oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy, and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was. Lukas's nomination is usually the kind the Academy gives to round out a field.Jack Warner knew that which is why Mady Christians did not repeat her Broadway part and the role of Lukas's wife was given to Bette Davis. Davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her, but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it. It's the same reason she did The Man Who Came To Dinner, a much lighter play than this one.Davis is the daughter of a late American Supreme Court Justice who married a German national back in the Weimar days. After many years of being vagabonds on the continent of Europe, Davis Lukas, and their three children come to America which has not yet entered the European War. They're made welcome by Lucile Watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren.The fly in this ointment are some other house guests, a friend of Davis's from bygone days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe, a Rumanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris. Coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects Lukas's anti-fascist background. His suspicions are quite correct, it's the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they've become. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there. His health has not been the same since. His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes. Those decisions affect all the other members of the cast.Adding quite a bit more to the Broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was Dashiell Hammett who was Lillian Hellman's significant other. Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy was a Hammett creation with such loathsome types as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders.Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account Runmanian count.

{"original_text": "In order to avoid confusion, let me clarify a couple of points: I am not a red neck. I am not even a moderate nor a conservative. Quite on the contrary, I am a radical: a Libertarian. I'm not a WASP either, I was not even born in the States.Jorge Luis Borges used to say that there are some kind of folk who do not feel poetry, and that these sad people usually earn their living teaching poetry. This movie was made by and for people who do not feel poetry, by and for show-offs; and I dare say, by and for people who have no sense of decency or, for that matter, respect for other people's life or death (especially when the victims are thought to be mostly'bloody imperialists' killed in Yankee soil.) I even find the original marketing idea of the eleven episodes of eleven minutes, nine seconds and one frame as particularly hideous and repulsive. Just plain awful. Why didn't they assign a budget of as many dollars per episode as individuals were brutally murdered in the attack? The whole idea rests somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism. Anybody who is serious about film-making (and serious about life and death) should have angrily declined to participate in this recollection of innuendoes and non-sequiturs.

I am not even a moderate nor a conservative. Quite on the contrary, I am a radical: a Libertarian. I'm not a WASP either, I was not even born in the States.Jorge Luis Borges used to say that there are some kind of folk who do not feel poetry, and that these sad people usually earn their living teaching poetry. This movie was made by and for people who do not feel poetry, by and for show-offs; and I dare say, by and for people who have no sense of decency or, for that matter, respect for other people's life or death (especially when the victims are thought to be mostly'bloody imperialists' killed in Yankee soil.) I even find the original marketing idea of the eleven episodes of eleven minutes, nine seconds and one frame as particularly hideous and repulsive. Just plain awful. Why didn't they assign a budget of as many dollars per episode as individuals were brutally murdered in the attack? The whole idea rests somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism.

{"original_text": "I'm sorry if the film, \"The Boys from Brazil,\" left you feeling unpleasant or disturbed. The Holocaust-themed thriller, based on the novel by Ira Levin, is known for its dark subject matter and intense scenes. If you need some suggestions on how to process these feelings, here are a few ideas: 1. Take a break: Give yourself some time and space to unwind. Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax. 2. Reflect: Consider what aspects of the film resonated with you and why. It's natural for art to provoke emotions and thoughts, even if they're not pleasant. 3. Share your feelings: Talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling. Sometimes just talking about it can help bring clarity and relief. 4. Learn more: If you're interested in understanding more about the Holocaust and its aftermath, there are many resources available, including books, documentaries, and museums. 5. Do something positive: Try to channel your emotions into something positive. Volunteer your time, donate to a worthy cause, or take action in some other way to make a difference. Remember that it's okay to feel unpleasant emotions after watching a film or engaging with difficult subject matter. The important thing is to take care of yourself and find ways to process and move forward.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "I'm sorry if the film, \"The Boys from Brazil,\" left you feeling unpleasant or disturbed.

In fact, when he spots her husband there again, he phones Jill and tips her off.Jill returns to the hotel, sees Sean with another woman. She is upset, leaves without Sean seeing her, and does absolutely nothing. In fact, she doesn't even say anything to Sean when he arrives home. This made no sense to me.Jill has given Richard her business card, and so he calls her and she is apparently in real estate. She shows him a condo. Afterwards they have a drink, and things get cozy between them.Richard and Jill are getting it on, hot and heavy.

In fact, when he spots her husband there again, he phones Jill and tips her off.Jill returns to the hotel, sees Sean with another woman. She is upset, leaves without Sean seeing her, and does absolutely nothing. In fact, she doesn't even say anything to Sean when he arrives home. This made no sense to me.Jill has given Richard her business card, and so he calls her and she is apparently in real estate. She shows him a condo. Afterwards they have a drink, and things get cozy between them.Richard and Jill are getting it on, hot and heavy. In fact, he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary, when Jill suddenly decides to cut out.Jill and Sean have a confrontation about his cheating. Sean whines about how Jill has been letting him down since her father died. Apparently his lack of any morals is all her fault."}
{"original_text": "This is the one in which the diminutive Ruth Gordon plays an Agatha-Christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe. Gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of suffocation, while Gordon is traveling back and forth to New York. He manages, however, to leave behind some clues, scratches on a couple of black safe deposit boxes and an improvised and well-hidden note. Columbo enters the case, suspects her at once, and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is on hand as Gordon's secretary and would-be blackmailer. Hartley is, I believe, the grand daughter of the psychologist B. F. Skinner. I'm not sure her ancestry had anything to do with her attractive belly button, which is on display during a belly dance sequence, but I've always admired Skinner anyway.The murder is well handled. It's a good plot, and none of the performers or crew fluff anything. But the outstanding figure here is Ruth Gordon, only a skosh over five feet tall. She was over 80 years old and looked it. There are moments when she almost teeters, but she consistently exudes charm. Her acting is idiosyncratic. You can never be sure when she's being serious or when she's putting Columbo and the audience on. She's given some good lines too. What humor there is comes from Gordon. Columbo doesn't have any of his frequent comic moments.All in all, a nice job by everyone concerned.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This is the one in which the diminutive Ruth Gordon plays an Agatha-Christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe.

The cast is excellent as their characters, and I wouldn't want to change them in any way.For those unfamiliar with this show, Pushing Daisies centers around a man named Ned (aka The Pie Maker, played by Lee Pace) who discovered a special gift when he was a boy: He could bring the dead back to life with the touch of a finger. He first did so with his dog, Digby. However, there is the catch: If he keeps a dead person alive for more than one minute, someone else dies. He learned this when he brought his mother back to life, and his childhood crush's father died in Ned's mother's place. The other catch is if he touches the person again, they're dead again, but this time for good. He learned this when his mother kissed him goodnight.

{"original_text": "This was basically an attempt to do the same thing with \"Batman\" that was done with \"Gilligan's Island\" in \"Surviving Gilligan's Island.\" For those of you who missed it (and shame!) \"Surviving Gilligan's Island\" (full title: \"Surviving Gilligan's Island: The Incredibly True Story of the Longest Three Hour Tour in History\") was a special from a few years back, where Bob Denver (\"Gilligan\"), Dawn Wells (\"Mary Ann\") and Russell Johnson (\"The Professor\") related the story of the show's creation, cancellation, rediscovery & rebirth. Along the way, stories were dramatized with actors portraying the original cast and crew. It was very well done. It was funny, well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show.\"Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt\" is in a similar style. The re-telling of the history of the show, the re-enactments, the general feel are all the same. What's missing is the straightforward approach that \"Surviving\" took.In \"Return\", Adam West and Burt Ward both receive invitations to a car show to which they were not meant to be invited. After being allowed to stay, Adam and Burt witness the theft of the centerpiece of the show: the legendary Batmobile! Adam and Burt decide to chase after it themselves, leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show. This eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the Batmobile and why.Choosing to use this conceit (actually having a plot) is the biggest letdown of this show. Unlike \"Surviving\", \"Return\" forces the viewer to follow a less interesting storyline (the theft of the Batmobile) instead of focusing all its attention on what the audience would most be interested in (the history of the show.) It is the historical sections that work the best. The casting (as in \"Surviving\") is excellent. Jack Brewer (\"Adam West\") and Jason Marsden (\"Burt Ward\") capture the feel of the actors without looking *too* much like them. Brett Rickaby (\"Frank Gorshin\") bears a stronger resemblance to his subject, but captures none of the late Gorshin's charm, only his characterizations. Other actors' portrayals are short and functional, with none standing out as especially good or bad. Many of the stories have been told before, but they mostly play out amusingly, with only the occasional clunky presentation. Another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of Lyle Waggoner's tryout for the part of Batman. The only place where the flashbacks fail is when they insert obviously made up plot points to advance the main story. This downgrades the accuracy of the flashbacks needlessly.The \"main plot\" (if that is what we must call it) is, of course, ludicrous. This is not really a fault in and of itself, but it's just not carried off well enough to cover up the shortfall. Strong performances and good writing can make up for a silly plot (especially in these kinds of things) but we really get neither, here. The performances by West and Ward seem somewhat flat (even for them); the dialog too carefully written for it to feel natural. Again, I think the comparison to \"Surviving Gilligan's Island\" can be seen in that the dialog is mostly just there to set up a flashback. In \"Surviving\", that's all it intends to be. In \"Return\" it tries to do double duty and, unfortunately, often fails. Gorshin and Newmar do well (although I agree with others that Gorshin had not aged well and that Newmar had - and what's Waggoner taking to look that good?) but aren't given enough to do. Again, I think they all would have been better served by a more straightforward presentation than the one chosen here.Another odd point about \"Return\". This special is about the \"Batman\" TV series and its history, yet all the clips shown are from the theatrical movie. Even the Waggoner footage is technically movie footage. If you know you're \"Bat-history\", then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first, only to be delayed in favor of the TV show when CBS needed to fill time fast. So when Waggoner and West were testing for the role, it was for the movie, not the TV show. Why \"Return\" only uses movie footage is unclear. It most probably has to do with rights issues, but it is a distinct distraction to those in the know: seeing Julie Newmar in the present, but only footage of Lee Meriwether as Catwoman in the past.Overall, I liked the show, mainly for the flashbacks. I would have preferred the style used in \"Surviving Gilligan's Island\", but I can understand why they'd want a more story-oriented piece given the subject matter. Besides, I like these people. It's nice to see them out and about, still having fun with one of the great pieces of entertainment history.

This timeless classic remains a testament to Leone's cinematic vision, and an essential addition to the western genre canon. Whether you're a seasoned fan or a curious newcomer, there's no denying the power and enduring appeal of this cinematic tour de force."}

We stopped at four local vineyards and did thorough tastings at each. We enjoyed many of the offerings and even purchased a few bottles to bring home with us. Shawn was also extremely patient-he never rushed us at any of our tour stops and really gave us the chance to try different wines and enjoy the beautiful Santa Ynez weather.

{"original_text": "\"A Damsel in Distress\" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's better musicals. But even Astaire's bad films always had some good moments.In \"Damsel,\" Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is in London on a personal appearance tour. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers.Jerry believes that Alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. He tries to rescue her from her family's country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor Lady Alice will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner) the conniving butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet.This musical has numerous problems. First, there is the plot, based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). The story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. When Fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert conniving against them and each other.The butler and the house boy are especially irritating. They are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. You wish they would get off the screen and let Fred dance.Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. She has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.George Burns and Gracie Allen are along for the ride, as Jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. The duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times.The direction of the movie by George Stevens is not well done. At times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in London, not Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the plus side, the songs by George and Ira Gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. And of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan.But the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. At times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (At one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) The numbers include: \uf0b7 \"I'm Dancing and I Can't Be Bothered Now\" -- Fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled London street. He does some great \"cane-twirling\" with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical, \"Crazy For You,\" Harry Groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.)\uf0b7 \"Put Me To The Test\" -- Fred, George, and Gracie do a trio tap dance in an English cottage. George and Gracie match Fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason.\uf0b7 \"Stiff Upper Lip\" (The Fun House Number) -- At an amusement park fun house, Fred, George, and Gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. It's the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times.\uf0b7 \"Things Are Looking Up\" -- Fred and Joan Fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. Fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer.\uf0b7 \"A Foggy Day in London Town\" -- Fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London. At times, he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself.\uf0b7 \"Nice Work If You Can Get It\" -- A great song that is misused in the movie. During a social event at the manor house, Fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. Each time Fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. (Again, Harry Groener did a better dance number with this song in \"Crazy For You.\") \uf0b7 \"Drum Dance Number\" -- As Fred and Joan are eloping, Fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. As usual, it's a great dance number. But there's absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie.The most contrived moment in the film comes when Fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. As he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that's right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.The movie is worth owning on DVD for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote. The >>FF button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "\"A Damsel in Distress\" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's better musicals.

{"original_text": "The story of Ned Kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand, and this film is no exception. What ensures Ned Kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him. During several battles, he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron, off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce. Indeed, it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the Victorian police who noticed he hadn't plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged. The story has been told in schools and histories of Australia for so long that some permutations of the story have, ironically, become boring. The more the stories try to portray Kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster, the less people pay attention.Which is where this adaptation of Our Sunshine, a novel about the Kelly legend, excels. Rather than attempting to portray a Ned Kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore, the film quickly establishes him as a human being. Indeed, the reversal of the popular legend, showing the corruption of the Victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists, goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd. Here, Ned Kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder, one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it. No, I am not making that up. About the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the Irish versus English mentality of the battles. While the Kelly gang were distinctly Irish, Australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly (a scene with some Chinese migrants highlights this).Heath Ledger does an amazing job of impersonating Australia's most notorious outlaw. It is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching Ledger and not Kelly himself. Orlando Bloom has finally found a role in which he doesn't look completely lost without his bow, and Geoffrey Rush's appearance as the leader of the police contingent at Glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state. But it is Naomi Watts, appearing as Julia Cook, who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film. Although the film basically implies that Cook was essentially the woman in Ned Kelly's life, but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here. Indeed, a lot of the film's hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze-dried than explorative. Once the element of police corruption is established, in fact, the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed.Unfortunately, most of the film's strengths are not capitalised upon. Rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits. Ditto for Watts, and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins. I can only conclude that another fifteen, or even thirty, minutes of footage might have fixed this. But that leads to the other problem, in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact. One scene manages to do the speech-making thing well, but unfortunately, it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while. If one were to believe the impression that this film creates, a matter of weeks, even days, passes between the time that Ned Kelly becomes a wanted man on the say-so of one corrupt policeman, and the infamous shootout at Glenrowan. Annoyingly, the trial and execution of Ned Kelly is not even depicted here, simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll.That said, aside from some shaky camera-work at times, Ned Kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts, and it has a good beginning. For that reason, I rated it a seven out of ten. Other critics have not been so kind, so if you're not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements (and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout?), then you might be better off looking elsewhere.

{"original_text": "In a famous essay he wrote about Charles Dickens, George Orwell points out that many readers always regretted that Dickens never continued writing like he did in PICKWICK PAPERS: that is, he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career. This would not have been too difficult for Dickens. His contemporary Robert Surtees did precisely that, only concentrating on the misadventures of the fox hunting set (MR. FANCY ROMFORD'S HOUNDS is a title of one of his novels). Among hunters and horse lovers Surtees still has a following but most people find his novels unreadable. Dickens was determined to show he was more than a funny man (and don't forget, his first book, SKETCHES BY BOZ, was also a funny book). So Dickens third book is OLIVER TWIST (which got pretty grim at points). Orwell says that for any author to grow they have to change the style of their books. Dickens would definitely (and successfully) have agreed to that.But Orwell overlooked the genre writer who transcends his fellows. Surtees, as I said, is a genre writer concentrating on hunting - but not everyone is interested in hunting. But P.G.Wodehouse saw himself as an entertainer, poking fun at the upper reaches of the British social system. His Earl of Emsworth is prouder of raising the finest pig in England than being...well Earl of Emsworth! His Psmith is always prepared to counterattack when he is supposed to be submissive to an unfair superior. His Stanley Uckridge will always have a \"perfect\" scheme that should net a huge profit (but always manages to come apart at the end). And best of all, his Jeeves will always put his brilliant brain to work rescuing the inept Bertie Wooster, his boss. Since Wodehouse had a limited view of his mission as a writer - he was there to do cartoon figures of fun for the entertainment of the world - his books never lost their glow. They served (and still serve) their purposes. In fact, compared Wodehouse with his far more serious contemporary Evelyn Waugh, who also wrote funny books, but of a more intellectual type. The best of Waugh remains among the high points of 20th Century British literature: BRIDESHEAD REVISITED, DECLINE AND FALL, and the rest. But in his determination to make his points, if his points failed to interest the reader the book frequently collapsed. For every VILE BODIES there was some failure late in his career like THE ORDEAL OF GILBERT PINFOLD. While Wodehouse could do lesser hack work too, his falling did not go as far as Waugh's did.Wodehouse also was a gifted lyricist (when you hear \"Bill\" in the score of SHOWBOAT, it is not Kern and Hammerstein's tune, but Kern and Wodehouse's tune transposed from \"Oh Lady, Lady\" a dozen years earlier). He was a handy dramatist too. So it is pleasing to see that he took his novel A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS and turned it into the screenplay here.It has the normal Wodehouse touches. That perfect butler Keggs (Reginald Gardiner in a wonderful performance) is a scoundrel in rigging a \"friendly\" gambling game of chance among the staff of the stately home he heads. He is also unable to refrain, occasionally, from singing Italian opera - despite Constance Collier's attempts to control his impulse. This is typical Wodehouse characterization. So is the way the love affair between Lady Alyce and Jerry keeps going well and going down due to the antics of Keggs and young Albert, both of whom want to win that game of chance pot of cash. Wodehouse always does that type of plot switch, with antagonists switching their point of view depending on their present state of interest.Wodehouse was also lucky here to have Burns and Allan to work with. It is generally considered that of all the films they made as supporting actors together (such as SIX OF A KIND and WE'RE NOT DRESSING) George and Gracie did their best support with Fred Astaire. The Fun House sequence, which includes the song \"Stiff Upper Lip\", is wonderful, as is an earlier sequence where the three do a \"whisk broom\" dance (that Astaire learned from Burns). But Gracie's marvelous illogical logic is used by Wodehouse in scenes with Gardiner (see how she manages to confuse him into giving her more money than her change deserves to be - only Albert happens to notice Keggs/Gardiner's mistake, and looks at Gardiner as though he's either stupid or mad). Her dialog with Lady Caroline (Collier)'s son Reggie (Ray Noble, the British band leader)leading him to imagine that he will marry her, but saying goodbye to Gracie as she drives off with George to get married is wonderful too.The film supposedly failed at the box office because of the lack of Ginger Rogers in it, and the weakness of Joan Fontaine. Fontaine is not doing a remarkable job in the role, but the flaw is really Wodehouse's - he didn't make the character very interesting. But the film can stand without that, given the other performers and their characters, Gershwin's music, and Wodehouse's marvelous sense of fun.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "In a famous essay he wrote about Charles Dickens, George Orwell points out that many readers always regretted that Dickens never continued writing like he did in PICKWICK PAPERS: that is, he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career.

{"original_text": "*May Contain Spoilers* A few weeks after I had originally wrote my review for Hood of the Living Dead I realized that I may have been a bit too harsh on this movie. Which is why I decided I would do something I had never done before. Review the same movie again. Don't get me wrong, I still don't like the movie, I still think it's dreck, and I still think the zombies don't look all that zombie-ish. The story in the movie is still in my opinion, weak and rather lame. The story is about a guy named Rick, who works as a scientist (that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells, in animals) and his brother Germaine, the two aren't exactly on the best of terms (my my, an original plot point) and argue a lot. One day Germaine is shot in a drive-by shooting, and Rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to resuscitate Germaine(whereas most people would've called 911, but whatever), naturally the serum fails and Germaine \"dies\" (if that didn't happen there'd have been no movie), after the police and the coroner (until the end of time I will still think that maybe the paramedics should've shown up) leave the scene shows the coroner van (which I still believe was just someone's van with a \"coroner\" decal thrown on the side), and Germaine returning to life to attack and kill the paramedics. I would talk more about the plot, but I feel that if I reveal more about the story you wouldn't want to watch it (and we wouldn't want that now would we?), but suffice to say that the story (in my opinion at least) meanders and is rather slow moving (pun not intended). As I've previously said in my review the zombies don't look all that much like zombies, I still think they look like they've been in a bar fight. That's not to say that they should all be decaying and whatnot, but still there should at least be bite marks on the victims. Also I still don't like the fact that the director(s) continually switch up the pace at which the zombies move. They couldn't really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombies run or shamble (as most zombie movies do), don't get me wrong, I'm all for running zombies but make up your minds people. In one scene the zombie runs toward the living, and in the other he just shambles to them. And sometimes they just don't seem believable (yes I know their fictitious creatures but still), I am of course referring to the zombie that runs his hand on the wall as though he were walking through a dark living room, and I still don't like the zombie who is lying on the ground, gets shot, then jerks like he was just shot. The sound in the movie also bothered me, mainly the music, which while it may have just been my copy of the film seemed pretty much non-existent. Music in a movie is important folks. Especially when the sound editing does sound like the director just took a friends camcorder and shot a little zombie flick. The acting is still atrocious (in my opinion) and is on par with the American \"actors\" from the Japanese zombie movie Junk. The movie is still bad, almost House of the Dead bad, it's better, no doubt about that, but then again that's not saying much. It's not the worst movie out there, and it is better than a lot of direct to video movies that are out there but at the end of the day wasn't good. I also think the movie moves really really slow, despite the fact that it is only an hour and twenty or so minutes (and yes, I still don't like the opening song). This is the type of movie I think is well-suited to be premiered on the Sci-Fi network. Which is why I am obligated to give this debacle of a film a one out of ten.

We were in and out during peak dinner hours on a weekend evening in just under an hour. Will definitely return when we're in the area!"}

Celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the County of Los Angeles, while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon CD-ROMS, but when disaster befalls \"Mistress Vanessa\", virtuous Celia, determined to unearth her sister's vicious attacker, begins a new job as a \"sex slave\" at the private Castle Club where the specialty of the house is a \"dungeon party\". Two FBI field agents (whose deployment to the Vanessa case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet BDSM sites), in addition to a Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective, are assigned to investigate the crime, while endeavouring to provide security for Celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her.

The shrimp they served in the jambalaya and gumbo could not be smaller. Service was lacking.

Though Laurence Olivier is mostly associated with his Shakespearean work he shows in this film that he is by no means restricted to play only classical theatre. He manages the transition from the cynical divorce solicitor, who tries to avoid women and their traitorous ways, to the lovesick puppy that falls for Lady X played by Merle Oberon effortlessly. The dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanting. Ralph Richardson was a delight to watch as well.

Character Development: Some characters lacked depth and motivation, making it hard for the audience to connect with them emotionally.

{"original_text": "This is the true story of how three British soldiers escaped from the German Prisoner Of War (POW) camp, Stalag Luft III, during the Second World War. This is the same POW camp that was the scene for the Great Escape which resulted in the murder of 50 re-captured officers by the Gestapo (and later was made into a very successful movie of the same name). While the other POWs in Stalag Luft III are busy working on their three massive tunnels (known as Tom, Dick & Harry), two enterprising British prisoners came up with the idea to build a wooden vaulting horse which could be placed near the compound wire fence, shortening the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to freedom. The idea to build their version of the Trojan Horse came to them while they were discussing'classic' attempts for escape and observing some POWs playing leap-frog in the compound.Initially containing one, and later with two POWs hidden inside, the wooden horse could be carried out into the compound and placed in almost the same position, near the fence, on a daily basis. While volunteer POWS vaulted over the horse, the escapees were busy inside the horse digging a tunnel from under the vaulting horse while positioned near the wire, under the wire, and into the woods. The story also details the dangers that two of the three escaping POWs faced while traveling through Germany and occupied Europe after they emerged from the tunnel. All three POWs who tried to escape actually hit home runs (escaped successfully to their home base.). The Wooden Horse gives a very accurate and true feeling of the tension and events of a POW breakout. The movie was shot on the actual locations along the route the two POWs traveled in their escape. Made with far less a budget than The Great Escape, The Wooden Horse is more realistic if not more exciting than The Great Escape and never fails to keep you from the edge of your seat rooting for the POWs to make good their escape. The story line is crisp and the acting rings true and is taut enough to keep the tension up all the way through the movie. The Wooden Horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the escapees, Eric Williams, and is, by far, the best POW escape story ever made into a movie. Some of the actual POWs were used in the movie to reprise their existence as prisoners in Stalag Luft III.

{"original_text": "If any style of film could be called my \"guilty pleasure\", it'd be this generic fantasy type. Guilty is the wrong word for it, though, as I'm pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time. \"Stardust\" is good stock fantasy, the likes of which one should expect from Neil Gaiman (or Gaiman adaptation, as it were). It isn't the visual dream-scape of Mirrormask, it isn't the adult pretension of Pan's Labyrinth, and it isn't the fun-loving classic The Princess Bride, but it contains just what the fantasy-lover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing.

{"original_text": "I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed \"Porky's\"! It's a classic comedy film from the 1980s that has stood the test of time. The film follows a group of high school students as they plot to get into a local strip club, Porky's, which is known for its strict door policy. As I watched the movie, I couldn't help but be entertained by the antics of the main characters and the colorful supporting cast. The film's humor is often crude and sexually explicit, but it's delivered with a wink and a nudge that keeps it from becoming too offensive. I also appreciated the film's exploration of themes like adolescence, rebellion, and the pressure to fit in. However, I must admit that there were some parts of the film that I found uncomfortable or problematic. For example, there are several scenes that objectify women in a demeaning way, and some of the language and behavior displayed in the film would not be tolerated in contemporary society. I believe that it's important to acknowledge these issues while still appreciating the film for what it is - a product of its time and a reflection of the cultural norms and values that were prevalent during the 1980s. Overall, I would recommend \"Porky's\" to anyone who is looking for a nostalgic and entertaining viewing experience. It's not a perfect film, but it's a fun and engaging one that is worth checking out.

The film opens with the ethereal image of a young woman, Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina), a naive and innocent circus performer, purchased as a roadside attraction by the cruel and sadistic strongman, Zampano (Antonio Galetta). As they traverse the Italian countryside, a complex and bittersweet relationship develops between Gelsomina and Zampano, filled with moments of tenderness, cruelty, and heartbreak. Fellini's cinematic vision is a feast for the eyes, with each frame meticulously crafted to evoke a sense of wonder and melancholy. Masina's heart-wrenching performance as Gelsomina is a testament to the power of youthful innocence in the face of a cruel and unforgiving world. The compelling score by Nino Rottino adds depth and emotion to every scene, leaving the audience in a state of both enchantment and sorrow. \"La Strada\" is a raw and powerful examination of the human condition that resonates long after the final frame.

{"original_text": "I'm sorry to hear that you had an unpleasant experience at Creekside Inn. Despite the varying business categories listed, I will focus on providing feedback based on the general atmosphere and ambiance of the place. Upon arrival, the exterior of the Creekside Inn did not inspire much confidence as it seemed run-down and in need of some maintenance. This initial impression carried through to the interior, which was dimly lit and appeared outdated. The tables and chairs were worn, and the overall cleanliness of the establishment left something to be desired. The staff were not particularly welcoming or attentive, which added to the overall unpleasant experience. There was a lack of energy and enthusiasm in how they interacted with patrons, making it difficult to feel at ease or comfortable. The food and beverage offerings were not noteworthy, with mediocre taste and presentation. The prices, however, did not reflect the quality of the items served. Regarding the event planning and services, I did not have the opportunity to witness them firsthand, but the lackluster atmosphere and service level did not instill confidence that they would be up to par. In summary, my visit to Creekside Inn was disappointing from start to finish. I would advise potential patrons to consider other establishments that offer a more welcoming and enjoyable dining, event planning, or nightlife experience.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "I'm writing to you as a customer of Creekside Inn.

We tried to make reservations, but they do not take them. And I think we were too small to be put in the side meeting room. So hangry we stood, hoping for just the right table to leave. The manager was nice enough to offer to fill cups of coffee for us while we waited. But I thought it was odd that they just didn't refill the pot for everyone who was waiting. Now for the food...They have these 1/2 and 1/2 combos. Which I love! I got a turkey Reuben and salad. I asked for lots of sauerkraut, and they charged $0.50 for it... Which is no biggie but I'd expect a lot of kraut. Sadly there was not a lot of it... But it was still a delicious sandwhich.:) My friend got the sunrise chile rellenos.

{"original_text": "\"Cinderella\" is one of the most beloved of all Disney classics. And it really deserves its status. Based on the classic fairy-tale as told by Charles Perrault, the film follows the trials and tribulations of Cinderella, a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally unlikable stepsisters. When a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read: the King wants to get the Prince to marry), Cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her. But there is a Fairy Godmother on hand...The story of \"Cinderella\" on its own wouldn't be able to pad out a feature, so whilst generally staying true to the story otherwise, the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the Fairy Godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become Cinderella's true sidekicks. The mice Jaq and Gus are the main sidekicks, and their own nemesis being the stepmother's cat Lucifer. Their antics intertwine generally with the main fairy-tale plot, and are for the most part wonderful. Admittedly, the film does slow down a bit between the main introduction of the characters and shortly before the stepsisters depart for the ball, but after this slowdown, the film really gets going again and surprisingly (since \"Cinderella\" is the most worn down story of all time, probably) ends up as one of the most involving Disney stories.The animation and art direction is lovely. All of the legendary Nine Old Men animated on this picture, and Mary Blair's colour styling and concept art (she also did concept art and colour styling for \"Alice in Wonderland\", \"Peter Pan\", \"The Three Caballeros\" and many many others) manage to wiggle their way on screen. The colours and designs are lovely, especially in the Fairy Godmother and ball scenes, as well as in those pretty little moments here and there.Overall, \"Cinderella\" ranks as one of the best Disney fairy-tales and comes recommended to young and all that embodies the Disney philosophy that dreams really can come true.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "\"Cinderella\" is one of the most beloved of all Disney classics.

Directed by Sidney Lumet, this 1976 film continues to be as relevant today as it was during its release. The story revolves around Howard Beale (Peter Finch), an aging news anchor who, in a bid to save his flailing career, threatens suicide on live television. Amidst the ensuing media frenzy, Beale transforms into a prophet of sorts, delivering monologues laden with truth and raw emotion to millions of viewers. The corporate world, led by Max Schumacher (Faye Dunaway) and Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty), sees an opportunity in this ratings goldmine. The dialogues are sharp, incisive, and often bitterly satirical. They cut deep into the heart of consumerism, power politics, and the blurred lines between reality and spectacle.

{"original_text": "Here's one more beauty in the string of beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox. The movie presents the story of star-crossed lovers (one Israeli, one Palestinian)in modern Tel Aviv. The film's effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of cross-ethnic conflict, but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well.

{"original_text": "Title: A Classic Revival of Crime-Solving Drama \u2013 Dragnet Dragnet, the revival of the iconic 1950s television series, proves that some things are timeless. Joe Friday (played by Ed O'Neill) and his partner, Bill Gannon (Michael Jeter), return to the screen with their trademark no-nonsense approach to solving crimes in the City of Angels. In this updated version, the duo has new tools and technology to tackle cases, but their unwavering commitment to justice and their unique banter remains unchanged. The scripts, carefully written by both the new and old writing teams, beautifully balance the lighter moments with the heavier themes. O'Neill's gritty performance is reminiscent of Jack Webb's original performance, yet he adds depth and nuance that makes Friday a fully three-dimensional character. Michael Jeter's portrayal of Bill Gannon is equally impressive, providing the perfect counterpoint to Friday's intensity. The production values are top-notch, with the cinematography perfectly capturing the grittiness and energy of the city. The integration of modern music and references adds a fresh, contemporary feel to the show without detracting from the classic core. Dragnet is not just a loving homage to the past, but a smart and engaging updating of a classic. It's a must-watch for fans of the original series, and an excellent introduction for new audiences who seek an intelligent, captivating, and entertaining crime drama. Bravo to the creators and cast for breathing new life into a beloved classic.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "The classic crime drama Dragnet is back on TV, and it's time to dust off your bobby socks and put on your detective gear... for a few more minutes... at least... until the new season starts on Monday, 8 March at 10pm on BBC One in the UK and Tuesday, 9 March on BBC Two in the US... and then again, until the end of the season on Thursday, 8 April at 21:00 BST on the BBC One website... and again, on iPlayer... and on Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, Chromecast, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PlayStation Vue... and now on iPlayer and on iPlayer on Tuesday, 7 April at 22:00 BST and 22:00 BST on BBC iPlayer, and on Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV and Xbox One on Wednesday, 9 April at 20:00 BST and 20:00 BST on iPlayer."}

{"original_text": "I won't try to speculate as to what Brando was attempting. At his best he turns in such oddball performances, insinuating so many things at once, that it doesn't seem he does anything so much as play by unfailing instinct. Often it seems he is calling attention to some favored aspect of his character over all others, a concentration which, if followed, turns out something of a red herring, as he turns out subtler, craftier than at first appeared. This is a mastery of artifice, not naturalism, as might be associated with the Method. The role of Sky Masterson, as Mankiewicz so wonderfully realized, seems tailored for him, which is to begin with odd, and odd still at the end, because whatever it is Brando has done, he has managed a grace maybe all his own, but a consummate grace nonetheless -- again, odd, coming from an actor with limited musical ability, not ever before or after associated with the musical comedy. Jean Simmons, also oddly cast, is not quite as impressive, but certainly above just-adequate, really delightful in the Havana sequence, and never less than enjoyable throughout. And yet...perhaps because actors are both so concentrated on what it is they are doing, and characters on what it is they intend of each other, there doesn't seem to be the lovers' \"chemistry\" brought up so insistently more than once. Brando/Sky Masterson and Simmons/Sister Sarah respectively feed off one another well enough, but I for one don't see more beyond that. In a movie this outrightly dazzling and entertaining (and most everything about it, craft-wise, is just that -- dazzling), that lack would seem something tactfully and easily overlooked, but so much would depend upon true chemistry! An, at least partial, transformation of the characters through such chemistry, would lend something positively moving to the final scene. As it is, one leaves this film certainly delighted, but not really moved, except in a way as to negate the trueness of the union. Note Sister Sarah marries in her missionary's uniform, Sky Masterson in his same natty man-about-town duds rather than wedding tux. And they have changed back to those from their previous scene!Funnily enough (that is, insightfully), the most touching, and most serious, scene is, I think, between Brando and Vivian Blaine, as Sinatra/Nathan Detroit's doll, Adelaide, the only scene where these two are exclusively together, not least because there is just no hint of flirtation between them even though it takes place in Adelaide's dressing-room while Adelaide is about to change. Though one may submit there is no place for that, Sky really is the type to \"check out\" Adelaide in this sort of circumstance. He is even there to tell Adelaide Nathan will not be meeting her to elope. Adelaide and Sky are both true in their respective ways to Nathan, even piteous of him, as is demonstrated through a tone in their exchange. Adelaide is of course also frustrated and disappointed, but her anger is mitigated by her deeper feeling for Nathan, as Sky is admonishing her that she can't love a man and then wish him to be someone else.Guys and Dolls is another turn at the battle of the sexes, around the themes of gambling and salvation. Since both the compulsive gambler and the salvation seeker are more or less unconsciously courting despair, there just may be a dark secret deliberately behind Brando's and Simmons' lack of chemistry. After all, that lack may well denote an excess of narcissistic preoccupation (echoed by the Sinatra/Blaine pairing, though with considerably less self-deception involved), which might explain Brando's and Simmons' odd, rather provoking, interpretations of Sky Masterson and Sister Sarah. I realize Simmons may be mostly depicting coldness and skepticism, but Brando, though playing to confront her, isn't exactly heated and eager, and is more than keeping his distance -- he's also assimilating it, keeping his balance through it. His boldness consists in merely playing against her -- the trip to Cuba, a kiss, whatever it takes -- but he is not actually set on winning through seducing her so much as beating her then in her own turf. This may be shrewd, as playing to zeal may be the only way to get to the missionary, and through. But it makes Sky's transition from merely trying to win a bet to actually wanting Sarah Brown a little less than persuasive. Yet why does he want her? What does falling in love mean to Sky? I find the only way to get around this is by indeed accepting his humanity has kicked in, and that he does not want to end up a mere cad toward Sister Sarah, so he does, as he's promised her, need to deliver the sinners to her prayer meeting, make good by his \"marker,\" as he puts it, as a way of winning her back when it seems he had already won only to lose her. But this still denotes self-concern more than anything. However, it also allows for Sarah Brown's own self-concern, as Sky will placate the missionary in her in order to get back the lover. Neither, at least it seems, will change much by their union, except perhaps in the acceptance of the other. Yet that would seem an all but fatally uneasy proposition: acceptance of is still quite a cry away from achieving happiness in the other, let alone the transcendence they each seem to imply by \"chemistry.\" And behind all this, I suspect is Mankiewicz's full knowing.For all those who might say, in defense of Guys and Dolls yet, that not much can be expected from musicals by way of depth, I need only remind them Cabaret, The Three-penny Opera, Carousel, A Star is Born, even The Sound of Music, which I don't care for as much (and one can keep adding to this list without even reaching forward toward post-Cabaret musicals), all wrap gorgeous music and dance around dire anxieties.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I won't try to speculate as to what Brando was attempting. At his best he turns in such oddball performances, insinuating so many things at once, that it doesn't seem he does anything so much as play by unfailing instinct. Often it seems he is calling attention to some favored aspect of his character over all others, a concentration which, if followed, turns out something of a red herring, as he turns out subtler, craftier than at first appeared. This is a mastery of artifice, not naturalism, as might be associated with the Method. The role of Sky Masterson, as Mankiewicz so wonderfully realized, seems tailored for him, which is to begin with odd, and odd still at the end, because whatever it is Brando has done, he has managed a grace maybe all his own, but a consummate grace nonetheless -- again, odd, coming from an actor with limited musical ability, not ever before or after associated with the musical comedy. Jean Simmons, also oddly cast, is not quite as impressive, but certainly above just-adequate, really delightful in the Havana sequence, and never less than enjoyable throughout. And yet...perhaps because actors are both so concentrated on what it is they are doing, and characters on what it is they intend of each other, there doesn't seem to be the lovers' \"chemistry\" brought up so insistently more than once. Brando/Sky Masterson and Simmons/Sister Sarah respectively feed off one another well enough, but I for one don't see more beyond that. In a movie this outrightly dazzling and entertaining (and most everything about it, craft-wise, is just that -- dazzling), that lack would seem something tactfully and easily overlooked, but so much would depend upon true chemistry! An, at least partial, transformation of the characters through such chemistry, would lend something positively moving to the final scene. As it is, one leaves this film certainly delighted, but not really moved, except in a way as to negate the trueness of the union. Note Sister Sarah marries in her missionary's uniform, Sky Masterson in his same natty man-about-town duds rather than wedding tux. And they have changed back to those from their previous scene!Funnily enough (that is, insightfully), the most touching, and most serious, scene is, I think, between Brando and Vivian Blaine, as Sinatra/Nathan Detroit's doll, Adelaide, the only scene where these two are exclusively together, not least because there is just no hint of flirtation between them even though it takes place in Adelaide's dressing-room while Adelaide is about to change. Though one may submit there is no place for that, Sky really is the type to \"check out\" Adelaide in this sort of circumstance. He is even there to tell Adelaide Nathan will not be meeting her to elope. Adelaide and Sky are both true in their respective ways to Nathan, even piteous of him, as is demonstrated through a tone in their exchange. Adelaide is of course also frustrated and disappointed, but her anger is mitigated by her deeper feeling for Nathan, as Sky is admonishing her that she can't love a man and then wish him to be someone else.Guys and Dolls is another turn at the battle of the sexes, around the themes of gambling and salvation. Since both the compulsive gambler and the salvation seeker are more or less unconsciously courting despair, there just may be a dark secret deliberately behind Brando's and Simmons' lack of chemistry.

{"original_text": "I'm sorry to hear that you had an unpleasant experience at Robbi's Custom Leather Goods. Based on your visit, I can provide the following review: Robbi's Custom Leather Goods left me feeling disappointed. The atmosphere of the store did not inspire confidence, and the staff were not particularly friendly or helpful. In the fashion department, I found a limited selection of items, none of which stood out as especially unique or high-quality. The sewing and alterations area appeared disorganized, with piles of fabric and unfinished projects strewn about. I was reluctant to leave my own clothing in such an environment for fear of it being damaged or neglected. Moving on to the leather goods section, I was underwhelmed by the selection and quality of the items on display. Prices seemed high for what appeared to be standard, mass-produced items. I questioned the value of customizing or repairing leather goods at this establishment, given the overall lack of professionalism. Shopping for furniture reupholstery and shoe repair services at Robbi's Custom Leather Goods did not yield positive results either. The upholstery options were unappealing, and I detected an unpleasant odor emanating from the shoe repair area. As a local business, I was hoping for a more personal and effective experience. Unfortunately, the lackluster service, unimpressive selection, and disorganized surroundings led me to question the value of Robbi's Custom Leather Goods.

Yet we were all glued back to our seats by its distinct opening, which lacked credits.Some two hours later, I just sat there wondering: how could I not have heard of this masterpiece before?...This film was Europa. Lars von Trier woke film noir from the dead, deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets, yet often there was haunting similarity with post-war German photographs I saw. And then the tricky cuts!The story itself is a hard-to-take moral odyssey that has no happy end. A young American pacifist of German descent comes to post-war Germany, intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs his countrymen dropped. But he mostly meets distrust and self-destructive defiance. He hires with Zentropa, a dining-and-sleeping-car company (modeled on Mitropa), whose owner is one of the Nazi collaborators the Occupiers whitewash. Our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the Werewolf, Nazi post-war terrorists. When he doesn't understand the world (or just Europeans) anymore, in his rage he blows up a railroad bridge under a train which he just saved.As a final note, for historical correctness: in the real world, the Werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies, they were mostly a final Nazi propaganda coup. After an SS unit assassinated the major of Allied-occupied Aachen, two months before the capitulation, the Nazis announced the creation of whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines, the Werewolf. But only a few hundred of mostly Hitler Youth received some training, and while two or three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists or forced-labourer foreigners in Bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants, with Hitler's death and the war's end it all fell apart.However, the Werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers. They feared the Werewolf everywhere, suspected it behind any serious accident - but without exception another cause was found later (ignored by some recent pseudo-historians). For example, when a gas main exploded in the police HQ of bombed-out Bremen, or when the Soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in Berlin.

{"original_text": "Title: A Timeless Tale of Teenage Turmoil - \"The Breakfast Club\" (1985) In a world before cell phones and social media, John Hughes served up a steaming plate of raw teenage emotion with \"The Breakfast Club.\" This 1985 cinematic masterpiece is a must-watch for anyone who's ever felt like an outsider or experienced the agony of high school. The tale unfolds as five misfit students - the popular girl, the jock, the brain, the criminal, and the basket case - are forced to spend a Saturday detention together. At first, they glare at each other with disdain, but as hours tick by, the walls that once separated them begin to crumble. With each passing moment, the group shares their stories, their fears, and their dreams - creating a bond stronger than any clique or label. Hughes' impeccable script brims with wit, humor, and vulnerability. His characters leap off the screen, inviting viewers to empathize and laugh at the absurdity of adolescent life. The performances from Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, and Ally Sheedy are nothing short of brilliant, making this film a true coming-of-age classic. Whether you're a fan of 80s cinema or simply love a great character study, \"The Breakfast Club\" is not to be missed. This timeless story continues to resonate with audiences 35 years after its release, proving that despite the passage of time, teenage struggles remain as relevant today as they were decades ago. So, grab a bowl of cereal, sit back, and prepare to indulge in a cinematic breakfast of champions.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "To celebrate the release of \"The Breakfast Club\" on Blu-ray and DVD, here's a look back at some of the film's most memorable moments, as well as some of its most quotable lines, in case you've missed them in the past... or want to re-watch them now... or don't know what to do with yourself..... or just want to know what it's like to be a teenager in the 1980s... or maybe even if you're just a fan of John Hughes' films... or if you know someone who does... then we'd love to have you join us for a special screening of The Breakfast Club on Friday, March 2, at 8pm at the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York City."}

{"original_text": "You get what you see--chicken fingers. They also serve wings and other overpriced items like mac and cheese (mediocre) and pastries (meh). The sauces are unique and probably the best part about this place as you won't be able to find sauces like this elsewhere. Be watchful of how full the sauce is because some of the containers are not completely full and you get jipped. Sadly you can't sample the sauces without having to buy them. My favorite is bar b q sauce. It has a slight acidic vinegar kick, but isn't bittersweet. Maybe they cut back on the sugar? The chipotle lime mayo is great. It isn't too creamy and oily. The chipotle is subtle, almost dull and a little bit more would make it better and bold. I found myself having to double dunk the chicken in this sauce to really taste it. You always finish it wishing you had a little more. I've tried almost all of them and none of them are too memorable that I can recall anything great or bad about the rest of the sauces. The breading is thin and crisp, which I appreciate. With one bite you taste the breading and chicken, and not just breading on heavily breaded chicken that other places might serve. The breading can be over salty and seasoned too much. Don't mistake this for rich and intense. It is salty. I end up drinking a lot of water with this meal partially due to this. What makes the breading suck is that it is not always fresh. Who knows how long the chicken has been sitting out. The meat can be hit or miss; the chicken can be a little parched. This is disappointing when you have a whole pound of chicken to consume that will leave your mouth dry and leave you bloated after you drink a lot to quench your thirst and high sodium intake. More often then not, I always get the dried, salty chicken instead of the juicy, tender chicken that I once got at my very first visit. Perhaps I am unlucky and get the left over stale pieces that have been sitting out long. I can only recall once when my chicken was tender and juicy when they first opened.I try to avoid wasting money here because I have not had the same type of meal since my first. However, out of desperation to try something different than the usual univ city food, I have eaten here a few times to make this review justified. What my friends and I would like to do is split up and someone get french fries from Greek Lady and the others get chicken from Wishbone. We would satisfy our elementary palates by eating chicken fingers and french fries. If you are willing to walk a few more blocks, Allegros has really good curly fries but portions are a lot bigger when you eat at the place.

Since, like most people except those taking part in medical trials, virgins seldom give up their secretions willingly, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) arranges for them to be abducted and preserved. He'll do the extracting himself. What a great cheese ball of a premise for a low budget horror movie. If The Corpse Vanishes turns out not to be the Havarti of horror, as a plain limburger it leaves an interesting aftertaste. Sure, the acting is almost awful except for the actors fortunate enough to be playing the crazed dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played The Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); his crazed brute of a brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the virgins' hair; the crazed mother of the two (Minerva Urecal); the crazed wife (Elizabeth Russell), who sleeps in a plush coffin and, of course, the crazed doctor (Lugosi). An enterprising young reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters) tracks down the doctor because of a strange orchid with a peculiarly sweet odor that had been worn by the victims. When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to stay the night, a raging storm immediately breaks out. That clue tells us some raging violence is about to erupt inside. Since it's well known that in Hollywood at this time all unmarried young women were virgins, Pat may have some unpleasant surprises to deal with. They include dark passages, a crusty laboratory where a near dead virgin is stored, a basement mausoleum and, later, a direct threat to Patricia's own glandular secretions. If she survives, what a story she'll have to give her editor. If you sample this moist slice of moldy Velveeta (and why not? Don't be superior), don't judge Bela Lugosi by the company he keeps here. He had a huge impact in Dracula (1931), but my favorite movie of his is The Black Cat (1934). As Dr. Vitas Werdegast he's a sad, ironic man protective of his two young friends.

{"original_text": "I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed \"Merry Christmas, Mister Lawrence\"! Nagisa Oshima's film is a powerful and moving exploration of the complex dynamics of power, desire, and humanity. I'm not surprising you with new information, but I'd be happy to discuss the film further if you'd like. The film is set in a Japanese prisoners of war camp during World War II and follows the relationship between a sadistic camp commander, Major Shinusugi, and one of his captives, a Korean laborer named Choji. The film also depicts the relationship between Major Shinusugi and one of the camp interpreters, Yusaku, who becomes increasingly conflicted about his role in the camp and his own desires. One of the most compelling aspects of the film is the portrayal of the complex emotions and motivations that drive the characters. The themes of power and desire are explored in depth, but so are the characters' feelings of loneliness, vulnerability, and longing. The film's title comes from a scene in which the prisoners sing a Christmas carol to the camp commander, and the moment serves as a powerful reminder of the humanity that exists even in the most inhumane of circumstances. I hope this gives you some food for thought!

I had no idea there were still so many uncharted islands out there, but if you take into account the number of movies that utilize one of these mysterious islands as a location, you'd have to assume that there are at least 50 of these suckers out there. It always winds up feeling so damned convenient and I immediately deduct points from any movie that uses this hackneyed device. Hammerhead is the story of a mad scientist who is conducting experiments on one of these uncharted islands, so the movie already had a lot to make up for before it even began.The island in this movie used to belong to Dr. Moreau, but has recently been purchased by the Re-Animator himself, Jeffrey Combs. Old Jeffrey is doing some kind of cutting edge stem cell research, which has led him to start working with sharks while searching for a cure for cancer. If that sounds familiar, that's because this is roughly the same basic set-up as the smart shark facility in Deep Blue Sea, not to mention a host of other Nu Image movies. So apparently, Jeffrey's son was dying of cancer which prompted our mad doctor to start experimenting on his progeny. He did some kind of super fancy gene splicing and so forth, turning his son into a shark-man.William Forsythe leads a crew of unknown actors to the island to look into the doctor's experiments. If someone would have given him a sailor's hat, William would have been a dead ringer for the Skipper from Gilligan's Island. In typical Bond Villain fashion, the doctor decides that all of these intruders would make nice chum for his son. Not chums, like buddies.... chum, like shark food. So enter shark-boy who starts stalking the Skipper and his cohorts all over the island. They, of course, make half-hearted attempts to escape and are thwarted over and over again while being chased by a guy in a rubber shark-man suit. The movie didn't make up any of the points that it lost for taking place on one of those dastardly deserted islands. It's funny that this movie is called Hammerhead, it made me think of an old joke.

{"original_text": "Title: A Hilariously Thrilling Ride in \"The 39 Steps\" When it comes to spy movies, \"The 39 Steps\" is not just another run-of-the-mill thriller. This adaptation of John Buchan's novel, directed by Ryan Murphy, delivers a riotously fun and inventive take on the genre that leaves audience members breathless with laughter and anticipation. From the opening frames, the film grabs you by the collar and pulls you into a whirlwind of intrigue, suspense, and downright absurdity. Our hapless hero, Richard Hannay, played with delightful panache by Daniel Radcliffe, finds himself caught up in a deadly conspiracy when he meets a mysterious woman who turns up dead in his flat. Before we know it, Hannay is on the run from the law and trying to unravel the mystery of the 39 steps, all while managing an assortment of quirky and dangerous characters. The visual style of the film is a delight, with a rich palette of colors and set pieces that transport us from the grimy streets of London to the isolated Scottish moors. But it's the comedy that really sets \"The 39 Steps\" apart. The slapstick antics and cleverly timed gags had the audience in stitches, and yet never detracted from the tension or the suspense. Radcliffe is ably supported by a talented ensemble cast, including the lovely and deadly Kelly Macdonald as Annabella Smith, and the suitably sinister David Tennant as the devious professor. Together, they breathe life into the larger-than-life characters and bring Buchan's story to vivid, contemporary life. In short, \"The 39 Steps\" is a movie that knows how to have fun. It takes a classic tale and infuses it with modern energy, resulting in a dazzling, uproarious rollercoaster ride that will leave you breathless and smiling long after the credits roll. A must-see for fans of the genre, or indeed, anyone who enjoys a good laugh!", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Daniel Radcliffe, David Tennant and Kelly Macdonald star in \"The 39 Steps\", a comedy thriller from director Ryan Murphy (TV's \"Numb3rs\"), based on John Buchan's best-selling novel of the same name, which tells the story of a British spy caught up in a deadly plot to kill a mysterious woman who turns up dead in his flat, all while managing an assortment of quirky and dangerous characters.

The story revolves around Doran Burgess, a bachelor and a violinist, who gets mistaken for a CIA agent while in Washington D.C.

The film's pacing is just right, with plenty of humor and suspense to keep things interesting. The performances are great, with Tom Cavanagh delivering a standout performance as Doran. The supporting cast, which includes stars like Lauren Tom, Daphne Zuniga, and Stanley Tucci, also delivers solid performances. Moreover, the film's direction is excellent, with some very inventive and visually appealing sequences, such as the opening credits and the scenes involving Doran's attempts to evade his pursuers. The humor is often clever and witty, and there are plenty of enjoyable moments that will leave you smiling. Overall, \"The Man with One Red Shoe\" is a well-crafted and enjoyable comedy that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a light-hearted and entertaining watch.

It's more a routine mystery, the characters are well defined but live or die according to the plot not according to their own virtues and flaws.The recent DVD (2005) release is beautiful looking and definitely the way to see the film, unless these ever get art house screenings which seems unlikely."}

However, despite its unpleasant aspects, \"Nights of Cabiria\" is also a powerful and moving film that explores themes of love, hope, and resilience in the face of adversity.

{"original_text": "I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed \"Willow\"! It's a fantastic fantasy adventure film with a unique blend of humor, action, and heart. I can see why it resonated with you. Now, let me share a bit more about the movie for those who might not be familiar. \"Willow\" follows the tale of a poor farmer named Willow Ufgood, who discovers a beautiful baby girl abandoned in the woods. With the help of a group of friends and an elusive sorceress, Willow embarks on a dangerous journey to protect the child from an evil sorcerer bent on destruction. Along the way, Willow and his companions face numerous challenges, from trolls and goblins to magic and the complexities of human emotions. One of the things that sets \"Willow\" apart is its ensemble cast, which includes the likes of Warwick Davis, Val Kilmer, Jeanne Marie Dupree, and Ron Perlman, among others. Each character adds a distinct and endearing flavor to the story, making for a truly memorable experience. The special effects, especially for the time, were also groundbreaking and added to the film's appeal. Now, back to your statement - you felt that \"Willow\" was enjoyable, but there was something more. While it's a great film on its own, I can understand why some viewers might be looking for deeper themes or connections. One aspect of the film that can be explored further is its exploration of family and personal growth. Willow, originally seen as a simple-minded farmer, steps up to protect a valuable life and becomes a hero. Throughout the journey, he learns valuable lessons about trust, courage, and understanding, and ultimately becomes a better person. Furthermore, \"Willow\" touches upon themes of good versus evil, and how appearances can be deceiving. The film showcases that often those who seem small or insignificant can have a great impact on the world. This idea is personified in Willow himself and his companions, who, despite their seemingly insurmountable odds, manage to overcome their fears and triumph against all odds. Lastly, \"Willow\" also pays homage to classic myths and legends, particularly those involving the hero's journey. For fans of the genre, it's a delight to see these elements woven into a fresh and modern tale. Overall, \"Willow\" is an enjoyable and heartfelt adventure that leaves you feeling hopeful and reminds you of the power of the human spirit.

The reason is that the film's excessive violence and gore detract from the story and characters, making it difficult for me to engage emotionally. I felt that the concentration on brutal visuals came at the expense of developing Conan as a compelling character and the plot as a coherent narrative.

{"original_text": "Being a transplanted New Yorker, I might be more critical than most in watching City Hall. But I have to say that before even getting to the story itself I was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of New York City that Director Harold Becker created.For example there's a reference to Woerner's Restaurant in Brooklyn where political boss Frank Anselmo likes to eat. There is or was a Woerner's Restaurant on Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when I lived in New York back in 1996. It was in fact particularly favored by political people in the Borough though they did have a couple of other hangouts.No surprise because the script was co-authored by Nicholas Pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories. He knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film.A detective played by Nestor Serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss Anthony Franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead, including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father was walking him to school. The story mushrooms and at the end it's reached inside City Hall itself.Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his Deputy Mayor a transplanted Louisianan, a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself. He's the outsider here and in trying to do damage control, Cusack finds more than he bargained for,Danny Aiello plays Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo and for those of you not from New York, his character is based on the late Borough President of Queens Donald Manes who was also brought down by scandal. He's very much the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them, do Aiello in. City Hall was the farewell performance on film for Anthony Franciosa, one of the most underrated and under-appreciated talents ever on the screen. No one watches anyone else whenever he's on.Al Pacino's best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed, he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself.

If you are looking for a unique salad try the Alfresco Salad with banana bread croutons, dried fruit and tasty dressing. You can top with all sorts of things, but I like the scallops.

{"original_text": "Title: Silver Bullet - A Frightfully Entertaining Werewolf Tale In the pantheon of werewolf movies, \"Silver Bullet\" (1985) stands out as a gleaming gem, offering a captivating tale of transformation, suspense, and sibling bonding. The film weaves together classic werewolf lore with small-town Americana, creating a unique cinematic experience. The story revolves around the Cushing siblings - Jane (Megan Follows) and Marty (Gary Busey), who live in Tarker's Mills, a quaint and seemingly idyllic rural community, where a series of tragic deaths suggest the presence of a monstrous killer. As the local authorities struggle to apprehend the mysterious beast, Marty \u2013 who has a history of fits and is confined to a wheelchair \u2013 insists that the murderer is a werewolf. The skeptical townspeople, however, dismiss his claims, further isolating him. Director Daniel Attias masterfully balances the horror elements with a sense of humor and familial affection, making the film accessible and engaging. The special effects, while not groundbreaking, are cleverly executed and hold up remarkably well for a movie of its age. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's evocative lens captures the unsettling beauty of Tarker's Mills, contrasting the idyllic scenes of small-town life with the terror that lurks beneath the surface. \"Silver Bullet\" offers a satisfying blend of suspense, wit, and heart, making it a must-watch for fans of werewolf movies and small-town tales alike.

The bus is adorable & mad cute with big open windows with lights surrounded to grab spectators attention;) Nice black couch with nice audio to play your jams. The downfalls to the bus is there is not enough places to put your alcohol or snacks or additional coolers. There are cup holders in between seats but if your bus is full, you won't be able to use them. There also is not place to hold on to while the bus is in motion over head so you'll have to have good balance lol. Besides that, Top shelf offers literally the best deal in town! You can't beat it really! Top Shelf's buses are not as modern or high tech equipped but was absolutely perfect for me! I will be back and so will friends and family.

Essentially asked us to leave and gave no reason.

I had taken my team out to celebrate wins at our organization and I was shocked at how my team was treated. No sooner had we arrived - 1pm - with [ 9 ] people, we were given the cold shoulder.... The door says open until 3 am but it was like the girl at the bar resented us for arriving..... Dark hair girl: was so rude she basically told us she didn't want to serve us. Everyone was happy but no-one was drunk... She was extremely rude and short with everyone. We had chosen to leave PBR to Calicoes because I like the place?!? Weird.... The police man [ Willis ] at the bar was professional when we complained but said he could do anything, even he seamed perplexed by the dark haired girls attitude....

I remembered seeing Tsunami when I was at the nearby Home Depot and the place looked appealing. I checked the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. For a Holiday weekend it was crowded, but it didn't take too long to get seated at a Hibachi table. I have been a huge Benihana fan in the past and enjoy this style of restaurant. I noticed there were a lot of drinks specials on the menu and the pricing seemed very reasonable compared to Benihana. There was one guest at the table who had a lot of questions and special requests which took some time to get sorted out, but once she was accommodated, the service moved more quickly. Not the servers fault. The portions were huge! I also didn't expect to get noodles in addition to rice, but it made for some quality left overs the next day. I ordered the shrimp, scallop and filet teppanyaki and like I stated prior the portions were generous, the fried rice was ok, just rice and egg, no veggies or proteins mixed in - pretty basic, but it was well seasoned. I was impressed with the scallops and the shrimp and quality of the filet. All was cooked properly, and the chef was entertaining and efficient.

{"original_text": "Man, this is a hard DVD to come by. I could only find it on Region 2, a Spanish import, and it was expensive.Was it worth it? Well, yes. Not so much because it's a masterpiece of film making, though directed by Curt Siodmak (the credits on IMDb.com read \"Robert\" but the DVD credits list Curt), or because it has a couple of familiar figures from other murder mysteries -- Elisha Cook, Jr., and Thomas Gomez -- but because my decade-long curiosity about the movie has finally been satisfied.Essentially, a respected but self-contained engineer (Alan Curtis) has been stood up by his estranged wife and finds himself in a New York bar with two show tickets in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat is on the stool next to his and he politely invites her to join him at the musical review. She accepts, a little gloomily. The mopey bartender gives them both the eye as they leave.At the show, the tempestuous star notices that this lady in the audience is wearing the same hat and erupts offstage with anger. The drummer in the band, Cook, leers at the silent lady but gets no response. Curtis takes the woman to her home and asks her name but she won't give it, and she doesn't want to know his. If she'd been a Longfellow devotee she'd have said something about ships that pass in the night.Okay, Curtis goes home to find his wife has been murdered in his absence. The head police officer, Gomez, turns him over to the DA. His only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady whom no one else seems to remember -- not the bartender, not the Latina star, not the cab driver (\"Al Alp\"), not the drummer -- and since the lady herself has disappeared, it's impossible to dig her up.Curtis is convicted and sentenced to die. But Inspector Gomez has thought things over and decided her's probably innocent because nobody with a brain would make up such a stupid story. He joins Curtis's loving secretary, Ella Raines, in re-investigating the case informally.They visit the supposed witnesses again. The ominous bartender is run over by a car, perhaps accidentally, so he's out of the picture. The hot-tempered Latina has left because the show closed and she's uncooperative and ignorant of the source of the hat anyway. Elisha Cook, Jr., is strangled by the real murderer but not before he is featured in a scene in which he pounds the drums in an improvised jazz group. His sweaty face assumes an expression which doesn't suggest intense focus but rather a monstrous, orgasmic insanity. His eyeballs roll to the ceiling, his mouth gapes, his hammering becomes frenzied. I laughed out loud.Nobody's performance is otherwise outstanding, but all are professional enough. Thomas Gomez is always reliable. Best performance, though, is probably by Franchot Tone. He's the real murderer and he fakes his alibi. He's reserved and artistic. Even when he faints he's decorous. I don't know how to put this precisely but Tone seems to be thinking as well as simply acting his part. Alan Curtis as the innocent engineer is near zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs in a B picture. I don't know why it's considered as classic. It's really your basic murder mystery by Cornell Woolrich, not as good as some of his others. But Siodmak's direction is sensitive.

{"original_text": "When they killed off John Amos's character they killed the show. He was the vital part of the info structure. You had a story of an inner city family's struggling to make it the best way they knew how. They were poor, they were black, and they were living proof that if you have Jesus and your family that nothing is too hard. Sure James would lose jobs and JJ would fail in school but the family always managed to find a way. James was the strong male role model that earned the income and disciplined the children. Florida was the strong lady that would everyone including James when he needed a shoulder to cry on or hug to make it. The kids had personalities and input which made them important as a family unit. Their neighbor Willona was also a key element because she represented not only a friend but some dear enough to be family. Things were bright, gritty, funny, and honest until they changed the course of the program. James dies and JJ took over the show. Flo was still mom, Thelma was blossoming into a lady and Michael was still the militant midget but JJ was the show. We were expected to believe that the family with no father or prominent bread winner was going to be able to stay in the apartment. I guess James's paycheck didn't do much for the family. They were only threatened with eviction because they said they were moving and not because no one in the house was working. I know that JJ, Flo, Thelma and even Michael eventually got jobs but come on here be for real. James worked so much that you could feel for him but the others weren't realistic at all and that's a shame.JJ was the comic relief but I felt the show need substance. It's OK to be funny but they had a chance to show a real family and what it took to survive in the real world and they threw it all away on a few laughs. Michael's character almost disappeared while the rest of the cast slipped into the shadows of the JJ Evan's show. I mean really, here was a guy that was failing in school, he kept getting laid off, and he painted for money in about two episodes. James had always been there to encourage his talent but Flo and the rest of the family didn't seem to care.Why did it take him so long to understand that painting was what he was meant to do? He could have sold painting's on the street or worked for people that print billboards and cards. (He did but something went wrong with that.)

You had a story of an inner city family's struggling to make it the best way they knew how. They were poor, they were black, and they were living proof that if you have Jesus and your family that nothing is too hard. Sure James would lose jobs and JJ would fail in school but the family always managed to find a way. James was the strong male role model that earned the income and disciplined the children. Florida was the strong lady that would everyone including James when he needed a shoulder to cry on or hug to make it. The kids had personalities and input which made them important as a family unit. Their neighbor Willona was also a key element because she represented not only a friend but some dear enough to be family. Things were bright, gritty, funny, and honest until they changed the course of the program. James dies and JJ took over the show. Flo was still mom, Thelma was blossoming into a lady and Michael was still the militant midget but JJ was the show. We were expected to believe that the family with no father or prominent bread winner was going to be able to stay in the apartment. I guess James's paycheck didn't do much for the family. They were only threatened with eviction because they said they were moving and not because no one in the house was working. I know that JJ, Flo, Thelma and even Michael eventually got jobs but come on here be for real. James worked so much that you could feel for him but the others weren't realistic at all and that's a shame.JJ was the comic relief but I felt the show need substance. It's OK to be funny but they had a chance to show a real family and what it took to survive in the real world and they threw it all away on a few laughs. Michael's character almost disappeared while the rest of the cast slipped into the shadows of the JJ Evan's show. I mean really, here was a guy that was failing in school, he kept getting laid off, and he painted for money in about two episodes. James had always been there to encourage his talent but Flo and the rest of the family didn't seem to care.Why did it take him so long to understand that painting was what he was meant to do? He could have sold painting's on the street or worked for people that print billboards and cards. (He did but something went wrong with that.) Why did he not make it and why did the others give up on their dreams?

{"original_text": "Title: A Sizzling Noir Masterpiece - \"The Big Heat\" \"The Big Heat,\" directed by Fritz Lang in 1953, is a prime example of the gritty, raw, and morally complex genre of film noir. This taut thriller, filled with shocking twists and unexpected turns, masterfully explores the dark underbelly of human nature. Glenn Ford gives an electrifying performance as the tenacious homicide detective, Dave Bannon, who investigates a seemingly mundane case of arson that leads him to the city's criminal underworld. Ford's dogged determination, coupled with an increasingly intense obsession for justice, adds depth and complexity to this iconic character. Jockeying for Ford's attention is the unforgettable Glaswegian villainess, Vera, brilliantly portrayed by Gloria Grahame. With her smoldering seductiveness and cold, calculating demeanor, Grahame brings a captivating intensity to the role. Their intense, volatile relationship propels the story forward, building up to a fiery climax. \"The Big Heat\" isn't just a noir classic for its superb performances and intricate plotting. Its striking visual style and jarringly innovative use of sound effectively heighten the tension and suspense. Lang's meticulous direction, coupled with John Alton's moody and evocative cinematography, makes for a movie experience that lingers long after the final frame. Do yourself a favor, and take the plunge into the dark and unforgiving world of \"The Big Heat.\" It's a noir masterpiece worth revisiting time and time again.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "It's hard to believe it's 60 years since the release of one of the most iconic film noirs of all time, but \"The Big Heat\" is back on the big screen in its entirety for the first time in more than a decade, as part of the BFI London Film Festival's 70th anniversary celebrations, which will take place from 7 to 11 July at the Royal Albert Hall in London's West End, and on the BBC's iPlayer app, where it will be available for free until the end of the festival on Sunday, July 10.

{"original_text": "Sam Fuller's excellent PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is the pick of the bunch from a number of early 50's Cold War-influenced low-budget noir vehicles. With a running length of under 80 minutes, PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is tough, gritty, explosive and endlessly entertaining.Widmark stars as pickpocket Skip McCoy, who has already been picked up three times. Yet McCoy can't keep his wandering fingers out of trouble- and trouble is exactly what he slides into when he grifts the wallet of gangster's moll Candy (Jean Peters). Candy's wallet contains a roll of microfilm invaluable to the Communist movement, and it's her last job for ex-boyfriend Richard Kiley to make the delivery. However, when Widmark lifts it, Peters must do whatever it takes to re-claim the film she (initially) knows nothing about.It's a tasty set-up, with Widmark's character, while not the psycho of KISS OF DEATH, a real live-wire, unpredictable and tough, yet curiously charming.When Bogart or Mitchum stepped into a film noir role you knew what you were going to get: a lone anti-hero maintaining his moral integrity and winning out in the end (Bogart), or an overly-laconic guy who allows himself to be drawn into a trap (Mitchum). With Widmark you just don't know what you are going to get, and with his incredibly modern acting style (his films always hold up well) he is amazing to watch. Here he is torn between making a big score for himself by selling the film, or handing it over to the police and fighting the \"Commies\" on the right side of the law. And he still has to pretend he never pickpocketed Peters to avoid the fatal fourth rap on his sheet.Peters gets her best role as the moll-with-a-heart-of-gold Candy. Widmark's unpredictability is perhaps best expressed in his scenes with Peters; the gorgeous tramp quickly (and rather unbelievably- the romance angle is rather rushed)falls under Widmark's spell, yet Widmark alternates between kissing her or slapping her around. Peters hard-edged beauty, yet lack of over-lacquered Hollywood glamour (Lana Turner would never have worked well in this role), is a major asset to the film. Candy is not innocent, yet she's very vulnerable, constantly being passed between and slapped around by men. Widmark knocks her cold on first meeting and wakes her by pouring beer over her face, yet by the final act he's a lot more tender to her (after she cops one hell of a going-over from Kiley). The scene in the hospital with Peters and Widmark shouldn't work, but it does.Thelma Ritter is brilliant as stoolie Moe, well-deserving of her Oscar nomination. Ritter's performance, like everything else in the film, is gritty, real and heartbreakingly honest. Her death scene is stunning. Fuller's camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting. Fuller loved a good close-up, and PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is full of uncomfortable, cloistering tight shots that only enhance the tension of the plot. Fuller isn't afraid to let the camera linger on a shot for longer than standard Old-Hollywood really allowed, yet stunningly pulls away from Ritter's death scene to give the audience maximum impact. The urban locales and unusual, confronting camera angles give PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET, a bold, uncompromisingly modern look.10/10.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Sam Fuller's excellent PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is the pick of the bunch from a number of early 50's Cold War-influenced low-budget noir vehicles.

But, in this film, he is much more like Daffy Duck of the late 30s and early 40s--a jerk who just loves irritating others!! A true \"anarchist\" instead of the hero of the later cartoons. While this isn't among the best Bug Bunny cartoons, it sure is fun to watch and it's interesting to see just how much he's changed over the years."}

{"original_text": "This could well be the worst film I've ever seen. Despite what Mikshelt claims, this movie isn't even close to being historically accurate. It starts badly and then it's all downhill from there. We have Hitler's father cursing his own bad luck on the \"fact\" that he'd married his niece! They were in fact, second cousins. Hitler's mother, Klara, called his father, Alois, \"uncle\" because Alois had been adopted and raised by Klara's grandfather and brought up as his son, when he was really his nephew. Alois was much older than Klara and so as a child she'd got into the habit of calling Alois, \"uncle.\"The scene in the trenches where Hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers. We see Hitler chase the dog through the trench, when he catches up with the poor thing he proceeds to thrash it for disobeying him. In the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and chastise the cowardly little man, but then a shell lands directly on his persecutors, and every last one, we are told, is killed outright. How then, if Hitler was the only person to survive the scene, did this tale of brutality and cowardice come to be told? Did Hitler himself go around \"boasting\" about it? - I don't think so.Next up, Hitler bullies and intimidates a poor, stressed out and war weary Jewish officer into giving him an Iron Cross! I can only assume that this Jewish officer had been a pawnbroker before fighting for the Fatherland, and had thoughtfully brought along some pledged medals from his shop, because I'm certain that Iron Crosses were not being handed out as shown in this comic farce.All the grotesque clich\u00e9s are here, not least the calming and hypnotic effect of Wagner's music upon the little man. If only the producers had kept Ian Kershaw on side. Then they might have discovered that Franz Lehar's \"Merry Widow\" was more likely to float the Fuhrer's boat than any \"Flying Dutchman\" from the cannon of Richard Wagner!Hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people but how can he ever be forgiven for his appalling taste in music?I could go on but I'd be at it for hours.Give it a miss.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This could well be the worst film I've ever seen.

As part of the buffet you get these amazing sticky buns. Though not a traditional bun it's just as gooey. It's a cross between baklava and a bun. It's made with puff pastry and is probably so bad for you. They only bring out enough buns for the table so one person. They also feature a Benedict while were there it was spinach and crab along with a ham one. I wasn't really a fan the hollandaise sauce was bland and the English muffin was super soggy. Chris ate the rest (of course). I tried it and and won't make the mistake if ordering in when we come back. Another downside was the coffee tasted slightly old and bitter. For these two flops I deducted a star. The guy working the omelet station was super friendly. Our server was ok, very friendly though.

The fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly-tied package might frustrate some, but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale which probes, disturbs, and haunts with the question: What does an evil person look like?Excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily.... forgotten.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Many mystery stories follow the standard whodunit path: murder most foul, gathering of clues, gaggle of possible perps, sprinkling of red herrings, and inevitable showdown between clever evildoer and even more clever crime solver.\"Forgotten\" abandons the well-trod and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts.

I had the curry beef sheperd's pie. It was a lot of potato and very little beef. My friends that had the fried chicken were happy with it. The service was friendly and attentive.

You described it as mediocre, and I can understand where you're coming from. \"Time Bandits\" is an unusual film, and its blend of comedy, fantasy, and adventure doesn't always gel together perfectly. While it has some memorable moments and enjoyable performances, it can also feel disjointed and uneven at times. I can see how some viewers might find it less engaging than they had hoped. overall, it's a film with some interesting ideas, but it doesn't quite live up to its potential.

{"original_text": "I watched this movie with some curiosity. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer deserved her Oscar. I came away from the film thinking YES! Having seen Muni in only one film where he was quite hammy, I expected the same type of performance here. I was happily proved wrong. Although some might criticize him as being too childlike and stereotypically simple in the Hollywood idea of Asians, I thought he was just right in the role. Keye Luke, if he'd been given the chance to play a lead role, might have played him in much the same manner.I was particularly impressed by the camera work and the use of crowd scenes, especially during the sacking of the palace where O-Lan was once a slave. The graphic and grim atmosphere of the firing squad and the drought made this an epic quite unlike others of the same time where it was all glitz and glitter.
