The menu isn't extensive, but it's got a good amount of inexpensive sandwiches, salads, and soups. Their Cuban Sandwich ($10 w/ side) was pretty excellent. The bread wasn't the traditional panini-style, but a French baguette...it was still great and had a little crispness to it. All the main ingredients (meat, mustard, pickles, cheese) were in good balance. As a Florida boy who loves his Cuban sandwiches, I would definitely recommend this. I also tried a bit of their Royal Grille, a grilled-chese sandwich with several cheeses, as well as apple slices, on whole grain wheat bread ($8.50 w/ side, extra to add ham/turkey). It was damn good and hit the grilled cheese craving just right. A side salad was also done well. For my side, I chose their \"spicy carrots\" which sounded unique. It consists of sliced raw carrots that have been marinated in a tangy dressing with crushed red pepper, served in a cup. The carrots were cold and crisp and the flavors were fantastic. The spice was just enough to be pleasant. I would definitely get these again. Our food came out super quick and our service was great.

The film's themes of perseverance and self-discovery are timeless, but the execution feels a bit dated. The character of Mr. Miyagi, played by Pat Morita, is definitely the highlight of the movie, bringing a lot of humor and heart to the role. However, the main character, Daniel LaRusso, played by Ralph Macchio, feels a bit one-dimensional and lacks the depth and complexity that would make him a more compelling protagonist.

{"original_text": "I thought \"What's New Scooby-Doo\" was pretty bad (yes, I'm sorry to say I didn't like it), since Hanna-Barbera didn't produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series. When I heard \"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue\" was in the works, I thought it could be better. But when I saw a pic of how Scooby and Shaggy were going to appear, I knew this show was going to be bad, if not worse. I watched a few episodes, and believe me, it is just yet another \"Teen Titans\" or \"Loonatics Unleashed\"-wannabe. No longer are Scooby and Shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool, creepy monsters that rob banks. Now they are going after a typical super-villain whom wants to destroy the world. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo have become more brave, too. Also, since Shaggy IS NOT going to be a vegetarian in this series, Casey Kasem (whom actually IS a vegetarian), the original voice of Shaggy, will NOT voice Shaggy. He will only voice Shaggy if he doesn't eat meat, and that was just a stupid corporate-done change to update the franchise, as if the Internet jokes weren't enough. So Scott Menville (whom previously voiced Red Herring on \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\") voices Shaggy here. Believe me, the voice is REALLY BAD! It makes Shaggy sound like a squeaky 10-year-old, and I must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look. However, Kasem DOES voice Shaggy's Uncle Albert, which is a sort of good thing. Scooby-Doo, on the other hand, does not look that well. He seems to have been designed to look more like the CGI Scooby-Doo from the live-action movies. Also, Scooby's Frank Welker voice (need I mention Brain the Dog again?) still hasn't improved. Robi, the robotic butler, is practically worse than Scrappy-Doo! He tries to be funny and does \"comical\" impressions and gives safety tips (\"Remember kids, don't stand under trees during a thunderstorm!\"), but it just doesn't fit into a Scooby-Doo cartoon. Again, the Hanna-Barbera sound effects are rarely used here. However, on one episode, \"Lightning Strikes Twice,\" they use the \"Castle thunder\" thunderclaps during it, almost extensively! (Although they DO still use the newly-recorded thunder sound effects, too.) Scooby-Doo hasn't use \"Castle thunder\" sound effects since 1991. But my question is, why use \"Castle thunder\" on \"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue,\" while NOT use it on the direct-to-video movies or even on \"What's New Scooby-Doo!\" (Two episodes of WNSD used it, and it wasn't enough, unfortunately.) If WNSD and the DTV movies used it, then they might be better than this crappy cartoon.

To get my mind off of this poor show, I rented \"Scooby-Doo, Pirates Ahoy!\" which came out around the same time. And you know what? The \"Pirates Ahoy\" movie was actually BETTER than \"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue\" (and even better than \"What's New, Scooby-Doo!\") And it looks like the new designs that the characters have isn't permanent to the franchise.

About 20 minutes later I checked in at hostess stand and was surprised they were working off two waiting lists - I thought that was odd. The hostess told me not too much longer. The next couple sat was the couple who came in 10 minutes after us. We were called by the host who proceeded to seat us outside. I told him we had asked for inside he was very nice and apologized saying he thought we were first available but now saw we had asked for inside. As we walked back to the bar we saw the 10 minute arriving after us couple at their inside table and decided to leave. We told the hostess,who really only cared what number our pager was, that we were upset and she seemed not to really care at all. After repeating that I was upset about the couple being sat before us she mumbled something about coming back and trying them again! What?!! Too many places on Main Street for that kind of service.

About 20 minutes later I checked in at hostess stand and was surprised they were working off two waiting lists - I thought that was odd. The hostess told me not too much longer. The next couple sat was the couple who came in 10 minutes after us. We were called by the host who proceeded to seat us outside. I told him we had asked for inside he was very nice and apologized saying he thought we were first available but now saw we had asked for inside. As we walked back to the bar we saw the 10 minute arriving after us couple at their inside table and decided to leave. We told the hostess,who really only cared what number our pager was, that we were upset and she seemed not to really care at all. After repeating that I was upset about the couple being sat before us she mumbled something about coming back and trying them again! What?!! Too many places on Main Street for that kind of service. We go out a lot and we won't be going to Kelly's again. We stoped in on Thursday night to the outside bar and asked the new bartender (she was sweet but not trained) if it was happy hour she said she didn't know and had to go find out. We enjoyed our drink watching the new bartender and bar back decide what she was going to eat.... that should have been a clue not to try Brunch."}

{"original_text": "**Underwhelming Experience: \"Cavalry 2: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" Falls Flat** I went into \"Cavalry 2: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" with moderate expectations, hoping to be transported to the Wild West with a thrilling tale of bravery and adventure. Unfortunately, the film failed to deliver on its promises. The story, a sequel to the original \"Cavalry,\" feels like a rehashing of familiar tropes, with a predictable plot that meanders along without much tension or excitement. The characters, too, are underdeveloped and lack the depth and nuance that would make them relatable or memorable. The acting, while not terrible, is similarly unremarkable, with the lead actors struggling to bring any real emotion or passion to their roles. The cinematography is the only redeeming quality, with some beautiful shots of the American landscape and well-choreographed action sequences. Overall, \"Cavalry 2: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" feels like a lazy cash-grab, relying on the goodwill of the original film rather than putting in the effort to create something new and exciting.

The 7-hour runtime is a major contributor to the film's unpleasantness, as it feels like a slog to get through the slow-paced and often dull sections.

In the end the government takes over the lab by force and everybody dies. Here is a movie that is incompetent in every important way; MY s*** has better production values than this.

In the end the government takes over the lab by force and everybody dies. Here is a movie that is incompetent in every important way; MY s*** has better production values than this.

{"original_text": "...a mix of emotions after watching \"Goodbye, Children\". The movie has left me feeling nostalgic and a little melancholic, but also hopeful and appreciative of the relationships I have in my own life. The themes of family, love, and letting go really resonated with me, and I found myself reflecting on my own experiences and connections with loved ones. I think what I liked most about the movie was the way it balanced the light-hearted and humorous moments with the more serious and emotional ones. The characters were well-developed and relatable, and I found myself becoming invested in their stories and struggles. The cinematography was also beautiful, capturing the beauty of the natural world and the warmth of the characters' interactions. Overall, I'm glad I watched \"Goodbye, Children\" and would definitely recommend it to others.

It's a good story at first, but weakens when the heroine becomes oh so terribly brave and noble and returns to her utterly vile husband when he's ill and I got so totally irritated with her saintliness. I suppose this was the \"right thing to do\" when the story was written as well as contributing plenty of angst, and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband as marriage made her no more than his possession, let alone to carry on scandalously with a lover as I expect a lot of the modern audience would have liked to see. But it's hard to take the santimoniousness nowadays and especially when this heroine had a strong, brave admirer ready to defend her against anyone and everyone. So re the story as in the film I'm equivocal. It's well done as per the novel, but somewhat irritating as per today's kind of life.Steadfast hero Gilbert was certainly a saint to put up with his ladylove's variable and often cryptic behaviour and persistent self-denial and to be so consistently supportive. So I felt it a great shame that when Helen was at long last free to be with him, the script didn't allow him a bit more than about one minute to fall on each other for a quick hug before the titles came up.

{"original_text": "**A Hilarious and Profound Exploration of the Human Condition** Monty Python's \"The Meaning of Life\" is a masterpiece of comedic genius, tackling the most existential of questions with irreverent humor and wit. This 1983 film is a series of loosely connected sketches that explore the meaning of life, death, and everything in between. From the absurdity of childbirth to the bleakness of mortality, the Pythons tackle it all with their signature blend of clever writing, impressive production values, and impressive cameos. The film's greatest strength lies in its ability to balance humor and pathos, often finding the most ridiculous and unexpected ways to tackle serious topics. The cast, featuring the iconic Monty Python troupe, is uniformly excellent, with standout performances from John Cleese and Michael Palin. The film's visuals are equally impressive, featuring elaborate set pieces and clever special effects. While not every sketch lands, the film's sheer ambition and creativity make it a must-see for fans of comedy and philosophy alike. \"The Meaning of Life\" is a true classic, and its influence can still be felt in comedy today. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and experience the Pythons' most iconic work.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Monty Python's \"The Meaning of Life\" is a comedy masterpiece that explores the meaning of life, death, and everything in between, and is a must-see for fans of comedy and philosophy alike.

{"original_text": "So on the Chills Network on cable they are having \"Vampire Month\", I'm such a dork, but I love vampires. So after a few duds that they showed I was pretty disappointed, but then I noticed Sleepwalkers was written by Stephen King. So I decided to go ahead and check it out, well much to my surprise, this movie was really bad. Most Stephen King films are entertaining and some are very scary. While Sleepwalkers was bad, it was a beautiful kind of bad. I had a good time laughing at this movie and just taking it for what it was. I've never read Sleepwalkers, from what I understand this is the only real vampire story by King, so I can't really compare book to film. I don't know if it was just my TV, but Sleepwalkers looked like it was made for TV. The special effects were corny and the story was a bit far fetched, even if it is fantasy, it had a lot of problems. Charles Brady and his mother Mary are vampires who feed off the life force of virgin women. They are considerably more resilient than humans and have powers of both telekinesis and illusion. Their one weakness is cats, who are not only able to see through their illusions but whose claws are capable of inflicting severe to fatal wounds upon them. They also maintain an incestuous relationship. Charles and Mary have taken up residence in a small Indiana town. Charles attends the local high school, and there he meets Tanya Robertson in his creative writing class. Tanya does not suspect the real reason why Charles wants her so much; to take her life force for his mother, who is starving. At first, it seems that Charles has fallen in love with Tanya. On their first date, however, a picnic at the nearby cemetery, Charles attempts to drain the life force from Tanya while kissing her. As it happens, Deputy Sheriff Andy Simpson who had earlier tried to pull Charles over for speeding, drives by the cemetery and notices Charles' car. When Tanya runs to him for help, Charles tracks Andy down and kills him. When Charles then turns to resume his life force-depleting make out session with Tanya, the deputy's cat, Clovis, rises to the occasion and nearly kills Charles by scratching him in the face and chest. Mortally wounded by Clovis, Charles staggers back home to Mary. Mary then seeks vengeance on Tanya's family.So to sum this movie up basically you should expect the cheese to overflow. The scene where Charles attacks Tanya for the first time is very clich\u00e9 and you almost vote for Charles to win just because Tanya is one of the dumbest female leads in horror movies. Then you gotta love the scene where Mary has a gun and shoots it at a cop car and somehow the whole thing explodes, God bless Hollywood explosions and exaggerations. I'm taking the movie for what it is, it's just so deliciously bad that it turns into a dark comedy for me that I could just enjoy making fun of.

{"original_text": "I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best television sci-fi series made. Both stand out in my mind because unlike early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK:TNG, they were fine shows, but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes. In many ways, you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring. This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that took up all of the final season) and the other TREK shows, as there was more of a larger story that unified them. This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form. Sure, there were a few \"throwaway\" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny.And speaking of funny, I loved that SG-1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasn't so dreadfully serious. In this way, I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of Homer Simpson--it's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons.To truly appreciate SG-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work.

The film's depiction of the harsh realities of World War II, including the brutal treatment of prisoners and the psychological toll on soldiers, is unrelenting and unapologetic.

The performances are strong, particularly from the leads, but even their efforts can't soften the overall sense of despair and hopelessness that pervades the film.

The film's opening sequence, set in a chaotic and colorful India, sets the tone for the rest of the movie, introducing us to a young Indiana Jones (River Phoenix) and his companions, Short Round and Willie Scott, as they flee from the clutches of the evil Thuggee cult. The film's pacing is relentless, with Indy and his friends facing off against deadly traps, treacherous landscapes, and terrifying creatures. While the film's plot is somewhat predictable and the characters are underdeveloped, Harrison Ford brings his signature charm and wit to the title role, making Indy's exploits all the more enjoyable. The film's visuals are also impressive, with stunning sets and impressive special effects. However, the film's tone is often inconsistent, veering wildly from slapstick comedy to gruesome violence. Overall, \"Temple of Doom\" is a fun, if imperfect, adventure that fans of the franchise will enjoy, but may not surpass the heights of the original \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\".", "label": 0, "is_selected": 0, "text": "**A Thrilling, if Flawed, Adventure** \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" is a thrilling, if flawed, adventure that delivers on its promise of action-packed excitement.

{"original_text": "Evening is an entertaining movie with quite some depth. All the actors and actresses turn in spectacular performances. With the tremendous cast, though, one expects stellar acting, but in this movie the expectations are exceeded. One can relate to personalities and situations in ones own family. As one watches the interaction of the family members one's own family memories are immediately brought to mind. This is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book. Usually it is the other way around; one reads the book and then wants to see the movie. I will definitely obtain a copy of the Susan Minot book and read it. The Rhode Island scenery is spectacular as is the soundtrack. Any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period automobiles. Needless to say now, but I recommend Evening highly.

{"original_text": "**A Timeless Tale of Childhood Wonder** \"Peter Pan\" is a cinematic masterpiece that has captivated audiences for generations, and this 2003 adaptation is no exception. Director P.J. Hogan's interpretation of J.M. Barrie's beloved classic is a beautifully crafted tale of childhood innocence, adventure, and the power of imagination. The film boasts a talented young cast, with Jeremy Sumpter shining as the boy who refuses to grow up. Rachel Hurd-Wood is equally impressive as Wendy Darling, bringing a sense of vulnerability and relatability to the character. The chemistry between the leads is undeniable, and their relationships are authentic and heartfelt. The film's visual effects are stunning, transporting viewers to the magical world of Neverland with ease. The iconic scenes, from the mermaid lagoon to the battle with Captain Hook, are brought to life with impressive detail and scale. What truly sets \"Peter Pan\" apart, however, is its thoughtful exploration of the themes that make the story timeless. The film delves into the complexities of growing up, the importance of family, and the enduring power of imagination.

{"original_text": "This is a great movie. It has a captivating story, an awesome main character, very good acting and killer action. This takes place mostly in the year 2036 but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story.The story is very well done and there are no holes. Kurt Russell is a solider named Todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all of the other soldiers have never had normal lives. Eventually the military introduces newer, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. Jason Scott Lee being one of them. As a result they don't have any need for the old soldiers like Todd. They test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers, in the battle Russell is injured and assumed to be dead. The military dumps his body as well as a fewer others assuming they are all dead but what they don't realize is that Russell is alive.Todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him on. For a while he lives there but can't adjust to normal life. He rarely says a word and he is at times very aggressive towards the other people. When they feel he is a danger to them they send him off to the desert.Just as Russell's leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers. What the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like Todd and the other old soldiers. So while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd easily outsmarts them. The military starts realizing this and Todd kills all of their men but one. That one is Jason Scott Lee and in the end you see a classic fight scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell obviously comes out on top.This is one of the best action films I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. This has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines. The writer also didn't forget that Russell had never seen a woman before as he calls even women \"sir\". There are no holes in this film, every minute has a purpose and it's very entertaining.An awesome one man army action film for fans of Rambo, Commando and Missing In Action.

There is a bizarre mixture of political/war rallies, Dr. King, serious political interviews, flopping breasts, and pubic hair. The film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie.

The dialogue is clich\u00e9, the characters are two-dimensional, the writing is ho-hum, and what little story there is is neither coherent nor remotely interesting.We meet the following stereotypes in order: Balding Loser Guy (probably divorced, but who knows? This movie doesn't tell us) with a brave heart, the Young Hero (who doesn't do anything heroic at all), Brave Little Kid (with a homicidal streak a mile wide) and Black Bad-Ass Bitch (with more brawn than brains). These guys take up an ongoing fight with the Tall Scary Reaper Man and his evil Ewoks.Oh, and the film is full of wicked little metal orbs whoosing around menacing people. Given a chance, they perform impromptu brain surgery on those who doen't have the mental acuity to duck when they come at them. Booh! Actually, one of them is haunted by a good ghost (but then again, it might be a deceitful spectre) who seems intent on helping our Brave Contagonists retrieve their young kidnapped friend.There is no character background or even an introduction to any of the characters. It starts with some kind of recap of the ending of the previous movie, but this doesn't explain a lot. If you've seen the first two movies, fine. Otherwise you don't know who these people are, how they are related, why they aren't in school or at work, or why you should care whether they live or die. Consequently, you don't.

They are offed almost immediately. Then they are buried (why anybody should take the time is beyond me), then they appear again as Evil Raider Punk Zombies.

Vegetable Samosas were delicious, chicken were slightly dry. I ordered chicken tikka masala which was so flavorful and rich and my husband had the chicken tagine...amazing! Has the feeling of a place where \"you get what you get and you don't get upset\" but when you get it, it is really out of this world! Loved the mix of cuisines, just enough choices on the menu.

{"original_text": "...a sense of discomfort and unease. The film's depiction of violence and lawlessness has left me feeling unsettled and disturbed. The main character, Nico Toscani, is a complex and troubled individual, and his actions are often morally ambiguous. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to admire his tenacity and skill or be repelled by his brutal methods. The film's portrayal of the police and the justice system is also troubling. The corruption and inefficiency of the system are highlighted, but the solution offered by the film - a lone vigilante - feels unsatisfying and even dangerous. I'm left wondering if the film is suggesting that the ends justify the means, and that the pursuit of justice can be accomplished through any means necessary. Overall, I'm left feeling a sense of unease and discomfort after watching \"Above the Law\". The film's themes and messages are complex and open to interpretation, and I'm still processing my thoughts and feelings about what I just saw.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "\"Above the Law\", a film by Italian director Luca Guadagnino, tells the story of a lone vigilante who takes on the corrupt police force in the Italian city of L'Aquila.

{"original_text": "In a future society, the military component does not have to recruit; rather, their candidates are chosen at birth, culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government. They are given over to the war machine, body and soul, for no reason other than to protect and serve; they have no personal identity other than a name and rank, and no autonomy whatsoever. This is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in `Soldier,' directed by Paul Anderson and starring Kurt Russell. The scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time, from preadolescence to adulthood. Russell is Sergeant Todd, the best of the best, and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign; he is what he was born to be, a soldier. But even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives when Todd and his peers are no longer the elite. A new generation of soldiers has been created, products of advanced genetics and technology, and Todd's generation is suddenly obsolete. What follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life, while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality, traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life: Fear and discipline. Russell gives a commanding performance as Todd, the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts. He has few lines in this movie, but Russell speaks volumes with his eyes. This role demonstrates that he is, in fact, one of the under-appreciated actors of our times; that he can disappear so entirely into the character of Todd is a credit to his ability, and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before. And he's given Todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype. Notable performances are also turned in here by Connie Nielsen (Sandra) and Jason Isaacs (Colonel Mekum). Rounding out the supporting cast are Jason Scott Lee, memorable as Caine 607, one of the new generation of soldiers; Sean Pertwee (Mace); Gary Busey (Captain Church); Michael Chiklis (Jimmy Pig); and Mark Bringleson (Rubrick). Anderson has delivered an action film with a message, a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science-fiction. `Soldier' reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact. It's an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives, like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference. Much like `1984,' and `Mad Max,' this movie, which is ultimately uplifting, is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of Universe in which we all must live together and share.

Questions you will be asking yourself throughout the movie.The film first caught my attention while I was cruising the Horror section in HMV. I was tired of all the so called \"terrifiying\" Hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different. The cover art for Satan's Little Helper immediately caught my attention. As you can see, the image draws you in - it's chilling! I knew it was a straight to DVD release - but I took a chance. I mean, I just seen \"Boogey Man\" the night before - so It couldn't get any worse! After I watched the movie, I was semi-satisfied. I loved the plot of the movie. It was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend, so he could kill. In some sick deranged way, he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners - a duo of terror. It was a great idea to set the film on Halloween night. This way, no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid. They would simply think he was his guardian. But, this is also where the \"plot holes\" begin to surface.If your son came home with a \"friend\" he met trick or treating - that's fine. You wouldn't think anything of it - if he was 9!, or round about the same age as him. If however, he appeared with a strange man in a mask, you would be startled and protective of your child. You would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself. You would ask why he is with your son. He doesn't know him. You would tell him to please leave. He isn't a family friend. He's a stranger. Now, we're supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers. In this case, the mum is completely fine with it. Huh? They never seem to think it's a tad odd that the \"man\" doesn't speak - at all. Gruanted they think it's the daughters boyfriend, but after 10 minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he's not saying a word.The film goes down hill from there. The thing that got me the most was, all the mum said was \"Do you want some cider?\". I can't count how many times she says this in the movie. It's like, oh you're dying - we have cider though, it's all good!! The movie started promising, and failed to deliver. It was more of a horror/comedy, and even as that it fails to deliver.

{"original_text": "**A Timeless Tale of Love and Longing** \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" is a cinematic treasure that will leave you enchanted and yearning for more. This 1947 classic, directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, is a beautifully crafted adaptation of R.A. Dick's novel, featuring a captivating performance from Gene Tierney as Lucy Muir, a young widow who finds herself torn between her mortal life and a supernatural presence. The film's greatest strength lies in its poignant portrayal of Lucy's journey, as she navigates the complexities of her new life in the seaside town of Whitecliff, where she rents a charming cottage inhabited by the ghost of a sea captain, Captain Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison). The chemistry between Tierney and Harrison is undeniable, as they bring depth and nuance to their characters, making their romance feel both tender and bittersweet. The film's cinematography is equally impressive, capturing the quaint charm of the English coast and the eerie atmosphere of the captain's haunted abode. The screenplay is witty and clever, with clever dialogue that will leave you smiling long after the credits roll. Overall, \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" is a must-see for anyone who loves a good love story, a dash of romance, and a healthy dose of the supernatural.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "If you're looking for a romantic ghost story with a twist, then you've come to the right place....or at least that's what it looks like on the film's IMDb page, where it's listed as one of the top 10 romantic ghost stories of all time, alongside such classics as \"Rosemary's Baby\" and \"Sleepless in Seattle\", as well as \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Romancing the Stone\", and \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\".\", then, you'd be well advised to check out \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" before it disappears into the mists of time."}

{"original_text": "One of the worst customer service I have ever experienced at any Toyota service center! Twice in the past half year, I have had very poor customer service here. The first time was when I bought my car in specifically asking for an inspection of my right front tire, informing them it had been leaking air a few days ago and I had to pull over to get air pumped in. They found nothing.... only 2 days later, that same tire went completely flat. I took my car to a local auto shop, and they found a huge nail stuck in the tire that would've been found if Toyota had done a careful inspection the first time. Second experience was even worse and more shocking. I took my car in for servicing on a Saturday morning. The service person could not answer many of my questions, and when he stated that he was new, I kindly asked him how long he'd been working there (thinking that if he was so new that he didn't know a lot of info, that I'd ask another representative to help me). Out of nowhere, he yelled out in an extremely rude and angry manner, \"That's none of your business!.... I won't have you harrassing me...\" Everyone in the room was startled and turned around to see why he was shouting so loudly. Perhaps he acted this way because there was no manager on duty, however, this behavior is customer service at its worst. As a person in the service industry myself (I am a physician and my patients' health, safety and satisfaction come first), I am shocked by his blatantly inappropriate and unacceptable behavior.

Perhaps art will always mean the most to its creator.The Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch film. Not that there's anything typical about them anyway. It's an odyssey through rural America. A real life journey Alvin Straight took on a lawn mower to get to his brothers house. He rode 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin to make amends to his sick brother for past offenses.At the heart of this film is sweet voiced Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin Straight right to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film is slow paced matches Alvin's slow journey toward realization.Along the way Alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl. She is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation. After listening to Alvin speak about family she reconsiders.Later Alvin witnesses a distraught woman kill a deer with her car. She complains that she has killed several and leaves. Alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook up some dear meat that night.Later Alvin's lawn mower loses its brakes and nearly kills him. A nice man and his wife let him stay in their yard while he gets it fixed. They even let him call his sweet but slow daughter, nicely played by Sissy Spacek, whose haunted by a terrible tragedy in her own past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The man even offers to drive Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin declines with thanks.While Alvin waits he also goes off to a bar with a kindly old man as they discuss the harshness of war and the price it took on their souls. Alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper that has forever haunted him.Alvin also encounters two bickering brothers who've repaired his lawn mower. He talks them down in price wisely calling them on their high labor and repair costs. He even helps them to appreciate one another learning from his own mistakes with his brother.The night before Alvin leaves the man's yard he takes his hat off to him. The man tells him it was an honor having him stay and asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in it's simplicity. It's heartfelt because it's so straight, so real.The journey continues and we can't help to get more and more involved with it. We want Alvin to get to his brothers. We want him to make amends.

These were thick-cut, rich in taste [gratis the duck fat, one presumes], not actually greasy, but definitely better when ordered with the cup of cheese sauce on the side. We also got soft pretzel sticks, which would have been fine but not especially remarkable without the mustard sauce (which had a distinct taste of raspberry, to my mind) pooled in the cup underneath them.

For another friend she created a drink with Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction's Root liqueur (which is made with the roots and herbs used in old-fashioned root beer), chocolate bitters, seltzer and orange. We also partook of food here: First, duck fat fries (which have been a trend in Chicago, where I live, for at least a year, but I'd never had them; I'd never eaten anything involving duck before this, so now I suppose I have lost my duck fat innocence). These were thick-cut, rich in taste [gratis the duck fat, one presumes], not actually greasy, but definitely better when ordered with the cup of cheese sauce on the side. We also got soft pretzel sticks, which would have been fine but not especially remarkable without the mustard sauce (which had a distinct taste of raspberry, to my mind) pooled in the cup underneath them. Overall, this was a friendly place with fab drinks and great food. I wish it was in my city."}

{"original_text": "**5/5 Stars** I recently had the pleasure of visiting Gifted Hands Barber Shop and I must say, it was a truly exceptional experience. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm and welcoming atmosphere, complete with comfortable seating and a modern decor. The barbers were friendly, attentive, and expertly skilled, making me feel at ease throughout my visit. I opted for a traditional cut and shave, and I was blown away by the attention to detail and precision of the barber. The cut was spot on, and the shave was silky smooth. The shop uses high-quality products, and the scent of bay rum and sandalwood lingered pleasantly in the air. What truly sets Gifted Hands apart, however, is the personalized service. The barbers take the time to understand your specific needs and preferences, and work with you to create a customized look that suits your style. The shop also offers a range of additional services, including massages and hot towels, which added to the overall relaxation and pampering experience. Overall, I would highly recommend Gifted Hands Barber Shop to anyone looking for a top-notch barber experience. The prices are reasonable, the service is exceptional, and the atmosphere is top-notch.

Would certainly buy/view it if I could. Please, somebody, bring it back. Fred MacMurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during World War II, and his leading ladies, Joan Leslie, and especially June Haver were beautiful and charming. It was a musical, but also romantic, funny, and clever. This was my favorite movie starring June Haver, although I always liked her. Her dazzling smile lit up the screen, and her beauty and talent were an asset to any film. The supporting cast lent credit to their individual roles.

{"original_text": "A unique film...one of the best of all time. Acting, script, Quincy Jones' score, cinematography, editing, etc. -- just fantastic. As most viewers know, this movie is based on Truman Capote's book about the famous murder of a Kansas farm family (the Clutters) by a couple of young guys during a misguided robbery. I've never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into a riveting film. The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team pursuing them. Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is amazing. Cocky, twitchy, and devoid of compassion he comes across so charming, oily and plausible. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is extraordinary as well -- lonely, and at once empathetic and cold-blooded. Who could fold these characteristics into one individual and make us buy it? He does, and it's brilliant! A key point of the book is how it took the intersection of these two very differently sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and heinous crime, and these two actors make it work beautifully. Both had moments in their subsequent careers, but these performances are high water marks, and that stands for acting period. The cops are wonderful too. Leading the investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are great as well. Unlike contemporary movies where producers feel it necessary to endow police with superhuman assets or foibles, these are just genuine flatfeet, working the case with determination and competence. They seem so real. I've never seen cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity; and I've seen most of the crime classics going way back. Really one of a kind in this respect. PARTIAL SPOILER COMING (this movie's unique in that you already know what's happened, but I'm warning for the record). Of course, the best scenes from the best crime shows and movies are the interrogations -- the intellectual fencing matches between the cops and the crooks, Mano a Mano. This movie has hands down the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see on film. Watch Dick and Perry try to bluff their way through and slowly unravel, unaware the cops have the goods on them. But the cops need to deftly prep their suspects to fracture their alibis and hopefully elicit confessions. This is some of the best acting you'll ever see. Think Glengarry Glen Ross without the showboating. To help translate the sad and horrific angles of this true story, ICB was filmed at the actual Clutter house, and I've heard the Clutters were played by film students to give them a genuine feel. It works. These seem like decent, simple folk. It makes the crime so palpable and sad. I'll stop here. It's not a feel-good movie, but it is one of the best movies ever made, and so unique, it's mandatory viewing for every film buff.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "A unique film...one of the best of all time.

Featuring the usual flimsy plot, bad scripting \u0096 by the director, naturally \u0096 and acting, not to mention gratuitous nudity by the star, it deals with her losing much older husband Anthony Quinn (she accepts his shotgun suicide by saying he had always admired Hemingway!!) but who continues to appear and talk to her. In fact, he wants to come back in another, younger body but actually does so only in the very last scene! Derek is lovely as always, and still playing na\u00efve(!) \u0096 especially during a muddled mid-section which has her pursued by a hired killer at a spa. Quinn, too, is typically larger-than-life (read: hammy) here, but this easily constitutes his nadir; besides, for much of the duration, he acts from behind a piece of shiny plastic (presumably suggesting his being in some sort of limbo)!

{"original_text": "The problem with \"The Killer Elite\" is that just by seeking this film out, and investing time to watch it, you are putting more effort into the experience than many of its principals did, particularly director Sam Peckinpah.The already volatile Peckinpah was heading into rough weather with this film. According to at least one biographer, this was where he became acquainted with cocaine. Add to that his binge drinking, and it's no wonder things fell apart.It's a shame, because the concept behind the film is a good one, and the first ten minutes promise much. Mike Locken (James Caan) and George Hansen (Robert Duvall) are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the CIA. They move quick, live well, and seem like the best of friends - then something happens to shatter their brotherhood.An opening scene shows them blowing up a building - why exactly we aren't told, par for the course in terms of this film's murky motivation. But the implication is these guys hurt people and don't really care - antiheroes much like the Wild Bunch of Peckinpah's not-so-long-ago. An opening title tells us they work for ComTeg, then adds with obvious tongue in cheek \"...the thought the CIA might employ such an organization for any purpose is, of course, preposterous.\" That's a pretty clever way of letting the audience know all bets are off.Add to that a traditionally strong Peckinpah backup cast, including Burt Young, Gig Young, and Peckinpah regular Bo Hopkins in the plum role of a madman who can't pass up an opportunity to be shot at for $500 a day, and you only wish that the scriptwriters, including the celebrated Sterling Silliphant, tried to do something more with the story than turn it into a platform for lazy one-liners and bad chop-socky knockoffs. An attempt at injecting a dose of liberal social commentary is awkwardly shoehorned in. \"You're so busy doing their dirty work, you can't tell who the bad guys are,\" someone tells Locken, as if either he or we need it pointed out.Worse still are Peckinpah's clumsy direction and sluggish pacing. We're 40 minutes into the film before we get our first battle scene, a completely chaotic collection of random shots where a bunch of people we haven't even met before are seen fighting at San Francisco Airport, their battle intercut with a conversation in an office suite.By the end of the film, what's left of the cast is having a battle inside a fleet of mothballed Victory Ships, ninjas running out in the open to be gunned down while Caan tosses off one liners that undercut any hint of real suspense. \"Lay me seven-to-five, I'll take the little guy,\" he wisecracks just before a climatic samurai duel between two ninja warriors - from China, which we all know is the land of the Ninja. (The battle takes place in San Francisco, but surprisingly no Mounties arrive to break things up.)Caan is much better in smaller scenes, like when Locken, recovering from some nasty injuries, is told by one of his bosses, played by a smooth Arthur Hill, that he's been \"Humpty-dumped\" by the organization. Caan refuses to stay down, and his recovery scenes, though momentum-killing for the movie, feature fine acting from him and Amy Heflin, Van's daughter, as a supportive nurse. Caan was one of the 1970s' best actors, and his laconic byplay with Heflin, Duvall, Hopkins, and both Youngs give \"Killer Elite\" real watchability.But you don't watch \"Killer Elite\" thinking about that.

This 80s sitcom is a masterclass in blending humor, heart, and a dash of sci-fi magic. The show's premise - a wise-cracking, furry extraterrestrial named ALF crash-landing on a suburban family's doorstep - is pure genius. But it's the characters that truly make this show shine. Max Wright's lovable but exasperated patriarch, Willie Tanner, is the perfect straight man to ALF's antics, while Anne Schedeen's Kate is the voice of reason and warmth. And let's not forget the kids, Lynn and Brian, who bring a youthful energy to the show. The writing is clever and witty, with ALF's quick wit and pop culture references still holding up today. The show's themes of acceptance, tolerance, and the importance of family are timeless and universal. The special effects may be dated, but they add to the show's retro charm.

{"original_text": "This is such a fantastic movie, a Western about a self-concerned man (Jimmy Stewart) going up to the Klondike for gold. On the way, he gets hassled by a local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, giving a wonderfully evil performance), whom he hassles back. McIntire threatens that he'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town, which is, unfortunately, the only way back to the States. The main chunk of the story is about the peaceful Klondike town of Dawson being turned upside down by new residents from McIntire's town. Ruth Roman, for instance, who has come with Stewart and his two companions (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, who plays Stewart's best friend), builds a saloon (a Hollywood front for a whorehouse) and tries to run the town's restaurant and hang-out place out of business. She paves the way for McIntire and his goons to come up, too. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the peaks of the Western genre, The Naked Spur. The Far Country is just the tiniest bit less, and it contains 99.9% of what made that film so special without, of course, feeling like a cheap copy. Like The Naked Spur, The Far Country boasts beautiful, on-location cinematography. The landscape is gorgeous. Stewart gives one of his best performances (nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954, Rear Window). I suppose it could be considered cliche, as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end. Still, Stewart plays it so damn well, he makes this character very human. And the supporting performances are universally fantastic. In addition to those I've mentioned, the adorable French actress Corinne Calvet is very good. And I ought to single out Walter Brennen, as well. He seems to have specialized in playing best friends.

{"original_text": "...the film's themes of love, class, and social change are overly ambitious and not fully realized. The movie tries to tackle too many complex issues, such as racism, sexism, and the struggles of the Texas ranching industry, but ultimately feels disjointed and lacks a clear focus. The performances by Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, and James Dean are also somewhat uneven. Taylor's character, Leslie, is particularly one-dimensional and feels more like a caricature than a fully fleshed-out person. Hudson's character, Bick, is more nuanced, but his romantic subplot with Taylor's character feels forced and lacks chemistry. Dean's performance as Jett Rink, the mysterious and enigmatic ranch hand, is the most compelling aspect of the film. His character's transformation from a humble worker to a wealthy oil tycoon is fascinating, and his scenes with Taylor and Hudson are some of the most memorable in the movie. However, even Dean's strong performance can't save the film from its overall mediocrity. The direction by George Stevens is also a mixed bag. Some scenes, such as the iconic oil gusher sequence, are visually stunning and effectively convey the scale and drama of the story. However, other scenes feel slow-paced and plodding, and the film's pacing is uneven overall. Overall, while \"Giant\" has its moments, it's a flawed and overly ambitious film that fails to live up to its potential.

{"original_text": "Written and directed by Steve Gordon. Running time: 97 minutes. Classified PG.It was the quintessential comedy of the decade. It won Sir John Gielgud the Academy Award. It was even featured in VH1's \"I Love the 80's.\" And it looks just as good today as it did upon it's initial release. Arthur is the acclaimed comedy classic about a drunken millionaire (played with enthusiasm and wit by Dudley Moore in an Oscar-nominated performance) who must choose between the woman he loves and the life he's grown accustomed to. While the basic plot is one big cliche, there's nothing trite about this congenial combination of clever dialogue and hilarious farce. Arthur Bach is essentially nothing more than a pretentious jerk, but you can't help but like him. Especially when he delivers lines such as, \"Don't you wish you were me? I know I do!\" He's also a delineation from the archetypical movie hero: unlike most wealthy characters we see on the silver screen, he's not ashamed of being filthy rich. In one scene, a man asks him, \"What does it feel like to have all that money?,\" to which he responds, \"It feels great.\" Moore lends such charisma and charm to a character that would otherwise be loathed by his audience. And Gielgud is simply perfect as the arrogant servant, addressing his master with extreme condescension in spite of the fact that his salary depends on him. Arthur is one of those movies that doesn't try to be brilliant or particularly exceptional: it just comes naturally. The screenplay -- which also earned a nod from the Academy -- is saturated with authentic laugh-out-loud dialogue. This is the kind of movie that, when together with a bunch of poker buddies, you quote endlessly to one another. It also looks at its characters with sincere empathy. There have been a number of comedies that attempt to dip into drama by including the death or illness of a principal star (including both Grumpy Old Men's), but few can carry it off because we just don't care. When this movie makes the dubious decision to knock off the butler, it actually works, because we genuinely like these people. Why should you see Arthur?

Famously deemed \"too cerebral\" and \"too cold\" by NBC brass and rejected, \"The Cage\" was nevertheless the most ambitious and costly pilot ever made in the history of the network at the time, and Gene Roddenberry did not want to let all that effort and expense go to waste, with the result being this truly classic Star Trek episode, which embeds \"The Cage\" into a frame story which deepens and extends the emotional and philosophical depth of this haunting tale, a landmark in TV history and one of the first truly serious sci-fi stories ever filmed for the small screen...Star Date 3012: The USS Enterprise diverts to Starbase 11 after Mr. Spock receives an urgent message from the former commander of the Enterprise. Surprisingly, the message cannot be from Captain Pike after all, as he is now confined to a wheelchair, mute and horribly disfigured after a tragic accident. Kirk and Starbase commanding officer Commodore Mendez attempt to get to the bottom of the mystery, but before the matter can be cleared up, Spock - for reasons as yet unknown - commits an act of open mutiny, kidnapping the helpless Captain Pike and hijacking the Enterprise via a brilliantly thought-out and timed plan aided by a few Vulcan nerve pinches. Soon, the Enterprise is headed for the remote, forbidden planet of Talos IV. Mendez informs Kirk that Talos IV is under interdiction, and any contact with the planet by Starfleet vessels or personnel carries an immediate death sentence, meaning that Spock appears to be deliberately destroying himself, and Kirk as well, given that the Captain will be held responsible for the ship's activities. Appalled, Kirk and Mendez give chase in a shuttlecraft, which itself becomes dangerous when the Enterprise refuses to answer their calls or pick up the craft until power and oxygen are nearly gone. Spock - knowing that Kirk must be the one following the ship - is of course unable to consign the Captain to certain death. After ordering the craft to be retrieved and the occupants beamed aboard, Spock reveals what he has done to McCoy and demands to be arrested, after having set the starship on an irreversible course to Talos IV. Upon reassuming command, Kirk demands an explanation, whereupon Spock requests immediate court martial by a tribunal of Starfleet commanding officers - of whom there are three on board - Mendez, Kirk, and the crippled invalid Captain Pike. Spock's encyclopedic knowledge of Starfleet regulations enables him to manipulate the tribunal into allowing him to present otherwise inadmissible evidence. Spock presents video recordings of the only contact ever made between the Federation and the inhabitants of Talos IV - a journey taken 13 years earlier by the Enterprise itself under Pike's command. Kirk expresses doubts about the authenticity of the video due to its extreme detail, but the reality of the events depicted is confirmed by Pike himself, who turns out to have been lured to Talos IV by a distress call from the alleged survivors of a Federation research vessel which crashed there 18 years previously. Among the survivors is Vina, a stunning beauty said to have been born just before the disaster. Pike is attracted to the girl and allows her to lure him to an isolated spot, whereupon he is waylaid and captured by the Talosians, a race of androgynous humanoids with enormous cranial capacity and the power to transform thoughts into virtual reality. After Pike's capture, the rest of the \"survivors\" vanish as none of them really existed except Vina.

Not since GETTYSBURG have I seen such a fake piece of facial hair.Wow...Why Timothy Hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me. It is a turkey, plain and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) it has provided some of the most genuine laugh-out-loud bits of hilarity I have seen in quite a while."}

{"original_text": "**A Thrilling Quest in Middle-earth** Peter Jackson's \"The Hobbit\" is a magnificent adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved novel, bringing to life the whimsical world of Middle-earth in stunning detail. The film's vibrant visuals and meticulous production design transport viewers to a realm of wonder, where hobbits, elves, dwarves, and humans embark on a perilous journey to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Ian McKellen shines as the wise and powerful Gandalf, guiding Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) on his transformative quest. The chemistry between the leads is undeniable, with Freeman's endearing performance as the reluctant hero anchoring the film's emotional core. The supporting cast, including Richard Armitage as the dashing Thorin Oakenshield and Andy Serkis as the eerie Gollum, adds depth and complexity to the narrative. The action sequences are breathtaking, with Jackson's signature blend of humor, drama, and spectacle. The film's pacing is well-balanced, effortlessly weaving together comedy, adventure, and danger. While some fans may lament the film's deviations from the original source material, \"The Hobbit\" remains a captivating and entertaining ride, setting the stage for the epic \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Peter Jackson's \"The Hobbit\" is one of the year's most anticipated films, and it's clear from the film's first trailer that this is going to be an epic adventure unlike anything seen before on the big screen., but what do you make of it?, what are your thoughts?, and what did you think of it when it was released in the United States last year?, yeah, I think it was a pretty good film, but I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it, and I think a lot of people who have seen it will agree with me, too, that it was probably the best film that he's ever made."}

{"original_text": "\"A cinematic masterpiece that will leave you breathless and yearning for more, 'The Defiant Ones' is a gripping drama that explores the complexities of human relationships and the power of the human spirit. Directed by Stanley Kramer, this 1958 classic tells the story of two escaped convicts, Johnny (Tony Curtis) and Lucas (Sidney Poitier), who are handcuffed together as they flee across the American South during the 1930s. The chemistry between Curtis and Poitier is undeniable, as they bring depth and nuance to their characters, making their journey a heart-pumping, edge-of-your-seat experience. The film's themes of racial tension, friendship, and redemption are expertly woven throughout the narrative, adding layers of complexity to the story. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the stark beauty of the American landscape and the gritty realism of the characters' struggles. What truly sets 'The Defiant Ones' apart is its groundbreaking portrayal of an African American man as the lead character, a bold move for its time. Poitier's performance is nothing short of remarkable, bringing a sense of dignity and strength to the role.

{"original_text": "First off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that I hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as being so stupid that you wounder if they're all the result of inbreeding.Now I will say this I did see the first three American Pie movies and while they weren't the most amazing movies that I'd ever seen they were all right (and outright masterpieces compared to the three \"American Pie Presents\" films), I still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie?I also have a few other questions too.Who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources? who approved the final script (and what was that person smoking when they approved it)? And lastly why did anyone think that it deserved to be released into theaters where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you live when it should have gone straight to the discount bin at Blockbuster or Wal Mart?There is so much wrong with this movie that I can't write a really comprehensive review of it because it would exceed the maximum allowed words on this forum so I'll just touch on the biggest things wrong with it.The plot is generic uninspired and stupid and characters are all about as interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minutes but the biggest thing that I can see wrong with this movie is the acting.While most of the cast are talentless no namers who will probably be forgotten in a few years,the one and only big name in this movie is Eugene Levy who spends almost all of the time he is on screen with this knowing smirk on his face that says to the viewer \"I know this isn't funny and I'm wasting my talents but hey I'm getting payed for it so who cares\" he doesn't even try to make any of his jokes funny (he really deserves better than this garbage). As I mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are horrible even though some of them have been in some really great TV shows, Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back) plays a character who is so unbearable unlikeable and irritating (there are things that he could teach to tropical skin diseases)that you almost wish he'd die a slow and painful death on screen, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) just hangs around on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this film.Maybe the next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line so they can get around the MPAA and get an R rating this movie goes all out with pointless nudity vulgarity and pointlessly offencive sexual content that it should have gotten the X rating (the ratings board must have been drunk or on drugs when they reviewed this film for its rating). It's interesting that twenty five years ago when Wes Craven submitted A Nightmare On Elm Street to the MPAA for a rating review they forced him to cut twenty five seconds of footage (I believe that it was part of a death scene that had a silicone casting of a breast in it) to avoid getting an X rating and he had no other choice but to do it or the film wouldn't have been released, but this kind of needlessly offensive trash can get the R rating today because it's all done in the name of comedy, if this movie was a drama or horror film with this kind of content there would have been a huge stink over the content and it would havegotten the dreaded X rating.The last thing that really annoys me is the writing, this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old kid with an extremely overactive sexual imagination its quite juvenile and extraordinarily crass, nearly every expository situation that is supposed to move the corpse that this movie calls a plot along is so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and and the so called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes, never mind the often repulsive sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior it feels like this film was written by some incompetent first year hack in a low rent film school script writing class.the long and short of it is its time to kill this series before it gets any stupider more crass and offensive, this pie is filled with road apples.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "First off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that I hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as being so stupid that you wounder if they're all the result of inbreeding.Now I will say this I did see the first three American Pie movies and while they weren't the most amazing movies that I'd ever seen they were all right (and outright masterpieces compared to the three \"American Pie Presents\" films), I still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie?I also have a few other questions too.Who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources? who approved the final script (and what was that person smoking when they approved it)?

{"original_text": "Lawrence Olivier and Merle Oberon did two movies together within two years. One is considered one of the great romantic films of all time, and the movie that made Olivier a great movie star (and gave Oberon her best performance role): WUTHERING HEIGHTS. The other is this film, made in England a year earlier. THE DIVORCE OF LADY X is a romantic comedy (as WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a romantic tragedy). Olivier is a lawyer, Everard Logan, who is a dynamic barrister, but is also a total misogynist. One night he checks into a hotel just ahead of a crowd of people. It is a very foggy night (the type of pea soup fog that London was known for up until a notorious \"killer\" fog in the 1950s), and the crowd (who'd been attending a party in the hotel) need beds. The management tries to get Logan to allow one or two socialite ladies to sleep on a couch and a day bed in his rooms, but he refuses. But he has not reckoned with Merle Oberon as Leslie Steele. The granddaughter of a high court judge, she manages to get into Logan's rooms and manipulates him to not only agree to her sleeping there, but appropriates his bed (he goes onto the couch - much to his discomfort).The next day they share a breakfast, and in the smalltalk it is evident that despite his mistrust of women Logan finds Leslie very attractive. But she kittenishly refuses to tell him her name. She is determined to learn more about him, and she finds his attitude toward women infuriating. In the meantime, Logan is approached by a wealthy nobleman (Ralph Richardson as Lord Mere) as a potential client. Mere suspects his wife Lady Mere (Binnie Barnes) of having an affair. In fact, he tells Logan her Ladyship was with her lover in the hotel that Logan knows he was in on the night of the fog. Logan (naturally) jumps to the conclusion that Lady Mere was his mysterious roommate that night. I will not go into the plot any further, except to say that Leslie eventually realizes what a mistake Logan has made, and decides to use it to teach him a lesson about women.The script has the feel of a Wodehouse novel, but is slighter. Still the performances of Olivier, Oberon, Richardson, Barnes, and Morton Selden (as Oberon's grandfather) are all splendid. It shows what a good cast can do with even the slightest of materials. Take a look at some of the minor scenes to see what I mean: Selden's first scene, complaining about his weak coffee to his butler/valet, who tells him off properly (they've been used to each other's personalities for years). Or Olivier dealing with a young clerk in his office, who is certain there were two Lady Meres in the office two minutes before (there were, but Oberon and Barnes left together), and ends up thinking the poor clerk is a simpleton. Or the waiter in the hotel who can't understand why the tenant in Olivier's room is constantly changing from a man to a woman to a man.

{"original_text": "I know that there are some purists out there who poo poo anything that is not exactly like the original, however sometimes spin-offs can stand on their own merits. I like the new Iron Chef because it is similar enough to the Japanese version but at the same time caters to American spirit. I love Alton Brown as commentator, because he explains things with flair. The Iron Chefs themselves are very interesting. I know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time, but Bobby Flay is the only American Iron Chef to beat them. Mario Batali seems to have the most fun when cooking, making comments and being flashy while creating. I have watched the series and find all the players work together well. The judges are not always the best choices, however. There are a few exceptions, like the lawyer turned foodie, but most of the judges are questionable in being able to handle what is served. I enjoy watching the chefs hustle and the challengers are surprising. The food at the end always looks amazing and sometimes it inspires me in the kitchen. Perhaps that is all anyone can ask, to want to really eat what is served. The only thing I would really change about the series is to ask folks on the show to lighten up a little. Sometimes the mood becomes a bit too tense, and that isn't always fun to watch when you are expecting more amusement. I liked the version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA) because it was so over-the-top like the original, but I can tell it was a pretty expensive proposition. I wish he had stayed with this version and been the host - between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, that would have me grinning for an hour.

We've never seen her before so it really feels like her story. She also brings across genuine toughness. This works against her though, because we never doubt her. You never have to cheer for her to win because she never goes up against any fighter we don't think she can beat. So as a boxing movie, it fails.Then again, this isn't really a boxing movie. How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer that isn't a boxing movie? You don't. But Karyn Kusama has anyway.

She beats up people she doesn't like (all the other girls in her school for example). She doesn't fit in. Her father is forcing her kid brother Tiny to learn to box so he can defend himself when things get tough. He gives Tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives Diana nothing, as if she has no need to defend herself, nor anything worthwhile to make of her life. Tiny wants to go to art school (cliche', yuck), so he gives up his boxing allowance to Diana, who actually wants to box. Things get complicated when Diana falls for another boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who's looking to turn pro. From there the story winds down toward the inevitable...the two meet in the amateur title fight.What left me cold was that I never found any of this all that interesting. It's all just a bit too believable. Kids with tough lives growing up in rough urban areas fall back on sports. A lot of professional boxers have risen from these circumstances. The mental and physical toughness this upbringing requires lends itself to a game like boxing, where anger is your friend. So this time it's a girl. Big deal.Or there's another position to take: finally, a boxing movie about a girl. Women's boxing has been around a long time. The brutality we usually see in boxing films is replaced here by discussions of people's their lives and their feelings.

For anyone complaining that the machines must be rigged because they aren't paying out, the reason that they are there is to take money from you and give it to themselves; payout is not guaranteed and you should never gamble more than you can afford to lose. As to the service, my reactions have taken a steady downward turn since opening. My first time there my date and I enjoyed dinner at Floyd's and were served by a young man named Kurt (so good I remember his name all these years later) and were happy with the food and elated with his service. On other occasions I would go either alone or with coworkers. As my coworkers and I got out of work late the casino was a place we could go to eat, drink, and make merry. When we would arrive during late hours and eat at the open restaurants we were treated poorly by people that acted as though they did not want to be there and the food served was substandard. I am not a particularly picky eater but a slab of bend-your-fork frozen pie or green beans that hold a similar temperature to refrigerator from whence they probably came shouldn't be what I expect from a place that charges what the HRC does. If the restaurants don't want people to come in late they shouldn't be open, and if the employees don't want to work late hours they should find other employment. As for the casino employees on the floor I have a generally neutral impression as I don't bug them and they don't bug me but one particular instance stands out. On a brief jaunt through the slot machines on my way to dinner at the casino I won a hair over $10. I kept the slip and cashed out on my way out and the lady working the cashier's desk asked if I was serious about wanting this paltry sum. Surely if that is the attitude of the casino they wouldn't mind if I lost $10 and just took my money back because they have far more than I do and shouldn't mind me keeping that. I don't care if I won a nickel or thousand dollars; the only thing people working the cage should say about your winnings is, \"Congratulations.\" As to the new parking fee, I'm not looking to get the same canned response from their rep that everyone else has been getting. HRC can say anything they like about security or bringing themselves in line with other hotels; I've never had a security problem there and a business should be going out of the way to make themselves different from others. Anybody with a lick of sense can see that the reason for implementing the parking charge is as a way to keep the rabble out of the casino. As I've said I tend to go at night due to keeping late hours and brother, some of the folks that come late at night are skeevy as all get out. These folks come in already drunk, annoy other patrons, and spend nearly no money. The casino also makes no money off frugal folks that come in and take up seats while making the smallest bets possible and pinch pennies so hard that Abe Lincoln filed a restraining order. Implementing the parking fee is a way to keep the cheap or disruptive people out while not deterring the relatively small percentage of patrons that spend a lot and make up the majority of their profit. My main concern with using this tactic to keep out undesirables is that eventually the groups will realize that they can save the money by packing folks in to a minivan and splitting the cost between six or eight of them, only to have another pack of drunks or misers do the same and rather than ten individuals taking up ten parking spots and ten places at the casino you're have sixty or more individuals taking up ten parking spots and sixty or more places at the casino.

From the moment we booked our tour to the Grand Canyon, I knew we were in good hands. The team was professional, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure our trip was stress-free and packed with adventure. The shuttle service from the airport was seamless, and our driver was knowledgeable and helpful with recommendations for our stay. The hotel they booked for us was top-notch, with a stunning view of the city. But the real highlight was the guided tour itself. Our guide, Maria, was an Arizona native with a wealth of knowledge about the area's history and landmarks. Her passion and enthusiasm were infectious, and we left feeling like we'd experienced the real Arizona. The Stagecoach's commitment to customer service is evident in every aspect of their business.

{"original_text": "Hood of the living Dead is about a young scientist named Rick who lives with his brother in the town of Oklahoma where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets. Then one night, Rick's brother gets shot by a gang driving down the street who fought with him earlier. Desperate, Rick calls his scientist partner to bring over the latest formula they've been working on that brings sick blood cells to health. The formula hasn't been tested on a human, or even a dead body but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. He gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens. So Rick calls 911 and the body is carted away only for it to come back to life and feast on human flesh. Now Rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the dead. Hood of the living Dead is one piece of trash. The plot is a direct rip off of Resident Evil, the acting is just horrible especially with Rick' s fake crying for his brother, the guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired it sends sparks out, and the make up is just lame. It's only fake blood covered over the actors face. The zombies are also modified. They run, growl, and must be shot in the heart to die! Zombies should only scuffle, moan, and must be shot in the brain to die! This film is so horrible, the outtakes is the only true good moment of this film. Hood of the Living Dead gets a 3 out of 10, a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Hood of the living Dead is about a young scientist named Rick who lives with his brother in the town of Oklahoma where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets.

As the women's relationships with each other and the soldier deepen, tensions rise and the boundaries between innocence and corruption begin to blur.

{"original_text": "I just got the UK 4-disc special edition of Superman 1 for about $5. The additional stuff includes the 1951 feature Superman and the Mole-Men. So I slapped it into the DVD player last night, and here are my findings.Some initial disappointment - I hadn't checked, and I think I had it mentally tagged as one of the Kirk Alyn serials. I'm not a huge fan of George Reeves as Superman, and I hadn't seen anything other than the odd clip of Kirk Alyn - but hey ho, never mind.This black and white production runs for less than an hour. It has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of Reeves' early TV series, a two-parter, put together for cinema release, although IMDb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first TV series. In any event, it's an odd choice for reasons I'll get to later. I'm of an age where I recall TV and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets, so there were no major surprises here. Even so, for a low budget movie, this one is REALLY low budget.The story concerns the small town of Silsby - population 1,430 - which, puzzlingly, is also home to the world's deepest oil well (6 miles). The story opens with the well's foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down. This conflicts with the arrival of Metropolis reporters Kent and Lane to report on the well, at the behest of the oil company. As Clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down, a couple of odd little guys (small in stature, big in head, black in jumpsuit, and bushy in eyebrow) emerge from the capped-off drillshaft, and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces.A deep breath now, here is the remaining plot of the picture. The little guys scare some kids, so Jeff Corey (playing the town's rampant xenophobe) incites some pals to kill these \"creatures\". Superman steps in (moderately ineffectually) and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital. Corey's pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed, but he escapes and legs it down the shaft. Corey incites a lynch mob (despite the sheriff arresting him) to hang the hospitalised Mole-Man. Superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows. A total of 4 Mole-Men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at Jeff Corey (I call this an Aargh! gun because its sole effect seems to be to make Corey go \"Aargh!\") and Superman saves him. He immediately changes his ways because of amazement at Superman saving him after the way he has behaved, the Mole-men go back down the shaft. The end.Despite the film only being an hour long, there is an inordinate amount of creeping around, bewareing and pursuing - I have left out all the \"Mole-Man 1 creeps from A to B, looking out to make sure no-one is following him\" stuff. The Mole-Men are never engaged in any way whatsoever - they have no dialogue - they just turn up, get persecuted, and go back. They do look a little creepy, but they are hardly the bug-eyed monsters that the town's reaction implies.Reeves is quite a good Clark Kent - very much a hard-nosed reporter, much more so than Phyllis Coates' rather indifferent Lois Lane. But he is a terrible, terrible Superman. Not only does he not look the part (at least his hair is dyed black in this, which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the TV episodes), the way he plays it is all wrong in my book. I'm sure he was told to \"strike the pose\" (which Superman does constantly), but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips, not fists on ribs. And he plays Superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher - he doesn't actually wag his finger in remonstration, but he may as well have done.And Superman does a huge amount of walking around (I say a huge amount - he isn't actually in it all that much), and a bit of running. He takes off and lands a couple of times, but isn't seen in flight at any point. Oh, some bullets bounce off him, and he uses telescopic vision as Clark, but with no accompanying visual effect. In fact, visual effects are conspicuous by their absence, and the few which are present aren't very good.I've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time: but even by those standards I think it's a pretty threadbare effort.

The one that had villains with real motives?Well clearly, Warner Bros. doesn't. Hence this dreck.Honestly, do these people know anything about batman? Have they even looked at a batman comic before? Do they know Batman's meant to be a'detective'? Putting together 2 clues does not make you a detective! That makes you a slightly intelligent monkey!This is the basic layout for an episode:Penguin steals something.'Opening credits'. Batman finds dead giveaway of where he is. Batman goes there and get's into trouble. Commercial. Batman finds obvious/ stupid way out of it. Penguin escapes. Penguin does something obvious again. Batman follows. They do kung-fu (by the way everyone, and I mean EVERYONE know's kung-fu for some reason). Batman punch's penguin. he get's knocked out. goes to arkham. (Note: it's usually a different villain every episode)Well as you may have noticed from that, Batman's not a great detective. \"Joker left this piece of cotton candy on the ground, maybe he's at the old amusement park\"! Yeah maybe, he was there the last 6 times.And I've already mentioned this but, EVERYONE KNOWS KUNG-FU! EVEN PENGUIN! what where they thinking?

If batman needs think, he'll use technology, then do some kung-fu.But hey, let's not forget the villains. Afterall, what would batman be without his rogues gallery?Well first off, I gotta say, kudos for originality. I don't think other batman media would have envisioned joker and a dread-locked monkey man, riddler like an emo, and poison ivy as a minor (which is kind of confusing when you think about, isn't her sexuality meant to be her main strength?)What's even more crap however is that, every character is now a 2-Dimensional, stereotypical crook.E.G.Killer Croc wants to flood Gotham for no reason.Man-Bat is a power hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for some unexplained reason.Penguin just wants to steal everything. For no reason.noticing a pattern here?But the most insulting has got to be Mr Freeze.Do you remember the Emmy award winning'Heart of Ice' episode from Batman: The Animated Series?

The one that made him a victim, with a goal? Hell, even Batman & Robin acknowledged that, using that as Mr Freezes origin in that P.O.S. movie.Well this series says \"F#ck that\" and makes Mr Freeze a jewelry robber before his accident, with only wealth in his mind, then gets frozen and gives him the power to make things cold. He then continues to steal jewels for no reason, while saying sh!t lines like \"Have an ice day\".Maybe they did watch Batman &Robin after all.But hey, look on the bright side.

{"original_text": "...it's a bit too formulaic and predictable. The jokes are funny, but they're not particularly original or surprising. The plot is your standard \"fish out of water\" story, with a group of bumbling soldiers trying to navigate a war zone. The characters are likable, but they're not particularly well-developed. The film's attempts at satire and social commentary feel a bit heavy-handed and obvious. I think the main problem is that the film relies too heavily on cheap gags and slapstick humor, rather than trying to create a more nuanced and thoughtful comedy. The film's tone is all over the place, veering wildly from silly to serious and back again. It's like the filmmakers couldn't quite decide what kind of movie they wanted to make. That being said, there are a few bright spots. The film's visuals are impressive, with some great location shooting and clever use of special effects. The cast is also generally strong, with some great performances from the leads. And the film's climax is actually pretty effective, with a great payoff to the story. Overall, I'd say that \"Don't Look Now... We're Being Shot At!\" is a solid, if unspectacular, comedy.

There's a pretty risqu\u00e9 amount of female nudity on display, for those who like that kind of thing (but obviously nothing hardcore).Most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential; the girls are stereotypes, and German Anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder - she's a moron obsessed with colour TV who acts like a kind of uninhibited child & dresses to deliberately show her private parts; in another more serious film, she would be a psychiatric case. The most interesting section of the film involves the Swedish girl being taken to a club in London where some dodgy types are still trying to swing, being seduced by a middle-aged rocker, losing her virginity and realising that the scene is not for her.

Obviously not, as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that Beowulf and his crew (save for mullet boy) are wearing.

{"original_text": "...Stephen King's involvement in the project is the only thing that's really \"maximum\" about it. I mean, the idea of a comet passing by the Earth and causing all sorts of mechanical objects to come to life and wreak havoc is a great concept, but the execution is just so... meh. The characters are paper-thin, the dialogue is cheesy, and the plot is predictable and lacks any real tension or suspense. And don't even get me started on the acting. Emilio Estevez is just phoning it in as Bill, the protagonist, and Pat Hingle is wasted in a thankless role as the gruff but lovable diner owner. The rest of the cast is forgettable, and the only one who really stands out is the truck that runs over all those people. At least it's consistent in its brutality. I think what really disappoints me is that \"Maximum Overdrive\" had the potential to be so much more. With a better script and some more thoughtful direction, this could have been a cult classic. Instead, it's just a forgettable, made-for-TV-style horror movie that's only notable for its association with Stephen King. Still, I have to admit that I did find some moments entertaining. The scene where the truck full of beer cans runs over all those people is pretty great, and the final showdown between Bill and the possessed 18-wheeler is at least somewhat intense. But overall, \"Maximum Overdrive\" is a disappointment, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except maybe die-hard Stephen King fans who are looking for something to laugh at.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "\"Maximum brutality\" is one of those movies that you just don't know what to expect from it.

The decor is a nod to the blues and rock 'n' roll pioneers who have performed here over the years, and the energy is palpable. The food was top-notch, with a menu that features classic American comfort food with a Southern twist. I opted for the gumbo and it was absolutely delicious, with a perfect balance of spices and flavors. The service was friendly and attentive, with our server knowledgeable about the menu and happy to make recommendations. But the real draw here is the music. The Howlin' Wolf has hosted some of the biggest names in music, and it's easy to see why. The sound system is state-of-the-art, and the acoustics are perfect for a live show. We caught a local blues band, and they were incredible. The crowd was dancing and singing along, and the energy was electric.

{"original_text": "**A Blazing Masterpiece that Will Leave You Breathless** \"The Burning\" is a horror classic that has stood the test of time, and for good reason. This 1981 gem is a masterclass in suspense, terror, and gore, expertly crafted by writer-director Tony Maylam. The film tells the story of a summer camp counselor who is horribly disfigured in a prank gone wrong, only to seek revenge on his former friends and colleagues. What sets \"The Burning\" apart from other horror films of its era is its relentless pace, which never lets up from start to finish. The tension builds slowly but surely, culminating in a series of gruesome and unforgettable set pieces that will leave even the most hardened horror fans squirming in their seats. The special effects, which were groundbreaking at the time, still hold up today, making the film's most graphic moments all the more unsettling. But what truly makes \"The Burning\" a standout is its ability to balance style and substance.

{"original_text": "...a sense of disappointment washes over me. I had high hopes for this film, especially after reading all the critical acclaim it received. But, unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. The story, which is based on Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, has some interesting themes and characters, but the execution feels a bit flat to me. I think what's missing is a sense of urgency or momentum. The pacing is slow and plodding, and the plot twists and turns feel a bit predictable. The characters, while well-acted, don't feel fully fleshed out. I didn't really connect with Willie Stark, the protagonist, despite Sean Penn's strong performance. And the supporting cast, while talented, feels a bit one-dimensional. I also think the film's tone is a bit off. It's trying to be a serious drama, but it feels like it's missing a sense of gravity or emotional depth. The themes of politics, power, and corruption are all relevant and timely, but the film doesn't really explore them in a way that feels particularly nuanced or thought-provoking. Overall, I'd say \"All the King's Men\" is a solid, if unremarkable, film. It's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours, but it's not a must-see either.

If you know your Indian dishes you won't be disappointed. Kids are always welcome there. Be sure to enjoy downtown while you're there."}
{"original_text": "**A Rootin' Tootin' Good Time** \"Urban Cowboy\" is a foot-stompin', hand-clappin' good time from start to finish. John Travolta shines as Bud Davis, a young Texan who falls for a rodeo queen (Debra Winger) at a Houston honky-tonk. The film's blend of country music, romance, and rodeo action makes for an irresistible combination. The soundtrack, featuring Willie Nelson and other country legends, is a highlight. The film's energy is infectious, and the characters are well-developed and relatable.

{"original_text": "Lee Chang-dong's exceptional \"Secret Sunshine\" is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year. It is an instantly sobering, brutally honest character piece on the reverberations of loss and a graceful memento mori that resonates with a striking density of thought, yet remains as inscrutable as the emotions it observes. Through its layered naturalism and stunningly trenchant view of small-town dynamics, Lee implicitly deconstructs the traditional Korean melodrama by pulling apart the cinematics of excess and ripping to shreds the arcs that shape its characters and grounds the proceedings into a crushing grind of stoic realism.\"Secret Sunshine\" remains an immensely compelling, fluid work throughout its 142-minute runtime. Its bravura first hour is filled to the brim with subtextual insinuations, remarkable foreshadowing and adroit reversals of tone brought about by humanistic capriciousness. Adapted from a short story, Lee infuses the film with his sensitivity for the sublime paradoxes of life, last seen in his transgressively comic and irreverent \"Oasis\". Understanding how personal revolutions are forged when views of our universe are changed, Lee not only sees the emotional cataclysm of a widow's sorrow through an inquiring scope but also feels the tumultuous existential currents that underpin the film when religion becomes a narrative scapegoat in comprehending the heinousness of the human experience.Do-yeon Jeon's (\"You Are My Sunshine\") Best Actress accolade at Cannes in 2007 is well deserved. Her performance as the widow Shin-ae remains an unrelenting enigma. As a character pulled apart by forces beyond her control, the sheer magnificence of this performance is central to the film's turbulent nature. With Jeon essaying one cyclonic upheaval after another, there's a tremulous sense of collapse that the film, to its credit, never approaches. Instead it finds a delicate balance that saps the charged theatricality and subsequent banality from ordinary tragedies and its fallouts. She becomes the centre of the film's universe as well as ours. Filmed in glorious hand-held CinemaScope, the film demolishes the cinematicism of frames and compositions by becoming visually acute just as it is quietly harrowing when the camera never relinquishes its gaze from Shin-ae through times of happiness, guilt and remorse.Lee captures the details of life in the small, suspicious town of Miryang \u0096 the awkwardness of communal situations, its uncomfortable silences and its devastations spun out of personal dramas. Shin-ae's interactions with the townsfolk rarely inspires dividends, especially when they are merely done out of obligation to fit in for the sake of her son, Jun (Seon Jung-yeop). The one recurring acquaintance is Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho), a bachelor mechanic of uncertain intentions who helps her en route to Miryang in the film's enchanting open sequence set to a captivating stream of sunlight. Song has situated himself as a comedic anti-hero in South Korea's biggest films but his nuanced, low-key delivery here purports the director's thought process of never having to reveal more than plainly necessary.If pain is ephemeral, then grief can never truly dissipate. And Lee finds complexity in subsistence. When Shin-ae attempts to head down the path of reconciliation only to be faced again with unimaginable heartbreak, she unsuccessfully employs the fellowship of evangelical Christianity as a foil to her sorrow. But Lee knows better than that when he understands that religion, in the context of the human canvas of strife and misery, is never a simple solution. But Lee never rebukes the essence of religion as he realises the value of salvation for some through a higher power even if it serves a form of denial in others. The scenes in its latter half which deal with religion doesn't allow itself to become aggressively scornful, which is a feat in itself considering how many filmmakers let the momentum of the material take over from what they need to say to be true to its story and characters.Lee's first film since his call to office as his country's Minister of Culture and Tourism is an uncompromising dissertation on human suffering. In a film so artless and genuine, it arduously reveals that there's nothing as simple as emotional catharsis, just the suppression and abatement of agony. \"Secret Sunshine\" leaves us with tender mercies pulled out of evanescence, and points towards a profound understanding of despair and faith.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Lee Chang-dong's exceptional \"Secret Sunshine\" is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year.

With Jeon essaying one cyclonic upheaval after another, there's a tremulous sense of collapse that the film, to its credit, never approaches. Instead it finds a delicate balance that saps the charged theatricality and subsequent banality from ordinary tragedies and its fallouts. She becomes the centre of the film's universe as well as ours. Filmed in glorious hand-held CinemaScope, the film demolishes the cinematicism of frames and compositions by becoming visually acute just as it is quietly harrowing when the camera never relinquishes its gaze from Shin-ae through times of happiness, guilt and remorse.Lee captures the details of life in the small, suspicious town of Miryang \u0096 the awkwardness of communal situations, its uncomfortable silences and its devastations spun out of personal dramas. Shin-ae's interactions with the townsfolk rarely inspires dividends, especially when they are merely done out of obligation to fit in for the sake of her son, Jun (Seon Jung-yeop). The one recurring acquaintance is Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho), a bachelor mechanic of uncertain intentions who helps her en route to Miryang in the film's enchanting open sequence set to a captivating stream of sunlight. Song has situated himself as a comedic anti-hero in South Korea's biggest films but his nuanced, low-key delivery here purports the director's thought process of never having to reveal more than plainly necessary.If pain is ephemeral, then grief can never truly dissipate. And Lee finds complexity in subsistence. When Shin-ae attempts to head down the path of reconciliation only to be faced again with unimaginable heartbreak, she unsuccessfully employs the fellowship of evangelical Christianity as a foil to her sorrow. But Lee knows better than that when he understands that religion, in the context of the human canvas of strife and misery, is never a simple solution. But Lee never rebukes the essence of religion as he realises the value of salvation for some through a higher power even if it serves a form of denial in others. The scenes in its latter half which deal with religion doesn't allow itself to become aggressively scornful, which is a feat in itself considering how many filmmakers let the momentum of the material take over from what they need to say to be true to its story and characters.Lee's first film since his call to office as his country's Minister of Culture and Tourism is an uncompromising dissertation on human suffering. In a film so artless and genuine, it arduously reveals that there's nothing as simple as emotional catharsis, just the suppression and abatement of agony. \"Secret Sunshine\" leaves us with tender mercies pulled out of evanescence, and points towards a profound understanding of despair and faith."}
{"original_text": "**A Groundbreaking Masterpiece that Shatters the Mold** D.W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" is a cinematic behemoth that defies convention and pushes the boundaries of storytelling. This 1916 epic is a sprawling, four-hour odyssey that weaves together four seemingly unrelated tales, each exploring the destructive power of intolerance in a different era. From ancient Babylon to the American South, Griffith masterfully juxtaposes these disparate narratives, creating a work of breathtaking scope and emotional resonance. Visually, \"Intolerance\" is a marvel, featuring some of the most innovative and daring cinematography of its time. Griffith's use of intertitles, cross-cutting, and innovative camera angles creates a sense of dynamic energy that propels the viewer through the film's sprawling narrative. The performances, too, are remarkable, with each actress bringing a depth and nuance to her character that's still impressive today. But what truly sets \"Intolerance\" apart is its unwavering commitment to its themes. Griffith's scathing critique of intolerance is both timely and timeless, speaking to the very heart of human nature. This is a film that will leave you breathless, moved, and perhaps even changed. If you're prepared to immerse yourself in a cinematic experience like no other, then \"Intolerance\" awaits \u2013 a true masterpiece of the silent era.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "\"Intolerance\" is a silent masterpiece that will leave you breathless, moved, and perhaps even changed... if you're prepared to immerse yourself in a cinematic experience like no other, then \" Intolerance\" awaits... a true masterpiece of the silent era..if you've never seen it, then you'd better hurry... it's on your list of must-sees... this is a film you'll want to see again and again... a masterpiece of cinema that Shatters the Mold...

{"original_text": "Well! What can one say? Firstly, this adaptation is far too long at 4 hours, for the complexity (or lack of such) of the plot. The actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available. Swayzee is really NOT a Quatermain character at all. After seeing Sean Connery's interpretation of the great man in \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\", Swayzee really does not make the grade. This chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength, stature, subtlety, or humour needed for the part, and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor, who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast. Some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography. For example. When the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert, their tracks are visible down to the oasis, just waiting for them to walk in them. Climbing out of the mine leads to an exit (on the next shot) nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through, et cetera. I was waiting for Doug McClure to appear at any moment. In some ways I wish he had. The leader of the Russians pursuing Quatermain is a shoddily created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything. Swayzee does quite well as the sad father, returned to London, who is unable to obtain the custody of his son. Swayzee should stick to that sort of thing.

I made an appointment and was lucky enough to get one for the same day, later that afternoon with Ashley. There were two women at the front desk who greeted me as I arrived. Both ladies were very pleasant and one escorted me up to the second floor waiting room. She spoke about the other services they provide. The waiting room is dimly lit and their is soft music playing throughout. I think they accidentally double booked Ashley, as I waited 15-20 minutes, which wasn't that big a deal (in my opinion). Ashley met me and brought me into the treatment room, where she also had music playing. She asked me what I was looking for and walked me through the process. She got to work right away and even asked if the temperature of the wax was OK. She also filled my brows in with a pencil before letting me see the finished look. I am very happy with my brows. She listened when I said I didn't want them too thin and she didn't try to change my look. I will definitely be returning in 5 weeks and will recommend to friends in the area."}

While both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop, \"Stardust\" is so much different than any other fantasy/sci-fi film I've ever seen. It's such a hybrid of those genres, but its plot and script are so unique that--along with the performances, special effects, cinematography, and score--the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen. Secondly, the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along, while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist. Thirdly, I did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way. In fact, the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch. Wonderfully casted, and superbly acted across the board. This fantasy adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best one I've seen since \"Return of the King\" (not that I am comparing the two at all). OK, so its not that easy to sum up, but don't let any crude and/or heartless and cynical review nor the film's pathetic PR prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer (or even possibly in a long time)!", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This remarkable film can be summed up very easily.

But did it have to be so obvious? I felt like I was being hit over the head with the message the whole time. And don't even get me started on the characters. The pigs were just so... one-dimensional.

{"original_text": "...it is a film that deals with some very mature and difficult themes, including poverty, exploitation, and the darker aspects of human nature. The movie follows a con artist and his young daughter as they travel through the Great Depression, and it's clear that the film's director, Peter Bogdanovich, was trying to tackle some heavy subject matter. The problem is that the film's tone is all over the place, veering wildly from slapstick comedy to dark drama and back again. This makes it hard to fully invest in the characters or their story, and it can be uncomfortable to watch at times. The performances are also somewhat uneven, with Ryan O'Neal and Tatum O'Neal (who was only 8 years old at the time of filming) struggling to find a consistent tone. Additionally, the film's portrayal of poverty and exploitation can be quite graphic and disturbing, which may not be to everyone's taste. While I appreciate the film's ambition and the performances of its leads, I just couldn't shake the feeling that it was a bit too much for me to handle. Overall, I'd say that \"Paper Moon\" is a film that's definitely worth seeing for its historical significance and the performances of its leads, but it's not necessarily an easy watch.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "\"Paper Moon\" is a film that's definitely worth seeing for its historical significance and the performances of its leads, but it's not necessarily an easy watch.

In much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there, the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man, and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return.

{"original_text": "**A Sinister and Unsettling Masterpiece: \"Prince of Darkness\" Review** John Carpenter's \"Prince of Darkness\" is a thought-provoking and deeply unsettling horror film that explores the darker aspects of human nature and the supernatural. This 1987 cult classic tells the story of a group of scientists and priests who discover a mysterious can of holy water in an abandoned church, only to unleash a malevolent force that threatens to destroy the world. The film's atmosphere is tense and foreboding, with Carpenter's signature use of long takes and eerie sound design creating a sense of unease from the very beginning. The cast, including Donald Pleasence and Victor Wong, deliver solid performances, but it's the film's themes and ideas that truly make it stand out.

{"original_text": "To bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as Braveheart. Though it is a very different kind of film, the conflict between Scottish commoners and English nobility is front and center here as well. Roughly 400 years had passed between the time Braveheart took place and Rob Roy was set, but some things never seemed to change. Scottland is still run by English nobles, and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them. Rob Roy is handsomely done, but not the grand epic that Braveheart was. There are no large-scale battles, and the conflict here is more between individuals. And helpfully so not all Englishmen are portrayed as evil this time. Rob Roy is simply a film about those with honor, and those who are truly evil.Liam Neeson plays the title character Rob Roy MacGregor. He is the leader of the MacGregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the Marquis of Montrose (John Hurt). Things look pretty rough for the MacGregor clan as winter is approaching, and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone. Rob Roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the Marquis and purchase some cattle of his own. He would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community. Sounds fair enough, doesn't it? Problems arise when two cronies of the Marquis steal the money for themselves. One of them, known as Archibald Cunningham, is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film. Played wonderfully by Tim Roth, this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the Marquis by his mother. This man is disgustingly effeminate, rude, heartless, and very dangerous with a sword. He fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility. He rapes Macgregor's wife and burns him out of his home. This guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come. Along with another crony of the Marquis (Brian Cox) Cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts. Though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened, the Marquis still holds MacGregor to the debt. This sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity.Spoilers ahead!!!!!Luckily for the MacGregor's, a Duke who is no friend to the Marquis sets up a final duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all. This sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed. Cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace. And for most of the fight, it looks like these attributes will win out. Just when it looks like Rob Roy is finished, he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner. The first time you see what happens, you will probably be as shocked as Cunningham! Rob Roy is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and perfectly paced. The score is quite memorable, too. The casting choices seem to have worked out as Jessica Lange, who might seem to be out of her element, actually turns in one of the strongest performances as Mary MacGregor. The film is violent, but there isn't too much gore. It is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior, however. The nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy. The film has no obvious flaws, thus it gets 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "To bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as Braveheart.

{"original_text": "...a sense of disappointment washes over me. I had heard so many great things about this 1980 sci-fi classic, but unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. The special effects, which were supposed to be groundbreaking at the time, now seem cheesy and dated. The acting is also subpar, with Sam Jones's performance as Flash Gordon coming across as wooden and unconvincing. I'm also feeling a bit frustrated with the storyline, which is overly simplistic and predictable. The evil Emperor Ming's plan to destroy Earth is laughable, and the heroes' constant bickering and infighting gets old quickly. And don't even get me started on the character of Princess Aura - she's supposed to be a strong and independent leader, but comes across as more like a caricature of a femme fatale.

{"original_text": "Since starting to read the book this movie is based on, I'm having mixed feelings about the filmed result. I learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before I read the book, because I found that if I read the book first I was inevitably disappointed in the film. This would undoubtedly have been true here, whereas in the case of Atonement, which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book I've ever seen, it would probably not have mattered.I'm trying to figure out what the cause is, and I suspect that I have to point my finger squarely at Michael Cunningham. Much as I respect him for The Hours (which I have not read but which I saw and was awed by) I cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted Susan Minton's book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it.It's not that I dislike the movie. I actually love the movie, which is why, since I started reading the novel, I'm feeling disturbed about the whole thing. I feel disloyal to Ms. Minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work. Reading it, I can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it. Unlike what one reviewer of the movie said, it's not so much that some novels don't deserve to be a movie; it's more like some books just can't make the transition. Ms. Minton's novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character, so internally, that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm. Even though a lot of the book is memory of real events, it is memory, and so fragmented and ethereal as to be, I feel, not filmable. I think that Ms. Minton's work is a real work of literature, but cannot make the transition to film, which in no way detracts from its value.I cannot yet report that Evening, the film, does not represent Evening, the novel, in any more than the most superficial way, since I'm only halfway through, but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point. I guess I'm writing this because I feel that if you're going to adapt a novel, adapt it, but don't make it something else that it's not. I'm not sure if Michael Cunningham has done anything wholly original, but from what I can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else's work. We would not have The Hours if Virginia Woolf had not written Mrs. Dalloway, and we would not have Evening, in its distressed form, if Susan Minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place. But it's too much to say that it would be better if Ms. Minton had left well enough alone, because Evening, the film, is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own.Thus my confusion, mixed feelings, sense of disloyalty, and ultimate conclusion that, in this case, the novel cannot be the film and vice versa, and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did, so that we have both works as they are.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Since starting to read the book this movie is based on, I'm having mixed feelings about the filmed result.

I guess I'm writing this because I feel that if you're going to adapt a novel, adapt it, but don't make it something else that it's not. I'm not sure if Michael Cunningham has done anything wholly original, but from what I can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else's work. We would not have The Hours if Virginia Woolf had not written Mrs. Dalloway, and we would not have Evening, in its distressed form, if Susan Minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place. But it's too much to say that it would be better if Ms. Minton had left well enough alone, because Evening, the film, is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own.Thus my confusion, mixed feelings, sense of disloyalty, and ultimate conclusion that, in this case, the novel cannot be the film and vice versa, and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did, so that we have both works as they are."}

He brings us the young lovers of MPK with a pinch of the HAHK wedding, and we have a winner. The story outline is similar to HAHK, light hearted in the beginning to serious mode at the end. The director also made character that you could relate to. The thing I did not like about HAHK was that the characters were too eccentric. The casting adds to its perfection. Shahid Kapoor surprised me with a good performance. This is a major improvement, and most importantly he suits the role. The best is easily Amrita Rao. In fact, this is her best performance. Her screen presence is so electrifying, you are bound to love her performance. Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, Anupam Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are terrifically cast. Not one actor feels out of place. The songs were quite disappointing but they will sound better after watching them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are nice ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is also nice in watching. The songs aren't colorful and dancey, and they are more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein which is bound to remind you of HSSH and HAHK. So what was the flaw in the movie? The movie gets quite slow, and the ending is quite stretched.

Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost. We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese. These were denser than typical Paneer. The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good. Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal. I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh. Regardless, it was tasty.

{"original_text": "PROM NIGHT (2008)directed by: Nelson McCormickstarring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davisplot: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (Jonathan Schaech) who has a bit of a crush on her. Now, she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends. Once there, they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn Donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt. pros: I got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves.An example:Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her (she doesn't seem that great) has escaped from prison. Their reason: They don't want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. LOLcons: Let me start off by saying I'm a huge slasher fan. Usually I can have fun with even the bad ones. I even like some PG-13 horror films. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also enjoy POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated PG-13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie.First of all, I had a big problem with the story. I like slasher films that don't even have stories. At least they can be entertaining. This is about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills her entire family. A few years later, he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends...? Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone cared about. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and I couldn't care less. This should have been a Lifetime feature, not a remake of PROM NIGHT. And then.... this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes. I don't even care that it's not that gory, some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) were not that gory but they still had effective murders. Here, we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen, a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds, and a closeup on a bad actor's face as he screams in agony. I'm sure that 10 year-old girls were terrified, but not me.I also hated the characters. There was Donna's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life, unless you are a gay male. Then we had Donna's annoying friends Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the token mean girl Chrissy (Brianne Davis). If you thought the characters in DEATH PROOF were annoying, try watching this movie. And don't get me started on Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and the DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me flashbacks to Usher's performance in SHE'S ALL THAT.Add to all that predictable plot turns, a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material, and you have quite a stinker.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "PROM NIGHT (2008)directed by: Nelson McCormickstarring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davisplot: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (Jonathan Schaech) who has a bit of a crush on her.

But when my friends suggested to meet them here for brunch this past weekend, I trusted their better judgement. In the end, I'm glad I did. This cozy Center City spot not only serves an amazing (and dare I say, a contender for the best) brunch in Philly, the staff really make you feel at home. They really know how to wow their patrons: fresh food, delightful presentation, and so many delicious sounding choices it's hard to choose which dish you want from their one page menu for mains.

The plate comes out with two sunny-side up eggs, fried in olive oil and garnished with fresh parsely. It's served alongside a grilled slice of lounza (Greek ham), two pieces of salty, crisp fried halloumi, warm bread, and tomato, cucumber, and onion salad. The menu also features a spread of other traditional Greek, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern specialities: Avgolemono, Moussaka, Pastitsio, Shaksouka, and Malohwa to name a few.

The service may be a little over-attentive in an attempt to make you feel more than welcome, but it's much appreciated, especially when other restaurants fail to put as much effort into the service as they do the food. One other tip: reservations are highly recommended, if not required. Because of Kanella's small space, getting a table at brunch is nearly impossible if you're not on the list.

But, overall it was solid Trek material and a good romp.I'll get the nits out of the way first.

The characters, though still new, seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect. The Vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before, with a slightly ominous theme. I particularly liked the linguist, who is the first Star Trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death, but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears. They seemed to stay true to Trek lore, something that has been a significant problem in past series, though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields, the instant invention of technology that can fix anything, and the inevitable plethora of time-travel stories.

This story picks up a few years from the end of the first, Jim (Tom Burlinson) has been away gathering his fortune in a brood of stock horses. He returns to pick up where he left off with his pluckish well-bred sweetheart Jessica (played by Aussie divine lady Sigrid Thornton) who is still attempting to break out of her corseted upbringing on her feather's cattle station (Harrison is now played by American Brian Dennehy). The foil to Jim and character that shakes the plot is the well-to-do upper class snob Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie) who has his sights on Jessica. Add to the mix some social tension surrounding landholdings and the stallion with a bad attitude from the first film and that's the plot.The best thing about this film is the acting. Tom Burlinson fits snugly into Jim's wide brim hat and laconic humour. Sigrid Thornton is a lovely heroine and the two manage some real chemistry on screen. Filling the solid shoes of Kirk Douglas was never going to be easy and Brian Dennehy stomps and shouts but never feels very authentic in this part.The music is sweeping and lush and the cinematography could be a roll from a Victoria tourism reel. There are moment however that feel very self-indulgent, like the director wants just one more helicopter shot of the riders to show how gorgeous the landscape is without some personal human drama. A little more grit would have sufficed here, we are Aussie's, we can take it!! There are some very JAWSish moments with the stallion that defy belief. However the funny thing about this film is that in amongst some glaring clich\u00e9s, there are some really inventive and touching scenes. Jim putting the saddle on the stallion (VERY Horse Whisperish before its time) Jim and Jessica setting up home, the fabulous scene where Jim shows up Alistair's riding with his trusty whip. I can see why this character is such an icon.Altogether a very pleasing sequel. Here's hoping everyone involved wants to make another. the Man From Snowy River III: The CRAIGS.

{"original_text": "**5/5 Stars** I'm obsessed with Cafe Victoria's! I've been going there for breakfast every Sunday with my girlfriends, and we always leave feeling like queens. The atmosphere is cozy and intimate, with a vintage vibe that makes you feel like you're in a Parisian cafe. The staff is always friendly and attentive, and the owner, Victoria, is always making the rounds to make sure everything is to your liking. But the real star of the show is the food. Oh. My. God. The eggs benedict is to die for, and the avocado toast is creamy and crunchy perfection. And don't even get me started on the coffee - it's strong and rich, just the way I like it. We always order a few pastries to share, and the croissants are flaky and buttery heaven. I've tried a few other spots in the area, but Cafe Victoria's is hands-down my favorite. The prices are reasonable, and the quality is top-notch. If you're looking for a delicious breakfast or brunch spot, look no further than Cafe Victoria's. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "If you're looking for a delicious breakfast or brunch spot, look no further than Cafe Victoria's, which has been voted one of the best places to eat in New York City for the past four years in a row by the New York Post's food critic, Daniel Fienberg.

I'm feeling a deep sense of connection to the hobbits, elves, dwarves, and humans as they embark on their perilous journey to destroy the One Ring. As I reflect on the film, I'm struck by the themes of friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice that run throughout the story. The bonds between Frodo and Sam, Aragorn and Legolas, and Gandalf and the Fellowship are truly heartwarming, and I'm inspired by the courage and determination of the characters as they face overwhelming odds. The film's visuals are breathtaking, from the lush green hills of the Shire to the treacherous mountains of Moria and the dark lands of Mordor. The special effects are seamless, and the action scenes are thrilling and intense. I'm particularly impressed by the way the film's score, composed by Howard Shore, perfectly complements the on-screen action, adding depth and emotion to the story. As the credits roll, I'm left feeling satisfied but also a little melancholy, knowing that the journey of the Fellowship has come to an end.

{"original_text": "...the film's attempts to tackle complex themes of colonialism, racism, and cultural misunderstandings fell flat for me. The pacing was slow and plodding, and the characters felt more like archetypes than fully fleshed-out people. The cinematography was lovely, I'll give it that - the Indian landscapes and architecture were stunning. But overall, I just didn't find the story or characters engaging enough to keep me invested. I think part of the problem was that the film relied too heavily on the \"fish out of water\" trope, with the British characters struggling to navigate Indian culture and the Indian characters struggling to navigate British culture. It felt like a simplistic and heavy-handed way to explore the complexities of colonialism. And don't even get me started on the character of Adela - I just couldn't stand her. She was so whiny and entitled, and her reaction to the \"assault\" was just ridiculous. I know that \"A Passage to India\" is a classic and has been praised for its nuanced portrayal of colonialism, but for me, it just didn't live up to the hype. Maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to appreciate its subtleties, but I left the film feeling underwhelmed and unimpressed.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "\"A Passage to India\" is one of my all-time favourite films, but it just didn't live up to the hype for me this time around, despite the fact that it's one of the most anticipated films of the year....I'm sorry, but I don't think I've ever seen a film like this before where I felt like the characters were so clich\u00e9d that I couldn't care less if they were British, Indian, or even American - it just wasn't good enough for me to enjoy it any more than I already do.."}

{"original_text": "In a nutshell: These guys are awesome to deal with. They came on time; They worked their butts off until the job was done; They were very tidy and considerate of my property; and I got exactly what was promised at a fair price. The Details: When my A/C went on a hot summer day I thought ugh, I wish I knew someone in the field. I didn't, so I started reading reviews and calling around. The main HVAC repair companies around town came across as contractors (middlemen) that would just end up costing me more money in the end. I knew what I wanted. I wanted to deal directly with the guy who was going to do the work. Someone who cared about customer satisfaction. Someone I could trust. I found all those things and more when I spoke to Ray, the owner and operator of Trust Home Comfort. When I read some of the reviews on the competition, it seemed that the biggest frustration out there were people who were charged a couple hundred of dollars to get a guy out, only to be told that their old A/C was not worth repairing. I didn't want that to happen to me, so I took the unorthodox approach of taking a brief video of my problem and posting it to YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iMHhimCqUo. This will be great, I thought. Saves everyone time, and hopefully me some money. Right? Wishful thinking, none of the big companies were even willing to look at the video. So I kept calling around. Eventually, I got a hold of Van (the office guy) at Trust Home Comfort. He was great! He said \"Sure, we'll have a look at the video\", so I emailed him the link with some photos of my system. I heard back a short time later from the owner of the company, Ray, who is a journeyman HVAC technician with a 4 year degree in Refrigeration Technology. Ray told me straight up that he didn't think the problem was what I was hoping it would be (a low cost contactor part), but in order to know for sure he would have to come out and run a diagnostic. They both reassured me that if I had to replace the entire system, I wouldn't be charged for the service call AND a new system. When Ray (the owner/technician) arrived the next day he took his electronic meter measurements, and was able to confirm that my compressor was shot. I would need a new system. We sat down to discussed my options. Ray was very honest and forthright about which system would be best for me. He took his time and shared his experience about what other customers have liked. No high pressure sales. No lies about pricing. Just the straight honest goods you would expect from a technician. I loved that. We ended up upgrading our HVAC system to one of the new units that is VERY quite and comes with a 10 year parts warranty. I think my neighbor was especially pleased with the \"quite\" part. Ray was even willing to do the job on a long weekend, even though he planned on taking it off.

{"original_text": "My Comments for VIVAH:- Its a charming, idealistic love story starring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom's families sleeping on the floor, playing games together, their friendly banter and mutual respect. Vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals. Yes, the central romance is naively visualized. But the sneaked-in romantic moments between the to-be-married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism. The film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom, on the wedding night, tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries: \"Come let me do your dressing\"V I V A H - showcases a lot of good things - beauty of arranged marriage, beauty of Indian culture, beauty of Indian woman, last but not least a nice IDEALISM of the about-to-be-couple waiting to get married..... playing by the rules! Simple yet Beautiful; Such a Simple story..... no plot.... no villain - as is the case with most of Sooraj Barjatya films. Sooraj sir is back to what he does BEST. He has made the movie with FULL CONVICTION. Its a very sweet film - which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout Arranged Marriage & the Union of 2 Families. I think AMRITA RAO - looks very good & she has acted very well. She has most of the good scenes - although I thought the last half hour was completely to Shahid Kapur - who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance. I also liked the acting of all others for ex. the Choti i.e. Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, Shahid's bro & sis-in-law. It almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could. Sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain. The chemistry between Shahid & Amrita is AWESOME.Stuff like Sanctity in a Marriage/Relationship, Avoiding Courtship, Mutual Respect, Care & Space, Waiting for getting Married \"officially\", Praying/Sacrficing for Ur Beloved - all these and more get SHOWCASED in Vivah. There's still some good audience who r going & enjoying this film. Some of the folks/audience are already excited after seeing, that they r thinking bout Arranged-Marriage:) Thats Success if you ask me. it seems AMRITA RAO - our actress-from-Vivah {Result for a nice performance} has been bestowed the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE award for 2006!! Hats off to her for this achievement Chalo, even though Vivah, Shahid or Amrita didn't get any of the film-fare & other awards; @ least this is news to CHEER about!! Congrats to AMRITA RAO- for showing us a visual of Indian Bride-to-be in the purest form and Of Course to Sooraj Barjatya for portraying her the best way:) Shudn't forget Shahid Kapur and all others who make VIVAH as sweet and legendary as it is today!! Imagine, to share the same pedestal as the legendary Dilip Kumar........... Its no mean achievement!! Congrats to Amrita Rao - for taking her Career to another level with this award..... I personally feel - she should keep doing movies only with Shahid Kapur!! They make a cute couple and their on-screen chemistry reminds me of {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla}.................. Some points that I observed,few of the elements:- #1 If u notice carefully, Amrita Rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses. She gives every bit of the Indian Woman essence - in this film!! Perfect Fit #2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us - not exactly ready for marriage or early-marriage..... but PREM listens carefully to the step-wise talk given by his DAD - having full faith in Anupam Kher. Eventually \"Honesty\" & \"Trust\" are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with Amrita. Most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person. But according to what I saw in this film, I have a feeling - that Two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also, Its possible!!! #3 In the entire movie - there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where Shahid & Amrita are together - or shown to be together. Its unlike most other romantic/wedding-based movies where Hero & Heroine are always singing/dancing or nowadays - doing cheap stuff. But the beauty of each of these 5 sequences:- Characterized by restraint, innocence & respect for the other! #4 I really liked the relationship shown between Chacha ALOK NATH & Amrita Rao. These kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters/girl-kids in some parts of India. #5 Romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely - no cheap scenes,songs are beautifully pictured!! Words like \"Jal\",\"praarthana\" e.t.c. are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film:) Personally, I really am fond of many dialogs in this film. #6 Last but not the least - The entire Hospital Scene where Shahid puts \"sindhoor\" to Amrita when shes struggling for Life - is terrific. Those dialogs between the couple are so touching and U feel the LOVE/I-cant-do-without-U; Its a Hats-Off feeling!!! *** In many ways, VIVAH reminded me of Maine Pyar Kiya, DDLJ, Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - for the freshness/on-screen-chemistry of the LEAD pair:):) *** IF U ASK ME:- Along with films like Rang De Basanti, Lage Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE and Kabul Express, V I V A H ranks among the best films made in 2006.

{"original_text": "**A Timeless Tribute to the City That Never Sleeps** Martin Scorsese's \"New York, New York\" is a cinematic love letter to the city that never sleeps, and it's a masterpiece that will leave you breathless. This 1977 classic tells the story of two aspiring jazz musicians, Jimmy Doyle (Robert De Niro) and Francine Evans (Liza Minnelli), as they navigate the ups and downs of love, fame, and the music industry in the city that never stops. The film is a stunning visual feast, with Scorsese's trademark kinetic energy and vibrant cinematography capturing the gritty, pulsing heartbeat of 1970s New York. The performances are equally impressive, with De Niro and Minnelli delivering nuanced, emotionally charged portrayals of their characters. The chemistry between them is undeniable, and their on-screen romance is both tender and tumultuous. But what truly sets \"New York, New York\" apart is its soundtrack, featuring some of the most iconic jazz standards of the era. The film's score is a love letter to the music that defines the city, and it's a major reason why this movie remains so beloved to this day. Overall, \"New York, New York\" is a must-see for anyone who's ever fallen in love with the city that never sleeps.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "If you've ever fallen in love with the city that never sleeps, then you're in for a treat this weekend as \"New York, New York\" makes its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, where it will also be shown in select cities across the US on Friday and Saturday, as well as on home video on Sunday.

{"original_text": "I didn't think it could be done, but something has come along and replaced Open House- a low budget horror about someone killing over the high price of real estate- as the worst film I've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet life.It was touted as the best film in Montreal's most recent film festival, which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of blank-wall shots accompanied by people reading gloomy poetry.Watching this movie was like a little slice of Hell. It's from Austria, and it attempts to stumble along in the footsteps of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet- scenes about various characters living in a suburban area with a dark underbelly. There's the fat dog owner and his fat maid wife who stripteases for him, the skinny divorcee whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the untouched room of his dead child, the \u00fcber-annoying woman hitchhiker who recites top ten lists.... The list goes on. Forever. Much like the two hours plus I spent in that theatre.Yes, the characters interact, but not in a clever or interesting or even relevant way. I couldn't say if they were any good as actors, as, according to the subtitles, they were given lines that were the Austrian equivalent of \"You are so lame!\" They certainly didn't have to learn many, as each repeated his or her same lines at least three times in a scene.This is no Gummo, or any of the aforementioned movies. There is no art to discover, and nothing to dwell on afterwards except maybe whether or not you should change your \"never walk out during a movie\" policy (which quite a few older couples did during a random orgy scene- and if that sounds appetizing, it's not, unless you're one of few who doesn't find the idea of your parents having sex- and with a few local middle-aged couples, to boot- revolting).This movie was offensive to me. Not the flabby nudity, not the cringe-inducing soundtrack, not the shockless scenes involving guns. I was offended that someone actually spent money to make this when there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding. I was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see Dog Days and come out wondering if that was the best us Montrealers could find. Most of all, I was offended that, somehow, the people involved with the festival duped everyone into believing that the emperor had a gorgeous and mesmerising new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat maid wife doing a striptease.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I didn't think it could be done, but something has come along and replaced Open House- a low budget horror about someone killing over the high price of real estate- as the worst film I've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet life.It was touted as the best film in Montreal's most recent film festival, which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of blank-wall shots accompanied by people reading gloomy poetry.Watching this movie was like a little slice of Hell.

{"original_text": "If, like me, you like your films to be unique, and unlike the majority of other movies, then I wholly recommend that you check out The Beast. The film is a grotesque, erotic, fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological'Beast' that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a French mansion and lusts after women. The film is very daring with it's subject material, and that is something to give it credit for. The theme of bestiality is a definite taboo, and for good reason, I might add; but the film conveys it; straight and to the point. Like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre, The Beast could have gone around it, and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps, but Borowczyk didn't do that, and he is brave in that respect, especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms, but the fact that he went ahead with it, in my view, means a big thumbs up for the guy.The film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female. This opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience, in some ways, for the incredible, tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see. The scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking, and are bound to offend many people (hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years), but these scenes are not merely an excuse for Borowczyk to shock the viewer; this film has a defining point. As said during the film; the only difference between man and beast is intelligence. Both man and beast have instincts, only man knows how to control them. The Beast explores this difference between man and beast through sexuality; the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears epitomises the control of human desire, and it is only when the central female character lets go of her control that she can see the beast. The film has strong themes of the age-old story of'beauty and beast' weaved into it, and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust, but not without a moral.Many criticise the scenes around the film's shocking sex sequences for being boring, but these scenes are important to the film's story. Without these scenes, we wouldn't get to know the characters or the story of the beast, and, most importantly; the story of'beauty and the beast' would not be able to have it's horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience, and as that is one of the key elements of the film; it would be a real shame. Besides that, Borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes, not with shocks, but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family, along with the beautiful shots of the mansion's ground would not be seen, and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either.Overall, The Beast is a shocking film. It's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone. However, if you can get over the film's shock, and embrace The Beast; what awaits is a skilful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "If, like me, you like your films to be unique, and unlike the majority of other movies, then I wholly recommend that you check out The Beast.

Without these scenes, we wouldn't get to know the characters or the story of the beast, and, most importantly; the story of'beauty and the beast' would not be able to have it's horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience, and as that is one of the key elements of the film; it would be a real shame. Besides that, Borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes, not with shocks, but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family, along with the beautiful shots of the mansion's ground would not be seen, and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either.Overall, The Beast is a shocking film. It's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone. However, if you can get over the film's shock, and embrace The Beast; what awaits is a skilful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance."}

{"original_text": "I disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed \"masterpiece\" of the German New Wave: 1) There are major flaws in simple exposition, in the basic communication of critical plot points, as relating to Maria's abortion and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers understood that the husband agreed, in exchange for substantial financial remuneration, not to return to and reclaim his wife until Oswald was dead?2) The ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental. The original screenplay called for Maria to commit suicide after the reading of Oswald's will, on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide. Maria is then summarily blown up, rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self-delusion and moral compromise.3) Fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private, the political on the personal. Contrary to what the critics and \"experts\" assert, I don't think it works. Merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of German reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama. The selfish ambition of Maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so-called economic miracle of postwar Germany.

How many viewers understood that the husband agreed, in exchange for substantial financial remuneration, not to return to and reclaim his wife until Oswald was dead?2) The ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental. The original screenplay called for Maria to commit suicide after the reading of Oswald's will, on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide. Maria is then summarily blown up, rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self-delusion and moral compromise.3) Fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private, the political on the personal. Contrary to what the critics and \"experts\" assert, I don't think it works. Merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of German reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama. The selfish ambition of Maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so-called economic miracle of postwar Germany. Maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place, but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific. Women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self-advancement for ages. 4) Lastly, there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness -- Fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect.

{"original_text": "Dearest Reader, Please allow me to hereby confirm the rumors: Village Whiskey does, in fact, have the best burger in Philadelphia. And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. As my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to \"make me something awesome with whiskey in it.\" \"What kind of drink do you want?,\" he inquired. \"I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these.\" (Perhaps my banter wasn't quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the \"The Commodore\" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each. When our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can't wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious. Warning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table.

{"original_text": "...the film's unapologetic brutality, graphic violence, and dark humor create a sense of unease and tension that's hard to shake. The performances are also standout, particularly Warren Oates as the titular character, who brings a sense of quiet desperation and determination to the role. But what really sets \"Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia\" apart is its willingness to push boundaries and challenge its audience. The film's themes of revenge, obsession, and the blurring of morality are all presented in a way that's both visceral and thought-provoking. The cinematography is also noteworthy, capturing the gritty, rundown atmosphere of the film's Mexican locations with a sense of realism that's both haunting and beautiful. But what I think really makes \"Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia\" great is its sense of unpredictability. The film's pacing is slow-burning and deliberate, building towards a shocking and unsettling climax that will leave you feeling disturbed and uncomfortable. It's a film that's not afraid to take risks and challenge its audience, and that's what makes it so compelling.

{"original_text": "**A Delightfully Dark and Wickedly Witty Romp Through History** \"The Black Adder\" is a masterclass in dark humor, clever writing, and cleverer characters. This BBC series is a must-watch for anyone who loves a good laugh, a healthy dose of sarcasm, and a healthy disregard for historical accuracy. The show's protagonist, Edmund Blackadder, is a deliciously despicable cad who navigates the treacherous waters of British history with a wit as sharp as his tongue. The show's cast is pitch-perfect, with Rowan Atkinson's Blackadder stealing the show (as one would expect). His chemistry with his trusty sidekick, Baldrick (Tony Robinson), is undeniable, and their banter is some of the funniest I've ever had the pleasure of watching. The show's writing is clever and quick-witted, with a keen eye for satire and a willingness to tackle even the most sensitive topics with a healthy dose of irreverence. If you're looking for a show that will make you laugh, make you think, and make you question the very fabric of reality, then \"The Black Adder\" is the show for you.

{"original_text": "I am amazed at how this movie(and most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on IMDb. The fanboy mentality strikes again. When this movie came out just about everyone slammed it. Even my ex-girlfriend said this movie questionable. Years later I sat down to watch this movie and I found myself enjoying. Even laughing quite a bit. This and The Replacement Killers are the movies that had people labeling the director Antoine Fuqua as the black Michael Bay. I don't see how since most of Fuqua's movies are smarter than anything Michael Bay has came up with. At any rate...Story: Alvin Sanders(Jamie Foxx) is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense Treasury agent Edgar(David Morse) as a pawn to catch a killer named Bristol(Doug Hutchinson). Alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident. While these agents are after Bristol, Bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry.Jamie Foxx is funny as well as great as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on. Doug Hutchinson is okay as Bristol. He can be over-the-top sometimes in his John Malkovitchesque demeanor. He was better here than he was as Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother Stevie. Both him and Jamie had some funny moments on screen.The only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat. The scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but I couldn't look away. The director went all out there so he gets points for that. Plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty.All in all Bait is not a bad movie by a long shot. Its never boring, its always funny and I wasn't checking my watch every minute. That should count for something. Bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period.PS: to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent..... How long have you been living under a rock?

{"original_text": "Amy Heckerling's second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of 1930's gangster films made in the Warner Brothers' tradition. Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has continuing health problems, so Keaton falls into crime at an early age via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin, yeah that's right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother turned district attorney, Glynnis O'Connor his wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton's moll. The film looks notoriously cheap, making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film.The film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialog and gags, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery doing his best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious, not funny. Piscopo does the \"once\" bit one time too many. Several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a desk sergeant, and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers. The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film.

The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film. I think Heckerling should have known better, since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of The Roaring Twenties' actual 1939 release date. *1/2 of 4 stars."}

By favourite I don't mean something I like for now, I mean this film is so supernaturally perfect that there is never another animated experience going to touch it. This is obvious because I am never going to be a child again; I saw this film on ITV in the early nineties. I was 12 which is the age group this film is directed at, I'm also male, the gender that this film is intended for (the overwhelming majority of Miyazaki's protagonists are female). Consequently this film indelibly inspired my childhood psychology and I am forever indebted to Carl Macek (sp?) for producing the English dub of this film which is far superior to the Di$ney production which is not even funny - I've never even been able to watch that one - of course subtitled is the only way ultimately however the Macek version is SO good (the voices almost exactly corresponding to the original Japanese actors) that this version is available on the Japanese DVD! It's not available on any distribution in an English-speaking country. Go figure.There are hundreds of competent reviews so I'm going to put some trivia here, not that I'm the definitive archive of information for this film.First up I'd like to agree with the reviewer who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to review Miyazaki's films - they are so in their own league that they make almost the whole catalogue on IMDb combined pale into insignificance.The fascinating story with this film is that Miyazaki based the countryside around Slag's Ravine (Pazu's town area) on the Welsh mining communities. He visited Wales for a few months in the early 80s (might be late 70s) just after one of the great mining strikes. Being an avid supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight. The fight between the townsfolk and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man. The countryside and the clouds especially in this film remind me of where I grew up as his film depicts a fantasised version of the rolling hills of the midwest British Isles.The island is of course from Swift's genius satirical novel of the eighteenth century - the story in Swift's book is, deliberately, ridiculous. In Castle in The Sky, Miyazaki weaves together myths such as Atlantis and the Tower of Babel - I think the architecture in addition is based on Peruvian ruins though I'm not sure, someone told me that.Anyone who gets round to reading this review and who likes this film REALLY will want to check out Miyazaki's epic series Mirai Shounen Conan - Future Boy Conan - based on the short sci fi novel'The Incredible Tide' by Alexander key (novel is available online). Conan is basically a prototype for Laputa's Pazu and Shita. In addition you may not be familiar with his earlier work for Masterpiece Theatre - some of his key frame animation. He also did key frame for Sherlock Hound - this has some of the finest backgrounds I've ever seen too. Also check out Miyazaki and Takahata's first feature film Horus Prince of the Sun (1968) - amazing by today's standards in fact. What else.... Gauche the Cellist and The Flying Ghost Ship - though they're pretty rare.This film is such a gift, I don't know what we'd do without it with all this other crap storytelling around, this is like an oasis.

The sweeping vistas of the Texas plains, the rugged beauty of the characters, and the haunting score all combined to create a sense of longing and regret that lingers long after the credits roll. The story of Gus and Call, two former Texas Rangers, as they embark on a cattle drive from Texas to Montana, is a poignant exploration of the human condition, and the impermanence of life. As I sit here, reflecting on the film, I am struck by the themes of mortality, loss, and the fleeting nature of human connection. The characters in \"Lonesome Dove\" are all struggling to come to terms with their own mortality, and the impermanence of the world around them. Gus, in particular, is a complex and deeply flawed character, whose struggles to reconcile his past and present selves are both heartbreaking and deeply relatable. The film's portrayal of the Old West, with its dusty towns, rough-riding cowboys, and rugged landscape, is both beautiful and brutal. The harsh realities of life on the range, the dangers of the open road, and the cruelty of the world are all laid bare, and yet, despite the hardships, there is a deep sense of beauty and wonder that permeates the film. As I think about the characters, I am struck by the way they are all searching for something more, something that will bring them peace, happiness, and fulfillment. Gus, in particular, is driven by a deep sense of regret, and a longing to make amends for past mistakes.

The film's unique premise, where a young boy makes a wish to be \"big\" and wakes up the next morning to find himself in the body of a grown man, allows for a fresh exploration of themes such as childhood innocence, adult responsibility, and the challenges of navigating the world as an outsider. I think what makes \"Big\" truly great is the way it balances humor and heart. The film has a lighthearted, comedic tone that makes it easy to enjoy, but it also tackles some surprisingly deep and relatable themes.

The film's nostalgic value is also a big part of its appeal. The 1980s setting and the iconic soundtrack bring back memories of a bygone era, and the film's themes of childhood and growing up are universally relatable.

My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. \"Stargate SG-1\" is more than just a simple sci-fi series, it is one of the most well made, interesting, long running, exciting sci-fi ever produced. And why? Because it runs on an amazing premise.This series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and I think it is a very good example that television, as a medium, with a suitable premise, is able to provide something that doesn't work on the time restriction of film. The sense of familiarity created by a long running series, watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief, and it's all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show.\"Stargate SG-1\" kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years, but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show: - The first few seasons, perhaps up to the 4th/5th, focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending Goaul'd threat. - From the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the Goaul'd and preventing attacks on Earth. After this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg-1 in a place of Goaul'd/replicator/ori conflicts- The 8th season is probably the most mixed one. It has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned, but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments. - The 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no Jack O'Neil. They are both good continuations, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, because they seem to be about little more than SG-1 and human/Jaffa losing battle after battle to the Ori.Basically, after season 7, exploration was pushed to the background, which in many ways was a shame, because of the potential and mystery each planet(episode) presented; on the other hand, it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were.Even tough I believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest, the feeling I have is that it could go on; the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer. A last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome, but ultimately things are as they are.In the end, because of the fact that I enjoyed everything, it's a little hard to find that it ends.

{"original_text": "**A Quietly Powerful Exploration of Black Male Identity** \"Weekend\" is a poignant and intimate drama that masterfully captures the complexities of black male identity. Directed by Pascal Laugier and starring Kidron and Samuel Boateng, the film follows a tender and awkward encounter between two young men, Glen and Wendell, on a weekend getaway in Chicago. As they navigate their burgeoning feelings for each other, the film delves into themes of vulnerability, trust, and the societal pressures that shape their experiences. The film's greatest strength lies in its nuanced portrayal of its characters, who are multidimensional and relatable. The performances are genuine and heartfelt, bringing depth to the story. The cinematography is equally impressive, capturing the beauty of the city and the quiet moments between the characters. What sets \"Weekend\" apart is its unflinching honesty and sensitivity. The film tackles topics such as racism, homophobia, and the struggles of growing up black and gay with a level of authenticity that is both refreshing and necessary.

{"original_text": "Pinjar by Mr dwivedi is an awesome movie. Its definitely the greaest and finest of 2003. There are very good performances in it. Dwivedi knows what he can extract from MAST Urmila. she is like u have never seen before. one true great performance. along with her is a fine actor Manoj bajpai, who has shown bollywood what he is with Bhiku Mhatre. The movie is about a girl(Urmila) living in Pre-partition pakistan. she is from a punjabi family livin in a small town. she is been kidnapped by a muslim guy as a part of a going-on-for-years kinda fight with the punjabi family. and then follows a series of twists and turns as urmila's arranged marriage is due in few days. this movie is truly a very good movie. the storyline is solid with an amazing screenplay. all the performances like lillete dubey, isha koppikar (u wont believ but she can act as well besides jus dancin on Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many more. those sets with pre-partition pakistan, costumes, cinematography, sound, background score add to the positive points. from the start till the end u r stuck to u'r seat with the question whats next? this movie is not jus worth watchin but deserved to be a part of your movie collection. the ultimate scene is the end of the movie.

{"original_text": "Still being of school age, and having to learn Shakespeare almost constantly for the last four years (which is very off-putting of any writer, no matter how good), I didn't really expect to enjoy this film when my English teacher put it on; I thought it'd be the typical English lesson movie: bad acting, awfully shot, badly edited and the dreaded awful old dialog, so, as you can tell, I was all but ready to go into a coma from the go. However, I watched and, much to my disturbance, found myself not only paying attention, but actually enjoying the movie too. This production of Hamlet is possibly one of the best drama movies I have seen in a long time- and it really brings to life what I expect Shakespeare wanted his plays to be like (well, with the difference that this is cinema) much better than my English teacher harking over the text ever possibly could. The story is good, the dialog seems to flow with an unexpected grace that is far from boring (though a little hard to keep up with if you aren't used to Shakespeare's language) and even the smallest parts are performed with a skill you wouldn't expect; mainly, perhaps, due to the staggering number of cameos this movie has. Brian Blessed and Charlton Heston are as great as you'd expect these two veterans to be, even in such small parts, but it is Robin Williams as Osric and Billy Crystal as the Gravedigger who really stand out, giving such minor parts an unexpected zest, as well as offering some comic relief amidst the tragedy.The main stars, of course, are also wonderful. Kenneth Branagh excels as Hamlet, bringing not only the confusion and pain required to the roll, but also a sort of sardonic air which plays beautifully in the comic scenes, making the movie as a whole much more watchable. The other major players are also good, but it is Kenneth Branagh who stands head and shoulders above the rest in the title role.The set pieces, too, are often quite stunning, giving a refreshing change to the danky old castle corridors we're used to seeing in Shakespeare productions, as well as a real sense of the country around them.Of course, the movie, taken as a movie in its own right, is not without faults, but no major ones (the pacing is the only real problem I can think of offhand, as well as the prose for anyone not used to, as I said, Shakesperean language) and, especially when compared to the sort of Shakespeare productions I'm used to seeing in class, it really is quite brilliant. It's even made me rethink my previous typical teenager stance on Shakespeare, that his plays are boring (I came to the conclusion it's not the plays that are boring, merely the teachers who recite them in class).", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Still being of school age, and having to learn Shakespeare almost constantly for the last four years (which is very off-putting of any writer, no matter how good), I didn't really expect to enjoy this film when my English teacher put it on; I thought it'd be the typical English lesson movie: bad acting, awfully shot, badly edited and the dreaded awful old dialog, so, as you can tell, I was all but ready to go into a coma from the go.

Unfortunately, this sequel fails to recapture the magic of its predecessor. The plot is a jumbled mess, trying to cram too many subplots and characters into a meandering narrative that lacks focus. The dialogue is cringe-worthy at times, with characters speaking in stilted, unnatural ways that feel more like a parody of hip-hop culture than an authentic representation. The music, while still funky and upbeat, is overused and becomes grating after a while. The soundtrack, which was a highlight of the first film, feels like an afterthought here, with too much repetition and not enough creativity. The acting is similarly uninspired, with the usually reliable Eddie Murphy struggling to elevate his underwritten character. Overall, \"Superfly 2\" feels like a lazy cash-grab, relying on the goodwill of the original rather than putting in the effort to create a worthy sequel.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "\"Superfly\" was a sleeper hit when it was released in 2007, and its sequel feels like a lazy cash-grab, relying on the goodwill of the original rather than putting in the effort to create a worthy sequel.

I however am completely untouched, bored and cannot stop asking myself why the display of incoherent, inconsistent images which vaguely orbit around a central theme are considered an intellectual journey.What was this movie actually about? Growing sexuality in a woman? I've seen great films on this subject, but this is not one of them. How can one attempt to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person not only as a narrative device to dream (in the nude) of beasts. Where there are no characters, there is no character study. The woman persecuted by the beast was not adolescent, the girl having sex with the black butler (is he also characterized as a beast?) has a very grown up attitude to sexuality, so where is the consistency? Is it a movie about religion? If yes we would need a bit more thematic material than a priest without function, character and charisma, but with a strong desire towards two young boys.Is it about bestiality? The metaphoric feel of the movie forbids any realistic examination of bestiality, especially as realistic examination requires realistic characters. So no real bestiality here. Some mythic beast and two priests talking to each other about the sin of bestiality. Enough for a college essay on the topic? I don't think so.Is it about sex? Is it about anything? I don't know. I only know that showing a fired gun doesn't make a film a war movie. Dealing with a topic must mean more than displaying its own associations with the theme.So look across the controversy. Don't be scared by the bestiality, nudity, ejaculations, masturbation and stuff. I am not. Look at it as you look at any other story and you might discover that this is a poorly made, poorly edited, poorly acted, really poorly written (okay, some pictures are quite nice, and the main character is a really good looking girl) cerebral masturbation of a director who thinks beating around the bush in a hypnotic slow manner will make a story intelligent.

{"original_text": "I think this film has been somewhat overrated here. There are some things to admire in it; for one thing it deserves credit for being a science fiction(ish) film which relies on its story instead of special effects and action sequences to carry the day. The supporting cast is good, the set design and cinematography are good, and the ideas are interesting enough (though they are beginning to seem a little tired after the many mediocre Dark City / Memento / Fight Club clones of recent years). But the film is undone by poor characterization, wooden performances from the lead actors, and a laughably bad ending.The main problem I had was that the protagonist was neither likable nor unlikable. I realize that part of the story dictates that he should be a bit of a (wait for it...) cipher, but I was utterly unable to work up any empathy for a character that just seemed like a boring, anonymous schlub of a man. What character transformation there is for this sad sack is artificially forced on him by the plot. Lead actor Jeremy Northam succeeds in conveying that the protagonist is confused and hapless, but fails at inspiring any sympathy for him. Opposite him, Lucy Liu does what she can with a character who has no real personality of her own, unless being the embodiment of a spy-movie clich\u00e9 counts as personality.One of the biggest disappointments of this movie is the ending. I won't give any spoilers here, but I will say that a surprise twist at the end was telegraphed pretty clearly at least 45 minutes before it occurred. Further, after being content to be a quirky, idea-oriented movie for the first hour or so, the last few scenes suddenly and terribly devolve into the worst kind of Hollywood pap, complete with big explosions and special effects. The revealing of the film's McGuffin at the end is poorly done, and at the end the characters seem even less likable than they did before some of the film's main plot threads were resolved.The movie's not all bad, though. It does manage to maintain a certain low level of tension throughout most of it, despite the slow pacing (although I think I have a higher than average tolerance for slow-paced movies). And there are some moments when the unsettled, paranoiac feeling that director Vincenzo Natali was clearly trying to evoke rises to the surface. But in the end, these elements aren't enough to overcome the flaws in the film's acting and script.

Further, after being content to be a quirky, idea-oriented movie for the first hour or so, the last few scenes suddenly and terribly devolve into the worst kind of Hollywood pap, complete with big explosions and special effects. The revealing of the film's McGuffin at the end is poorly done, and at the end the characters seem even less likable than they did before some of the film's main plot threads were resolved.The movie's not all bad, though. It does manage to maintain a certain low level of tension throughout most of it, despite the slow pacing (although I think I have a higher than average tolerance for slow-paced movies). And there are some moments when the unsettled, paranoiac feeling that director Vincenzo Natali was clearly trying to evoke rises to the surface. But in the end, these elements aren't enough to overcome the flaws in the film's acting and script. There is probably a good movie that covers these same themes and ideas, but this isn't it."}

The store was incredibly busy, with multiple customers vying for attention from the same few sales associates, who seemed overwhelmed and struggling to keep up with demand. The mattress selection was vast, but the lack of clear signage and organization made it difficult to navigate and find what I was looking for. The furniture section was similarly disorganized, with pieces scattered haphazardly throughout the store and no clear layout or pricing information. To make matters worse, the store was filled with the overwhelming smell of chemicals and new materials, which made my head spin and left me feeling dizzy. The overall atmosphere was unpleasant and stressful, making it difficult for me to relax and enjoy the shopping experience.

{"original_text": "This gripping tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a sharper picture and crisper sound. My only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are difficult at times. Luckily even missing a word here and there won't spoil the fun: the primary actors are ideally cast. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, a go-for-broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable; her acting rivals her beauty. (The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them!) Each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well. The mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally improved by viewing \"Reckless\" -- but you'll have plenty of fun.

Shin-ae is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of Milyang ('Secret Sunshine' in Chinese) from Seoul with her young son.

The bar has an outside covered patio which is nice for enjoying the lovely Florida weather. I always appreciate a bar where I can sit outside and people watch and get some fresh air. With the bar being at the base of the high rise residential Element, there is surely a good amount of people watching to occur. There is metered street parking or if you visit on the weekend, you're in luck: free on street parking in metered spots. The bar has pool tables and dart boards as well as TV trivia for the guests entertainment. There are well, beer, and martini specials everyday during their happy hour from 12-7pm. I would be sure to ask your bartender about the offerings, as they are not readily posted. If hunger strikes when you are there, there is a list of local restaurants and food options in the area, and those that deliver are marked. Duckweed Urban Market is a few doors down and you can get quick snacks or prepared meals from there. All in all, I enjoyed my pleasant experience at the bar.

It might be worth noting that Paddywagon won the award for the best Bloody Mary from the 2015 Bloody Mary festival this year. Props to them and this nice addition to the downtown scene.

Simon, who adapted the script from his play (which goes uncredited), equates old age with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for 43 years, which begs the question \"how long did vaudeville last, anyway?\"). Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of Neil Simon's screenplays; here, Ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent Matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to tone down the character, to nuance his temperament to give \"The Sunshine Boys\" some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf.

The film tells the story of General Frank Savage (Gregory Peck), a seasoned pilot tasked with taking command of the 918th Bomb Group, a struggling unit plagued by low morale and poor performance. Peck shines as the tough-as-nails Savage, bringing a depth and nuance to the character that makes him both relatable and formidable. The supporting cast, including Dean Jagger and Millard Mitchell, deliver strong performances that add to the film's emotional resonance. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the intensity and chaos of aerial combat with stunning realism. What truly sets \"12 O'Clock High\" apart, however, is its thought-provoking exploration of the psychological toll of war on its participants. The film's themes of leadership, responsibility, and the human cost of conflict are timeless and universally relevant.

{"original_text": "**Amarcord: A Timeless and Poignant Coming-of-Age Masterpiece** Federico Fellini's \"Amarcord\" is a cinematic treasure that has aged remarkably well, its themes of nostalgia, identity, and the fragility of human connection remaining as poignant and relatable today as they were when the film was released in 1973. Set in the director's hometown of Rimini during the fascist era, the film is a semi-autobiographical account of Fellini's own childhood, and it's a testament to his genius that he was able to distill the essence of his youth into such a beautifully rendered and deeply personal work. The film's narrative is a loose collection of vignettes, each one capturing a moment or memory from the protagonist's childhood, as he navigates the complexities of adolescence and grapples with the changing world around him. The performances are pitch-perfect, with the young Pippo Strecci delivering a standout turn as the wide-eyed and impressionable protagonist. Fellini's direction is, as always, masterful, his use of color, composition, and camera movement creating a dreamlike atmosphere that perfectly captures the sense of wonder and confusion that defines childhood. \"Amarcord\" is a must-see for anyone who has ever experienced the bittersweet pangs of nostalgia, and it's a powerful reminder of the enduring power of cinema to capture and convey the human experience.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Federico Fellini's \"Amarcord\" is a coming-of-age masterpiece that has aged remarkably well, its themes of nostalgia, identity, and the fragility of human connection remaining as poignant and relatable today as they were when the film was released in 1973. ** Amarcord: A Timeless and Poignant Coming-of-10-year-old Masterpiece** Federico F Coppola's latest film, \"The Beguiled\", opens in cinemas across the country on Friday, but it's a classic from the director of \"The Godfather\" and \"Apocalypse Now\" that's making its way to the big screen this week."}

This has got to be the most unintentionally funny movie I've seen in a loooong time. The plot is fairly straightforward: Racheal's (Monica Calhoun) sister is killed by a band of brigands (Led by Bobby Brown!) and, like many an action movie before this, she straps on her guns ONE LAST TIME and vows to avenge her sisters death. To do this, she reassembles the titular Gang of Roses (supposedly based on a true story of a female gang) and they go out and exact revenge and, along the way, there's some subplot or something or other about some gold that might be buried in the town. One nice thing I will say about this movie is that from what I could tell, the stars did their own riding and they looked GREAT galloping.The funniest (albiet unintentionally funny) scenes? Look for when they introduce Stacy Dash's character or when Calhoun's character rescinds her vow not to strap on her guns (replete with a clenched fisted cry to the heavens) or Lil' Kim's character joking with Lisa Raye's character or Stacy Dash's character being killed or Lil' Kim's character convincing Lisa Raye's character to rejoin the gang or the Asian Chick or Macy Grey's character talking bout \"The debt is paid\", etc. With the exception of Calhoun's Racheal and Bobby Brown's Left-Eye, I can't even remember the names of the other characters cuz I was laughing so hard when they were introduced.If the director had gone for parody and broad comedy this would have been a great movie.

The movie tries to place the blame with Karadzic, who had been a Presidential candidate and leader of the Bosnian Parliament's 2nd Largest Party(SDP).

{"original_text": "Well, where to begin? I guess I can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed. Call me ignorant for not knowing of Schneebaum's book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that I have been living under some kind of a rock, but don't blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this \"documentary\" is actually a companion to said book. Yeah, I felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why I sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a \"Modern Cannibal Tale.\" I mean, am I a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes? I certainly didn't expect an hour and forty-five minutes of one old geezer kissing his own ass by whining about every little detail of his dull and worn out life. I certainly didn't expect the insipid directing and I most notably did not foresee myself laughing so hard at Tobias Schneebaum and all of his off-putting glory.Schneebaum is indeed unlikable. The old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of his even though he isn't even that interesting a character to fill a story. Oh really? He was a cannibal? Ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding Schneebaum's dirty past. The only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when Tobias finally breaks his little silent treatment about what happened to him in Peru and say that he had \"a small piece.\" That's it, folks. Ninety minutes of bull later and Tobias Schneebaum is a cannibal by three inches. It's like calling a movie \"The Life Of A True Don Juan\" only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when he once played \"just the tip.\" Unbelievable.The directing is, indeed, superbly ghastly as there is no flow or rhythm to the story that is being told. Alright, I understand that I didn't read Schneebaum's volume before watching his celluloid tale of it, but I can still recognize some bad pacing and even worse editing. One minute Schneebaum is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next he's going on and on about how he can't drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative or some failed and miserable saga in his life. I mean, Jesus, can you at least slam his back story to the first part; follow up with some stuff covering his homosexuality and then end it off with a hearty look into his visit to Peru? Also: I don't particularly care much for Schneebaum's insipid little quips on life and living, but I at least implore the old man to keep consistent with his ramblings. If I hear a guy talking about how he prefers life in the jungle I don't expect him to suddenly bitch and moan about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later. Absurd.Another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which our hero has appeared. While some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story, the director has overused the gimmick and broken his entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reels.The bottom line, here, is that Tobias Schneebaum is a fraud. Pure and simple. I know that I haven't read the book, but I'm still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own. This documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an avid fan of Schneebaum's work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a DVD. Schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy, striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that his story is remarkably un-riveting. If you're looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism, turn away because \"Keep The River To Your Right\" is an embarrassingly hilarious self-serving rant over a man who is long overdue for a straight-jacket and a gag.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Well, where to begin?

An example of the directing: When Candy (Jean Peters) starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing, an alarm goes off in the background in the building she's in -- as if it's an alarm going off in her head. It's not cartoon-like -- it's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you've seen the film a few times and it just \"clicks\" that there's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag.Richard Widmark is way on top of his game as a smart-alec -- he's really great -- but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for \"Moe,\" the street peddler/informer, played by Thelma Ritter. Later, in her apartment, you are not seeing a movie -- you're seeing a real person. I've never seen anyone \"act\" so real I felt like I was looking into a real room until Ritter's performance -- right down to the way her hair stuck out a bit when she removed her hat. About a million other things just *worked,* from the way Lightning Louie picks up money with his chopsticks to the way Candy's jewelry clicks when she flicks Moe's hand away from her brooch, to the way Moe gets the dollars and change from the police captain across the FBI guy's chest -- and even the way the captain opens his filing cabinet, like he's been doing it in that way in that room for many years. \"Pickup On South Street\" is detailed moves (directing) with consummate performances (acting) and superb now-nostalgic visuals of the day, such as the panel truck, the boards leading to the shack out on the water, the dumbwaiter, -- and the unforgettable place Skip stashes his pocket pickings. Wonderful stuff.\"Pickup On South Street\" is also one of the few movies where, even though the characters aren't perfect, you do care about them -- perhaps because they have been somewhat branded by their pasts in ways that are hard to escape: Skip as a \"three-time loser\" and Candy as a youngish woman who has \"knocked around\" a lot. When these people behave a little more badly than you'd expect, it's in sort of novel ways that make it seem you're looking in at people you'd never otherwise imagine -- and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so recognizably human.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made.

The voice cast is equally impressive, with a standout performance from Robin Williams as the lovable and mischievous Tinker Bell. His chemistry with the rest of the cast, particularly Jason Alexander and Minnie Driver, is undeniable and adds depth to the story. The real magic, however, lies in the film's themes of childhood innocence, the importance of imagination, and the power of friendship. It's a reminder that even as we grow older, we should never lose our sense of wonder and curiosity.

{"original_text": "Although only a short distance from the French Quarter, Frenchman Street is like stepping into a different realm. It's only two-blocks long but full of life and non-stop entertainment and on any given day of the week, you can hear the live sounds of reggae to Latin to blues. To kick off a night on Frenchman Street, it's best to do so on a full stomach so stopped into Mojitos Rum Bar and Grill on the edge of Frenchman Street for dinner and a warm up to a night out on the town. Just like a lot of the other places in the area, Mojitos has their own live entertainment and if u stay late enough on Saturdays a Latin music party. All of this takes place on their beautiful patio but you also do have the option of indoor dining but I highly recommend that you do not do that. Even consider sitting at their large outdoor bar before doing that. Going to a place called Mojitos means you have to get a Mojito. Due to their namesake, they have plenty of options from specialty drinks to the typical fruit flavor kind. I started off with The Frenchman which was amazing and thank fully strong. Later on, I decided to get another drink and selected the Ultimate Mojito. I know it said mint syrup and I don't know what I was thinking but it was the ultimate fail. It tasted just like syrup, medicine syrup. If you'bout that sizzrup, this may be the drink for you. We order the Jerk Chicken Skewer as a starter and it was so unbelievable delicious! Do you know how hard it is to go to a place that doesn't specialize in Jamaican food and for them to actually get it right? The flavors were on point and the spice level was beyond expectations. To offset the spicy factor, the blackberry brandy sauce added just the right touch. There are only four choices for main dishes, but they all sounded so good, I still had a hard time deciding. I ended up ordering the Aruba Scallop. It came with grits and I am actually NOT a fan of grits but these were well flavored and a great compliment to the delicate and well cooked and prepared scallops. A dish like this has potential to lack flavor, but it was really good and had a nice kick to it. My boyfriend ordered the Lechon Asado or as the menu states, citrus marinated roasted Kurobota pork belly. The meal was served with rice and beans. He thought it was really good taste wise, but was disappointed in the portion size which I guess was a little small but I was full after eating my meal.

An element that is different between the two directors is that Villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic, gritty realism opposed to Almodovar's use of surrealism, although both styles are similar.The piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature.

{"original_text": "**A Timeless Masterpiece that Still Sizzles** Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger deliver tour-de-force performances in this powerful and thought-provoking drama, \"In the Heat of the Night\". Directed by Norman Jewison, this 1967 classic is a masterclass in storytelling, character development, and social commentary. The film's narrative is expertly woven, slowly unraveling the complexities of racial tensions and small-town politics in the Deep South. Poitier, as Detective Virgil Tibbs, brings a quiet intensity to his portrayal of a city-bred black detective who finds himself in the midst of a murder investigation in a small, predominantly white town. Steiger, as Sheriff Gillespie, is equally impressive, bringing a sense of gravitas and vulnerability to his character. The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable, and their scenes together are some of the most memorable in the film. The film's themes of racial inequality, prejudice, and social justice are just as relevant today as they were upon its release.

{"original_text": "**A Patriotic Punch to the Gut: \"Rocky IV\" Still Packs a Punch** Sylvester Stallone's \"Rocky IV\" is a masterclass in cinematic machismo, a cinematic embodiment of American grit and determination that still resonates today. Released in 1985, this installment of the beloved franchise finds Rocky Balboa (Stallone) facing off against the formidable Soviet Union, specifically the towering Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), a formidable boxer with a penchant for destruction. The film's Cold War backdrop adds a layer of tension and relevance, making Rocky's battle against Drago a metaphor for the struggle between East and West. Stallone's direction is confident and unapologetic, capturing the raw emotion and physicality of the boxing matches with stunning clarity. The supporting cast, including Carl Weathers and Talia Shire, deliver solid performances, but it's the chemistry between Stallone and Lundgren that truly makes the film sizzle. The film's themes of patriotism, perseverance, and the underdog spirit are timeless, making \"Rocky IV\" a classic that continues to inspire and entertain audiences. While some may find the film's jingoism and over-the-top drama a bit dated, the film's core message and Stallone's unwavering dedication to the character remain undiminished.

The film attempts to recapture the suspense and terror of Hitchcock's masterpiece, but falls short. The story is convoluted and lacks the eerie atmosphere that made the first film so effective.

As I watched the American flag (50 stars in 1864?) being dragged behind the horse, I realized why burning that piece of red white and blue doesn't upset me as much as our destruction/indifference to the Bill of Rights. I'm a Southerner, and must have some historical memory.Watching the Tobey McGuire character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave, as he looks at the scalps of blacks and Germans (his ethnic background) being wagered at a poker game.....was interesting. Many twists in this movie. The wife, who is forced into her marriage, shows both lust and a strong will, characteristics we're not used to seeing in'respectable Victorian southern belles'.The crazy wacked out renegade southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin, head of the Copeland Horse-thieving Gang, Inc. in Mississippi, was hung about that time. Bands of homeless men were roaming the countryside, armed. Remind you of Iraq? And how similar we are underneath the facade of religion and ethnic background? And why southerners are STILL fighting that civil war today.Too bad we can't use that same knowledge in our handling of the country we've just invaded and are occupying, fomenting civil war everywhere. That's Mesopotamia, now called Iraq, who happen to have the misfortune to sit on oil. The wild-eyed killers in Missouri, raiding Lawrence, Kansas could as easily be the insurgents we're fighting now with no success.Another anomaly was the father's tribute to the Yankees who move into Lawrence and erect a school \"even before they erect a church. And for that reason, they'll win.\" Huh????? I was taught history in Birmingham, Al and we were taught that the North was much more industrial and richer.....that's why they won. Course, they also LITERALLY had God on their side. As you see here, when the freed slave indicates that he's cutting out to free his mother, sold into slavery in Texas. God, what a horrible legacy slavery gave us.Acting pretty good, lots of blood and gore as the warriors ride gleefully into battle (but didn't hear any rebel yells, so reminiscent of football games in Alabama). You also get a real feeling for how stupid the war was, as the bushwackers and jayhawkers gather their forces for another raid. They have lost sight of why they're fighting, and so do we. Just more mindless slaughter.You're also brought up to date with the limbless kids coming home from Iraq, as the bushwacker (ahh, what connotations) first has his arm seared shut, trying to save it, then has it amputated, and then dies. So much suffering for such a stupid cause.The cinematography is fantastic. Now I have to get back to the DVD and get the production notes, one of my favorite parts of any movie. I suspect that this movie was written by a Gore Vidal, as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era, if you knew History. The dialogue is definitely thought-provoking. Not your ordinary blood and guts war movie, by any means. You see the wounded but still active-duty soldiers, still fighting cause they have nothing else to do. You see the southern raiders, living off the land, stealing indiscriminately. Yet, at the beginning, you've seen the battle stop, so the women could be evacuated from danger. As I read the escalating number of women and children dying in Iraq, I'm thinking, \"Where did we lose our sense of honor as a people?\" I have forgotten why I sought this movie out and bought it after 20 years, but some book somewhere lauded it.

The reason is that the event planning team was disorganized and lacked attention to detail.

Context: It was our Golden Anniversary last night, 6 years on the 6th.... We had just briefly met Exec. Chef Casey Frank at an event this last Thursday, and decided to celebrate at Livery as we'd been meaning to stop by for awhile now. It seems he must have 1.) seen us come in; 2.) recognized who we were from the event; and 3.) remembered we had mentioned it was our anniversary that night - because after we placed our order of a salad and two entrees, the server came back out and informed us we should \"...forget about your order\" and wait for the experience Chef had lined up for us.... What followed was an astounding 8-course small plate journey, with some of the most delicious and memorable flavor profiles we've encountered in Indianapolis. Chef Casey came out on two occasions to chat with us about the food and make sure we were having a good time. We felt like nothing short of royalty at 6:30pm on a Sunday. Food: (I'll highlight just a few dishes so as not to write a novel) Sweet Plantains were culinary genius. Sweetness of the plantain, saltiness of black bean puree, spice from the habanero guajillo sauce, and brininess of the pickled onion in the pineapple salsa were perfectly balanced. The combinations were so complex, but you could still individually identify each component and the role they played in the dish. Pork Tenderloin could be cut with a fork and was full of flavor. Slight char on the outside gave it smoke, which was complemented by an incredible sweet corn puree and spicy serrano hot sauce. Scallop was the most well-prepared I've had in a long time. Perfect golden-brown sear on the outside, and so tender with not one bite of grit.... A feat that, in my book, is quite an accomplishment! Served with a roasted carrot and poblano pico garnish, it was another masterful balance of sweet and heat while letting the seafood shine. Churros were a playful and well-executed nod to Latin street fare. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a wonderful caramel sauce that was obviously made in-house. Service: Our server Tommy was a delight, from the first moment when he brought us 2 complimentary champagnes to toast. Friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive, he engaged my wife and I just enough to provide quality service and make sure everything was in order, while giving us privacy to enjoy each other's company. We very much enjoyed his service! I honestly don't know what we did to deserve such a gift, but sincere and heartfelt thanks - To Chef Casey, Tommy, and Livery - for making our Golden Anniversary so very special.

{"original_text": "This film was made and cast from my home town. I remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the fact Molly Ringwald was in town...Storyline...Essentially 20 years after a film was \"laid to rest\" without being finished, a group of film students set out to complete it - with dire consequences. It would seem someone does not want the film completed.The storyline is flimsy. One has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek, but it had no real oomph. The characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just don't care about, it seems irrelevant. It is weird hearing Kylie's accent as Australian again and nice to see a kid I went to school with in a starring role. But that doesn't redeem the film at all. Goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in Molly Ringwald. Perhaps due to the nature of the film (it sort of pays homage to 80s films / bad horror films)but really an Aussie actor would have done just fine.As far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed constipated. Some of these kids (especially the two main chics - they played \"director\" and \"producer\") looked like they were trying to act. That is never a good look. Also, the shots had a rough feel about them. Over lit perhaps? Just not as smooth as one is used to.The killer. Lord. Could it be less frightening? There are some shock factors though, and a couple of gross scenes. I did like the film, but it was not great. It went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less. Perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better. They had a lot of characters get killed - but no real build up to them getting slayed.

Anyway, the check in process was smooth and it seems to be a thing at this hotel to walk guests to the right elevators. Pretty slick...the elevators were problematic a time or two (not working correctly), but I kind of chalk that up to new hotel bugs. The whole feel of the hotel is kind of natural modern...kind of a midwestern twist on scandanavian design. Lots of wood and organic items around the hotel. Very comfortable, very lovely. The room was great - I was put in a nice room on the concierge level. Huge space, great furniture, comfortable bed, no issues with the internet and a really over the top shower with multiple spray heads, etc. Judging by the photos below, I think the rooms on the concierge level might be a little bigger than the standard rooms...but, it's good to have Marriott Status!

{"original_text": "**A Grandiose Epic with a Flawed Hero** \"El Cid\" is a sweeping historical epic that brings to life the legendary tale of Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, a 11th-century Spanish warrior known as El Cid. Directed by Anthony Mann, the film boasts stunning cinematography, lavish sets, and a strong performance from Charlton Heston in the title role. The story follows El Cid's rise to fame as a skilled fighter and his eventual rebellion against the King of Castile, leading to a complex and tumultuous relationship with his wife, Jimena (Sophia Loren). While the film's grand scale and attention to historical detail are impressive, the narrative is marred by a somewhat one-dimensional portrayal of El Cid as a hero. The character's motivations and emotions are often reduced to simplistic tropes, making it difficult to fully invest in his journey. Additionally, the pacing can be slow and plodding at times, bogging down the film's momentum. Despite these flaws, \"El Cid\" remains a visually stunning and entertaining epic that is sure to please fans of historical dramas.

One of the film's weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from Pretty Woman. Why? Does it hurt to attempt some originality, Abbas? Mustan? Anyone?The film is about a newly married couple, Raj and Priya (Salman - Rani). Priya cannot conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy, and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother, who will carry their child. They pick Madhubala, a vulgar prostitute played by Preity Zinta. The film is not really realistic, I mean, isn't it easier to adopt? And even if they pick a girl, does it mean the man has to sleep with her? Have you heard of insemination? Anyway, I guess if the writers had heard of all this, the film wouldn't have been made, so the concept is apparently intentional.Salman acts very well. It's nice to see him playing a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love to his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman.

She lives the film, emotes and makes you love her and admire her at the same time, partly because of her role, partly because of her magnetic and positive personality.

{"original_text": "I first came across this film when I read a book (written in the 1970s) about the career of Mitchell Leisin. I have to admit that over the years I have watched many of his films and find his best work really high quality. SWING HIGH, SWING LOW was supposed to be one of his best. While it did not bore me, it did not impress me as much as HOLD BACK THE DAWN, DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY, KITTY, or even GOLDEN EARINGS. I suspect it just dates too much now to be well liked.Working at Paramount Leisin had a problem in those films that he did which were musicals. Most of the scores he worked with were fairly mediocre. It's true that twice standards appeared in his films, but they were really rare cases: \"Cocktales for Two\" appeared in MURDER AT THE VANITIES, and \"Mona Lisa\" came out of CAPTAIN CAREY, U.S.A. But the rest of the score for MURDER AT THE VANITIES was forgettable. \"Mona Lisa\" was the only tune in CAPTAIN CAREY. It shouldn't have been this way - Leisin's studio had Rogers and Hart working for it in the early 1930s. Why couldn't he have been assigned to a project with them? The score for SWING HIGH, SWING LOW, is pleasant but forgettable. Unfortunately, the movie is centered in the entertainment world, as Fred Macmurray demonstrates great talents as a trumpet player (he even works Carole Lombard into his act by looping his arms around her when he blows his trumpet). The song (sung by Lombard) about how her lover's playing thrills her, is important to the plot. It works in the film, but it would have been better if the song was more memorable.There is a picaresque style to the film - it begins on an ocean liner that Lombard works on, as a manicurist. She is constantly being bullied by her boss Franklin Pangborn (the ship's barber). Then the ship is entering into the Panama Canal, and we see MacMurray as a soldier, who's enlistment is ending shortly. Their first scene together has a nice Leisin touch in it: MacMurray is talking to Lombard, she on the deck of the boat and he on the edge of the wall of the lock. Nice way to keep the action going while the dialog hits a dull bit.The film follows the rise and fall of the Skid Johnson (MacMurray) as he meets Lombard, and begins his reputation as a trumpet player, but meets the \"other woman\" in the film, Dorothy Lamore. The best moments in the film deal with the collapse of the relationship with Lombard, and his collapse as a jazz trumpeter (his appearance and need for alcohol is very untypical for a MacMurray character - even his darker figures like Walter Neff or Mr. Sheldrake or the naval officer who pushes the Caine Mutiny did not demonstrate a reliance on alcohol.Lombard is good as the woman loved but wronged by MacMurray. Lamore has little to really do - possibly the film had more scenes with her in it, but one stands out is her attempt to get MacMurray onto the wagon again. In his opening bit Pangborn is fine. Rarely noticed in films, small part actor Carl Judels is effective as a fair weather fan/friend of MacMurray, who drops him as he goes under (though he gives him a hand-out).Charles Butterworth is as trivial in this film as usual, but he does have one moment when he looks sheepishly at his hands on the keyboard of a piano in the rooms he, his girlfriend, MacMurray, and Lombard share - his red faced appearance is due to embarrassment about a lie that MacMurray is insisting is true. It was a nice, subtle moment.

{"original_text": "This film was an interesting take by Hollywood on the novel by of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes, for the time the very idea of Chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself. I found that the white actors playing Chinese was not as bad as I expected, that it wasn't the Asian equivalent of blackface. Back then there were not really any Asian actors in America (not even George Takei was acting) and Rainer did a good job with her part. It wasn't the greatest performance I have ever seen but for old-school pre-method acting it was nice.

While some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes, for the time the very idea of Chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself. I found that the white actors playing Chinese was not as bad as I expected, that it wasn't the Asian equivalent of blackface. Back then there were not really any Asian actors in America (not even George Takei was acting) and Rainer did a good job with her part. It wasn't the greatest performance I have ever seen but for old-school pre-method acting it was nice.

This is a little gem of a picture, not least because a resource-depleted future is a reality for us 21st Century citizens. The low-budget opening titles of this movie are great: set to music, a low-tech'tape-slide' sequence composed entirely of archive stills from the dawn of photography right up to 1973, depicts an unspoiled American pastoral developing into a polluted and crowded Hell in less than 2 minutes. Succinct and unambiguous, it's truly memorable. Budget limitations are also behind rather unimaginative cinematography and other constraints, at odds with the story's brilliant premise.

The budget probably all went on trying to'futurise' the Soylent Executive's'Chelsea West' apartment with state-of-the art goodies, meaning the other costumes are perfunctory, some establishing shots are bizarrely underpopulated and the daytime exteriors seemingly all shot through a smoke filter.The memorable scene where Sol and Thorn (Charlton Heston) share a meal of expensive and rare food neatly summarises their society: They enjoy real bourbon, lettuce, celery, tomato, apple, and beef, and we really sense their lip-smacking appreciation of someone else's wealthy privileges.Robinson's pivotal death scene, in which his character is willingly euthenased at a place called'Home', depicts him immersed in images of the world's once-beautiful flora and fauna as he remembered them, beautifully contrasted with the jaundiced Thorn's dawning realization that the future has been bankrupted, among other horrors.This is one smart film, and its core message is as pertinent today as it was in the early 70s.

Why it won the Academy Award was because it was so shocking at that time that Hollywood, brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned, wanted to celebrate that fact. Filmmakers then were like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store.

{"original_text": "As we all know the sub-genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded. Simply being excessively raunchy isn't enough anymore. I've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days.Coming into the 40 Year Old Virgin I knew basically what to expect; I did see the commercials after all; \"is it true that if you don't use it, you lose it?\" What I didn't expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development. There's still the weird \"off-the-wall\" characters that we see so much in Adam Sandler movies and there's still enough inappropriate language to sink Noah's Ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message.The main character Andy is (unfortunately for me) a person I can relate to. In the first shot I see that he even shares my love for Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a poster for the movie on his wall) and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities. Andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology. Andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. Most importantly of all; Andy is a nice person, he doesn't swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them. Combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he's a serial murderer. It's like my life story.The other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way Andy does. I felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since Andy and his girlfriend Trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie.I suppose since I mentioned one flaw I might as well bring the other noticeable one to light. The story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go; it's quite simple. It deals with Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what's going to happen in the end. Sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know what's going to happen in the end, and I assure you it does. These are definitely small stains on the movie but there's so much good here that I can easily ignore it's few faults.When I say \"good\" I mean \"bad\" of course. This is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad. For the most part I think it succeeded. There are so many hilarious scenes such as Andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or the scene where Andy goes with his Trish's daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else. Ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence \"Ooh! Como se llama!\" An interesting little note about that scene; the actor Steve Carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real. Of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part.Actually since we're talking about Steve Carell, I'd like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since I didn't even know who he was prior to seeing this film. I was just so impressed by his writing, acting and timing that I now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles. This man has talent it The 40 Year Old Virgin proves that.To be honest I had doubts about this film but early word was positive and I knew it was something I was eventually going to see. I'm glad that I did too since it's probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching.

Not many tables available; and, the open tables were not clean. Red flag for me. I cleaned our table of choice and held back my opinion about it. Later our order taker cleaned off the rest of the tables, and did a mediocre job of sweeping the floors. Not bad, but enough to make you ask yourself how well they manage their crew. Okay, on with the food. They called out our order and the Quesadillas came out piping hot. We had to wait a few minutes to eat them. Each 12\" Quesadilla was served on a tray lined with foil. A handful of lettuce graced the presence of the correlating international sauce (eg. Italian, Greek, Mexican), served in a small cup. Tzatkiki, for example, with the Greek. I opened the Greek and it was steaming hot with gooey cheese, black olives, and banana pepper. I added lettuce for more depth. The flavors were mild, but tasty. Nothing that really wowed me or that I could not make at home. I ate half and took the rest home. The New Orleans style was made with blackened chicken, red pepper and bacon nestled in melted cheese (of which he could not recall). He said he liked it. That was all.

{"original_text": "I haven't yet read Kurt Vonnegut's Mother Night (though I've read other books of his, all outstanding pieces of satire and game-changing novel pieces). After seeing Keith Gordon's film adaptation of his book, it will be an immediate must-read in the near future. It's the kind of material that I'm sure if it wasn't made in 1995/96 as a film, it would be picked up right away today in the time period when many period post/present-Holocaust/WW2 movies are quite popular. Except that this is much darker, though even more resonant, about the nature of playing roles and the real underlying horror of living with life after war than say The Reader. It's about the very real danger of pretending in wartime, which is what being a spy in WW2 is really all about.It would be one thing if Mother Night had a script with a lot of emotional depth and complexity about the moral choice and constant role- even after the war ends- for Howard W. Cambpell (Nick Nolte), which is does. But it's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique. Keith Gordon is not someone I usually think of as a director of really strong material (more-so I think back to him as an actor, oddly enough featured briefly with Vonnegut himself in Back to School), but this is a revelation. He takes the story of Campbell as a story of a fractured life: a German propaganda master (the \"only American left in Berlin\"), who is actually a spy for the Americans but can never have his identity revealed, and was before a playwright who really belonged to \"a nation of two\", himself and his wife (Sheryl Lee). It follows him from his prison cell, awaiting trial in Israel in 1961, as he writes his memoir and tells of his disillusionment about being a'pretend' Nazi, and then in 1960 in semi-hiding in a New York apartment, which is where the bulk of the film takes place.Mother Night can be quite heavy, like on a level one might associate with the Pianist, but on another more emotional-cerebral level than the stark poetry of that film. Gordon, by way of Vonnegut, is trying to give us a strong look at a man who has nothing, except the memory (and then later a weird transposition) of his long lost love in a \"sister\" who has come back to him in NYC, so he's left to his own devices when he befriends a painter (Alan Arkin, very very good here), and then is found out as a Nazi-in-hiding by a white supremacist newsletter, leading wackos to his apartment. On the surface this should be just a straightforward spy story, but not a thing is straightforward. The'something' of this man's life is staggering, but it's ultimately of his own choosing. Campbell is one of those characters that could be analyzed for hours on end, but the same conclusions might be reached (and, in a way, mirrors the line Goebbels said): the bigger the lie, the more people believe it. That is except for the select few who started the lie and know its secret and power.But oh, it would be one thing if it were just a wonderful and tragic-comic tale, or another if it were featuring some really fantastic performances (which is does: Nolte is at his very best here, and Sheryl Lee, who we might remember from Twin Peaks as Laura Palmer, stuns in multiple roles, especially in the scene when she reveals she's not'really' Helga). It's also a gorgeously shot film, with brilliant lighting and shots that reflect the state of mind of the character, or just the starkness or sickening colors of the time (watch the scene where an old Campbell watches a film of his younger self spouting out a rant, the juxtaposition of faces is great). And the music selections rise the level of tragedy. It could be argued some of the music is too much, but at other times it elevates the material past its own usual dramatic dimensions and makes it operatic, solemn about human nature.It's not always an easy film to take emotionally, and some of the twists do have that tinge of \"whoa\" as in any spy story. But it's the subversion from Vonnegut that sticks through, the way of taking appearance and performance, of life imitating art imitating life imitating death, and making it into something worth remembering. I have no idea just yet if the book is better than the film (or the other way around), but at the moment it's hard for me not to recommend this to anyone looking for a masterpiece of post WW2/holocaust storytelling.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I haven't yet read Kurt Vonnegut's Mother Night (though I've read other books of his, all outstanding pieces of satire and game-changing novel pieces).

{"original_text": "I saw this film after watching Capote and Infamous. It is just incredible how the homosexual relationships between author and protagonists are sublimated in the movie. The reporter is straight, the protagonists are more beatniks than gay.The film starts slowly, but on reviewing it a second time, we get all sorts of interesting information from similes that the writer/director Brooks creates.Notice the incredible cutting at the beginning where killers and to-be-killed are linked. Cutter on the phone is matched-cut to Perry on the phone. Cutter washing his face is matched-cut to Perry washing his face. Only Perry's looking in the mirror and seeing his eroticized male body sets off a fantasy of his playing a guitar in Las Vegas to empty chairs. This failure/fantasy matches the failure-fantasy that Perry tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in Alaska only to find it perpetually empty.Dick talks about shooting pheasants and the fact that the pheasants don't know that that they're going to die. we cut to the Clutters.Perry talks his dream about a yellow bird, \"Taller than Jesus\" who attacks the Nuns who have persecuted them. \"The Nuns begged for mercy,\" he tells us, \"But the bird slaughtered them anyway.\" The bird lifted Perry to paradise. Strangely, Perry says that he has an aversion to Nuns, God and Religion. This echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize but does not know to whom.The director puts in all sorts of what-ifs and only-ifs.Nancy Cutter gets an offer to sleep at a friends house. She is holding a horse. Perry will comment on a picture of her and the house later on. Nancy can't sleep over at her friends' house because her boyfriend is coming over for dinner. The decision seals her fate.Perry talks of Bogart in \"Treasure of Sierra Madre\". But it is another Bogart picture, \"Beat the Devil\" which Truman Capote co-wrote, where a fictional treasure hunt is the McGuffin. But Dick knows that the protagonists of that film ended up with nothing. Dick wants the hard cash, the $10,000 he thinks is in the Clutter's safe, (which ironically turns out to be as much as a fantasy as Perry's Mexican Treasure.Cut to Herb Clutter signing a $40,000 life insurance policy. He's thinking about mortality at the moment. Ironically his mortality is about to end in a few hours. The insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes him a long life, again ironic when we know what will happen in a few hours.Dick has said that they wanted no witnesses so nobody would remember them.

It is just incredible how the homosexual relationships between author and protagonists are sublimated in the movie. The reporter is straight, the protagonists are more beatniks than gay.The film starts slowly, but on reviewing it a second time, we get all sorts of interesting information from similes that the writer/director Brooks creates.Notice the incredible cutting at the beginning where killers and to-be-killed are linked. Cutter on the phone is matched-cut to Perry on the phone. Cutter washing his face is matched-cut to Perry washing his face. Only Perry's looking in the mirror and seeing his eroticized male body sets off a fantasy of his playing a guitar in Las Vegas to empty chairs. This failure/fantasy matches the failure-fantasy that Perry tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in Alaska only to find it perpetually empty.Dick talks about shooting pheasants and the fact that the pheasants don't know that that they're going to die. we cut to the Clutters.Perry talks his dream about a yellow bird, \"Taller than Jesus\" who attacks the Nuns who have persecuted them. \"The Nuns begged for mercy,\" he tells us, \"But the bird slaughtered them anyway.\" The bird lifted Perry to paradise. Strangely, Perry says that he has an aversion to Nuns, God and Religion. This echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize but does not know to whom.The director puts in all sorts of what-ifs and only-ifs.Nancy Cutter gets an offer to sleep at a friends house. She is holding a horse. Perry will comment on a picture of her and the house later on. Nancy can't sleep over at her friends' house because her boyfriend is coming over for dinner. The decision seals her fate.Perry talks of Bogart in \"Treasure of Sierra Madre\". But it is another Bogart picture, \"Beat the Devil\" which Truman Capote co-wrote, where a fictional treasure hunt is the McGuffin. But Dick knows that the protagonists of that film ended up with nothing. Dick wants the hard cash, the $10,000 he thinks is in the Clutter's safe, (which ironically turns out to be as much as a fantasy as Perry's Mexican Treasure.Cut to Herb Clutter signing a $40,000 life insurance policy. He's thinking about mortality at the moment. Ironically his mortality is about to end in a few hours. The insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes him a long life, again ironic when we know what will happen in a few hours.Dick has said that they wanted no witnesses so nobody would remember them. Later, in fact, it is because they eliminated all the witnesses that they were remembered.\"There was one witness,\" the detective keeps telling Dick later. But was that witness the jail-house friend, Dick, Perry, Truman Capote, or God? The viewer becomes the witness after watching the movie.Fascinating film."}

{"original_text": "\"My Left Foot\" is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of Christy Brown, an artist who was crippled with cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot, the only limb in his body he had control over.

My problem with this film is that it is a bit too real at times. When Brown is in desperation and must help someone and do it all with his left foot, the film can be difficult to watch. This gives it an often depressing feel that may turn off some viewers for a time. However, if you look beyond that, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have handicaps and other difficulties to overcome.

The waiting room was small and cramped, with outdated toys and decorations that seemed more like an afterthought than a deliberate effort to create a fun and relaxed environment for young patients. Additionally, the staff seemed rushed and unfriendly, which only added to my discomfort. Despite these issues, I did appreciate the cleanliness and organization of the office, and the dentist and hygienist were both knowledgeable and professional.

{"original_text": "**A Cosmic Conundrum: \"Lifeforce\" Review** Tobe Hooper's 1985 sci-fi epic, \"Lifeforce\", is a mesmerizing, yet bewildering, cinematic experience that will leave you questioning the very fabric of reality. This visually stunning, yet narratively perplexing, film follows a team of space explorers who discover a mysterious, alien spacecraft containing a group of stunningly beautiful, yet deadly, vampires. The film's greatest strength lies in its groundbreaking visual effects, which hold up remarkably well even today. The depiction of the alien spacecraft and its inhabitants is both eerie and captivating, making for some truly unforgettable scenes. The performances, too, are commendable, particularly Mathilda May's captivating turn as the enigmatic, yet terrifying, Space Girl. However, it's the film's convoluted plot and pacing that may leave viewers scratching their heads. The story meanders, often feeling like a jumbled collection of disparate ideas and themes, rather than a cohesive narrative. The characters, too, are somewhat one-dimensional, making it difficult to become fully invested in their plight. Despite its flaws, \"Lifeforce\" remains a fascinating, if frustrating, film that will appeal to fans of sci-fi and horror.

But they were excellent in their roles and they went on to have Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is definitely worth a look."}

{"original_text": "I am reviewing the hotel and the conference/meeting rooms. First, the staff everywhere throughout this whole building is NICE NICE NICE. Everyone was beyond gracious and accommodating. I have zero complaints about the staff. They would obviously go out of their way to help anyone. Every bartender, every catering staffer, every hotel desk person, all of them, were SO customer-service oriented. Excellent all around in this area. The hotel rooms (standard room, paid $99 a night for a Fri. and Sat. in early August) look nice now because they are relatively new but I am not sure they will hold up over time. Very spacious for such a low price and the views are great. However, the room walls are paper-thin. I mean PAPER!! I heard everything (even the normal volume conversations -- in detail--- happening in the room next door). My neighbors also had a baby that cried for over 3 hours one day which made napping impossible. I have never heard so much through a hotel room wall before. This is a definite problem and I suspect they hear a lot about it from patrons. Another review mentioned that the room lighting is bad. This is true. It was nearly impossible to put on makeup even though they had a nice magnification mirror in the bathroom. I tried every spot and couldnt find a place with lighting. I ended up sitting by the window because it was still daylight and holding up my tiny compact on the couch. This is a small but highly frustrating thing for a woman. The shower and bathrooms are very nice in the rooms. High quality and the water was warm. I really liked the bathroom. So clean, too! The TVs are pretty neat because you can check-out on them. The free wi-fi was spotty and made me login again on their page over and over. The AV in the meeting rooms was cruddy. The mics went in and out and had a lot of interference. However the system is built-in rather than set up like most AV places, so I guess you get what you pay for. The art in all the conference rooms was gorgeous but it was so cold in all of them that I left my meeting to go defrost. I am not an \"always cold\" person -- lots of other people were frosty too. Conference room catering was good for the most part. Some things were high quality and delicious, others felt and tasted very mediocre chain-like. Hit and miss. The pool was always crowded with families. Not a relaxing environment at all. Spa service menu was very reasonably priced but not a lot of options. No deep tissue massage?! I would go back.

{"original_text": "Title: Zombie 3 (1988) Directors: Mostly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin Review: To review this flick and get some good background of it, I gotta start by the beginning. And the beginning of this is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn came out in 79, Lucio Fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it Zombie 2. That film is the one we know as plain ole Zombie. You know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark! OK so, after that flick (named Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and made a huge chunk of cash, the Italians decided, heck. Lets make some more zombie flicks! These things are raking in the dough! So Zombie 3 was born. Confused yet? The story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we've seen in a lot of American zombie flicks that we have seen before this one, the best comparison that comes to mind is Return of the Living Dead. Lets see...there's the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. Canister gets released into the general population and shebang! We get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh. A bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel. They gotta fight the zombies to survive.There was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie. First and foremost, Lucio Fulci the beloved godfather of gore from Italy was sick. So he couldn't really finish this film the way that he wanted to. The film was then handed down to two lesser directors Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good. You see Fulci himself didn't really have his heart and soul on this flick. He was disenchanted with it. He gave the flick over to the producers and basically said: \"Do whatever the hell you want with it!\" And god love them, they did.And that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great Fulci credited as its \"director\". The main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore! There's no substance to it whatsoever! After the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it, the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies. Now in some cases this can prove to be fun, if #1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and #2 there's a lot of gore and guts involved.Here we get neither! Well there's some inspired moments in there, like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people. That was cool. There's also a scene involving a flying zombie head (wich by the way defies all logic and explanation) and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs. But aside from that...the rest of the flick just falls flat on its ass.Endless upon endless scenes that don't do jack to move the already non existent plot along. That was my main gripe with this flick. The sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non-existent. I hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished! I like my b-movies, but this one just really went even below that! Its closer to a z-level flick, if you ask me.The zombie make up? Pure crap. The zombies are all Asian actors (the movie was filmed in the Philippines) so you get a bunch of Asian looking zombies. But thats not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway. Its the look of the zombies that really sucks! They all died with the same clothes on for some reason. And what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up (more like smudges) on their faces. One or two zombies had slightly more complex make up, but it still wasn't good enough to impress. Its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces. So not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap. These are supposed to be dead folks! Anyhows, for those expecting the usual coolness in a Fulci flick don't come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody else's flick. And those two involved (Mattei and Fragasso) didn't really put there heart and souls into it. In fact, when you see the extras on the DVD you will see that when Fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick, he doesn't even take it to seriously. You can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they \"just had a job to do and they did it\". And that my friends, is the last nail on this flick. There's no love, and no heart put into making this film. Therefore you get a half assed, crappy zombie flick.Only for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Title: Zombie 3 (1988) Directors: Mostly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin Review: To review this flick and get some good background of it, I gotta start by the beginning. And the beginning of this is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn came out in 79, Lucio Fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it Zombie 2. That film is the one we know as plain ole Zombie. You know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark! OK so, after that flick (named Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and made a huge chunk of cash, the Italians decided, heck. Lets make some more zombie flicks! These things are raking in the dough! So Zombie 3 was born. Confused yet? The story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we've seen in a lot of American zombie flicks that we have seen before this one, the best comparison that comes to mind is Return of the Living Dead. Lets see...there's the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. Canister gets released into the general population and shebang! We get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh. A bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel. They gotta fight the zombies to survive.There was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie. First and foremost, Lucio Fulci the beloved godfather of gore from Italy was sick. So he couldn't really finish this film the way that he wanted to. The film was then handed down to two lesser directors Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good. You see Fulci himself didn't really have his heart and soul on this flick. He was disenchanted with it. He gave the flick over to the producers and basically said: \"Do whatever the hell you want with it!\" And god love them, they did.And that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great Fulci credited as its \"director\". The main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore! There's no substance to it whatsoever! After the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it, the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies. Now in some cases this can prove to be fun, if #1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and #2 there's a lot of gore and guts involved.Here we get neither! Well there's some inspired moments in there, like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people. That was cool. There's also a scene involving a flying zombie head (wich by the way defies all logic and explanation) and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs. But aside from that...the rest of the flick just falls flat on its ass.Endless upon endless scenes that don't do jack to move the already non existent plot along. That was my main gripe with this flick. The sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non-existent. I hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished! I like my b-movies, but this one just really went even below that! Its closer to a z-level flick, if you ask me.The zombie make up? Pure crap.

{"original_text": "The vibe of this place is hip, urban and chill. Definitely a cool place to meet up with friends. It's very pricey but the foods are tasty, different and beautifully presented. My all time favorite dish so far has been the griddled mushrooms! These are so freaking delicious! If you love mushrooms, definitely try this! My friends and I ordered four servings ($8 per small plate) in one sitting. We'd share one small plate, then decide...just one more. There's a poached egg served on top. I recommend poking the egg and letting the yolk coat the mushrooms. Trust me. The mushrooms are cooked to perfection. There's just a bit of a crunch when you bite. Not too soft that can eat them without chewing. Honestly, these mushrooms taste like heaven in your mouth! I also liked the popcorn chicken ($9 for bowl of about 10-12). At first glance, these look like donut holes. But in a way, they also remind me of the chicken balls, you might find in a Chinese food buffet. The outside is crunchy and dusted with popcorn. The round ball of chicken inside is soft. At times, I found the section between the outer crunchy part and just around the chicken, a bit doughy. It would also be nice if there was some sort of sauce to dip these into, for extra flavor. My friends and I ordered a total of three bowls. I definitely recommend sharing. After eating three chicken balls, I personally had my fill. Another beautifully presented and tasty dish, is the crunch salad for $13. This dish looks like a tower of fancy shredded coleslaw. It's made with raw, pickled and fried veggies. When brought to your table, the servers pour the house made dressing, around and on top of this tower. All the while, you're thinking, WOW. Fancy! It's so pretty, you kind of feel bad tearing it down to eat it. Good thing it tastes as good as it looks! It tastes fresh and has just the right amount of dressing. We had two orders of this salad. Last but not least, we had the potato and squash gnocchi for $25. Ironically, the most expensive dish we ordered, was the biggest disappointment. I generally love eating duck. However, one taste of the gnocchi made me turned off by this dish. Hard to explain exactly why. My friend described it as \"too strong of a taste.\" You know how lamb has a distinct taste?

The weird thing was, my other friend, who is generally more picky with food, actually ate all the duck meat. He also said he also liked the taste of the broth.

{"original_text": "I'm not a follower of a certain movie genre. I classify movies only as industrial or non-industrial. Valentine is the second industrial movie of the director Jamie Blanks, after his Urban Legends. Unlike Urban Legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak. Yet again unlike Urban Legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic, and that is what makes Valentine the best. As the first basic and iconic element, the growing hatred of the serial killer is so down-to-earth. Since his secondary school years, he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends, who have made fun of him. When you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie, you will come to see this point of view of Humanism: \"Noone is entirely good or evil. In fact, somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted.\" Just because the story line and the direction is very weak, we are not as satisfied as we deserved. The second iconic element is, of course, the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s' super starlets: My favourite is Jessica Cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed. An arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in, while she was playing hide-and-seek with her blind date, never able to met with. Katherine Heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables. Denise Richards is killed third, while she just found a Valentines' Day gift for her at a whirlpool bath. Jessica Capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way, then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer. Marley Shelton is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know,'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed. Finally, Benita Ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer, David Boreanaz.The third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene, the Valentines' Day celebration at Dorothy's house scenes and ultimately the killing themes. Everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as I know.

Unlike Urban Legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak. Yet again unlike Urban Legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic, and that is what makes Valentine the best. As the first basic and iconic element, the growing hatred of the serial killer is so down-to-earth. Since his secondary school years, he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends, who have made fun of him. When you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie, you will come to see this point of view of Humanism: \"Noone is entirely good or evil. In fact, somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted.\" Just because the story line and the direction is very weak, we are not as satisfied as we deserved. The second iconic element is, of course, the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s' super starlets: My favourite is Jessica Cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed. An arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in, while she was playing hide-and-seek with her blind date, never able to met with. Katherine Heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables. Denise Richards is killed third, while she just found a Valentines' Day gift for her at a whirlpool bath. Jessica Capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way, then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer. Marley Shelton is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know,'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed. Finally, Benita Ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer, David Boreanaz.The third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene, the Valentines' Day celebration at Dorothy's house scenes and ultimately the killing themes. Everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as I know. Hard Rock never suits better within a serial killer-mystery movie."}

{"original_text": "**A Masterclass in Atmosphere and Psychological Horror** \"Eyes Without a Face\" is a hauntingly beautiful film that will leave you unsettled and disturbed long after the credits roll. Georges Franju's 1962 masterpiece is a work of cinematic art that weaves together a complex web of themes, motifs, and imagery to create a deeply unsettling and thought-provoking experience. The film's atmosphere is its greatest strength, with Franju using a combination of eerie settings, unsettling sound design, and a haunting score to create a sense of unease and tension that permeates every scene. The cinematography is equally impressive, with Franju using long takes and deliberate pacing to build a sense of unease and anticipation. But what truly sets \"Eyes Without a Face\" apart is its exploration of themes and ideas. The film is a powerful commentary on the dangers of playing God, the consequences of scientific hubris, and the devastating effects of trauma and loss. The performances are also noteworthy, with Pierre Brasseur and Alida Valli delivering standout performances.

{"original_text": "**A Bloody Good Sequel: \"Halloween II\" Review** Rob Zombie's \"Halloween II\" is a masterclass in horror storytelling, expertly weaving together the threads of the original while introducing a new level of intensity and terror. The film picks up where its predecessor left off, with Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) still reeling from her encounter with Michael Myers (Tyler Mane). As the anniversary of the murders approaches, Laurie begins to experience strange and terrifying visions, hinting at a deeper connection between herself and the masked killer. Zombie's direction is a highlight, as he crafts a sense of unease and dread that permeates every frame. The score is equally effective, pulsing with a primal energy that amplifies the on-screen tension. The cast delivers solid performances, with Taylor-Compton shining as the beleaguered Laurie. But it's Mane's Michael Myers that steals the show, his imposing presence and eerie silence making him a force to be reckoned with. While some may find the pacing a tad slow, \"Halloween II\" is a slow-burning build-up to a thrilling climax that will leave fans of the franchise breathless.

{"original_text": "I rented this film from Netflix for two reasons - I was in the mood for what I thought would be a silly'50s sci-fi-asco and because it is the first feature-length Superman film. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes I found myself thoroughly engaged and very pleasantly surprised.An experimental oil well has penetrated about six miles into the earth and is being shut down by the sponsor. Lois and Clark show up to get the scoop but are disappointed that the deepest well ever drilled will no longer be in operation. A day later, strange events at the well make for a story more appropriate for Superman than Clark Kent. It seems that the radioactive Mole Men have invaded from their six-mile deep home near the earth's core.Supermen and the Mole Men is a simplistic but well-made piece of social realism. Released in 1951, starring a lead actor who served in World War II, the moral of the story seems to be that Americans are just as capable of becoming fascists as anybody else. To drive this point home in a typically straightforward Superman manner, Reeves even accuses the lynch mob hunting the Mole Men of being'Nazis' at one point.Even in the 1950s, the science underlying this film was nonexistent. Six miles of drilling through continental crust would not have even penetrated the upper mantle, let alone the \"hollow center of the earth\" - which, in any case does not exist. Forgivable - keep in mind that this film is based on a golden age comic book.The film is a little unevenly paced. Although the Molemen are interesting, a bit creepy, and nicely portrayed, there are several Corman-esquire scenes which spend too much time redundantly showing us their odd behavior. The script is intelligent and economical. By today's standards, the costuming is poor to fair, but for its time, this film's special effects and costuming were quite good.

If you like regular nachos, the kind with real melted cheese (not fake cheese sauce), these are some of the best you can get. They're nothing crazy, no unique twist, just damn good nachos. If you want fancier nachos, try elsewhere. But here is going to be one of your best options for straight up regular delicious nachos. The half portion is more than sufficient for one person. I cannot even imagine trying to tackle the full portion. I'm a vegetarian so I never get it with beef, but you can totally add a meat option should you wish. Also delicious is their mac and cheese. It's so cheesy, never dried out, and always has some nice cheese melted right on top. You can get it as a side with many of their burgers, or you can order the entr\u00e9e sized. And in my opinion, you can never go wrong by adding green chiles to the mac and cheese. Because green chilis are a gift. I love their caprese appetizer as well. Standard mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic. But it's always tasty. Same with the mozzarella sticks. Their white bean hummus plate is also delicious. The other thing I love about trident is they do what, in my opinion, all restaurants with burgers should do, they say at the top you can take any burger and substitute a veggie patty. It's baffling to me how many places don't even offer a veggie burger at all (they're frozen! not that hard to keep them stocked!) or if they do, they're hesitant or unwilling to accommodate a request to add it to a different burger than the one veggie burger listed on the menu. Why in the world, if you already have veggie patties on hand, do I have to order the ONE veggie burger you have listed? Why can't I just substitute the veggie patty onto any other option? It drives me bonkers. But for Trident, this is never the case! The mushroom swiss looks good to you? They'll make it with a veggie patty. The green chile burger looks great? They'll make it a veggie. Etc., etc., etc. It's a standard Boca Burger, which are ok. Normally I avoid Boca Burgers, but Trident makes me excited to eat a veggie burger! I recommend the Green Chile with a Boca Burger, and add a fried egg. Side salad and no bun if you want low carb. Or, if you're indulging, side of mac & cheese. For non-vegetarians, my friends are always happy to eat here too. Popular choices among my friends include the grilled shrimp skewers, the non-veggie burgers, the crispy shrimp po-boy, and the paleo bowl. They also have a fully stocked bar.

Based on the best-selling book by James Redfield, first (self) published in 1993, this cornucopia of kitsch tracks the spiritual awakening of an American history teacher (Matthew Settle) who, on traveling to deepest, darkest, phoniest Peru and sniffing either the air or something else more illegal. Namely what he discovers is a schlock Shangri La populated by smiling zombies who may be nuts or just heavily medicated, perhaps because they're often accompanied by a panpipe flourish and an occasional shout out from a celestial choir. Although there's a lot of talk about \"energy,\" that quality is decidedly missing from the motley cast whose numbers include Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, all of whom are now firmly ensconced in the camp pantheon. For those who care, the plot involves the military, terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni provided the inept direction while Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the hoot of a script.

{"original_text": "If the name of my restaurant was my last name I'd make dam sure it was good! Well Charles LaScala shouldn't worry because this is a very good mid-level Italian restaurant. I've been to dinner, lunch, and happy hour here all multiple times so I know my way around this place. Before I discuss the many great things about this establishment I'll mention two issues that are less than good. First this place has an active bar with multiple TVs. This is great for Happy Hour but not so great if you are seated near it with the intention of having a peaceful meal. So Rule #1 is to ask to be seated away from the bar. I've never found this to be a problem as the staff is very accommodating. Second, in my opinion, the adult libations are generally a dollar or two too high for a mid-level Italian place. It's very easy to order drinks here that go over $10. So consider yourself forewarned. So let's talk about all the positive attributes- The location is fabulous. It's within walking distance of Olde City, the Walnut Street Theater, the Historic District, etc., etc. The have a few outside tables and Chestnut Street is great for people watching. These folks have one of the best free parking arrangements in all of Philadelphia. That's right, I said free and the parking lot is in the same building. If you are driving in it doesn't get any better than this. Note that free parking is available after 3 PM. They use OpenTable so making your reservation is super convenient. By the way, these folks do a great job during Restaurant Weeks. Make yourself a note to book early for those coveted RW seatings. Regarding the food; expect classic Italian in large portions. It doesn't matter if you are a carnivore, like your protein from the sea, or are of the vegetarian persuasion. Everybody will be happy here. Expect appetizers to be about $10 and entr\u00e9es to range from the high teens to mid-twenties. The Broccoli Rabe appetizer ($10) is to die for. It comes with sweet Italian sausage and grilled polenta. The lovely wife has tried the Chicken Alla Roma ($21) and pronounced it excellent. It comes with mushrooms and asparagus in a lemon-caper sauce. If you are in this part of town, give them a try for lunch.

{"original_text": "**A Hilarious and Heartwarming Underdog Story** \"Revenge of the Nerds\" is a comedy classic that has stood the test of time. Released in 1984, the film tells the story of Lewis Skolnick (Robert Carradine), a socially awkward high school student who, along with his nerdy friends, seeks revenge against the popular jocks who have tormented them for years. The film's humor is clever and witty, with a perfect balance of slapstick comedy and clever one-liners. The cast of characters is lovable and relatable, with each nerd bringing their own unique quirks and strengths to the table. The chemistry between the actors is undeniable, making it easy to become invested in their misadventures. The film's message about the importance of embracing one's individuality and not judging others based on their appearance is timely and timeless. The film's nostalgic value is also a major draw, with its 80s setting and soundtrack perfectly capturing the era's spirit. The special effects may be dated, but the film's charm lies in its heart and humor, making it a must-see for anyone who loves a good underdog story.

{"original_text": "Released as Zentropa in North America to avoid confusion with Agniezska Holland's own Holocaust film Europa Europa, this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise, inspire or downright shock is a bizarre, nostalgic, elaborate film about a naive American in Germany shortly following the end of WWII. The American, named Leo, doesn't fully get what he's doing there. He has come to take part in fixing up the country since, in his mind, it's about time Germany was shown some charity. No matter how that sounds, he is not a Nazi sympathizer or so much as especially pro-German, merely mixed up. His uncle, who works on the railroad, gets Leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car, and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 Germany's horrors and enigmas.This progression starts when Leo, played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor Jean-Marc Barr, meets a sultry heiress on the train played by Barbara Sukowa, an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor. She seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family, which owns the company which manufactures the trains. These were the precise trains that took Jews to their deaths during the war, but now they run a drab day-to-day timetable, and the woman's Uncle Kessler postures as another one of those good Germans who were just doing their jobs. There is also Udo Kier, the tremendous actor who blew me away in Von Trier's shocking second film Epidemic, though here he is mere scenery.Another guest at the house is Eddie Constantine, an actor with a quiet strength, playing a somber American intelligence man. He can confirm that Uncle Kessler was a war criminal, though it is all completely baffling to Leo. Americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades, but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than Leo, who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death train.The story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film's Danish director, Lars Von Trier, whose anchor is in the film's breathtaking editing and cinematography. He shoots in black and white and color, he uses double-exposures, optical effects and trick photography, having actors interact with rear-projected footage, he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects, caught between glass for our more precise survey.This Grand Jury Prize-winning surrealist work is allegorical, but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer. I interpret it as a film about the last legs of Nazism, symbolized by the train, and the ethical accountability of Americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads. During the time frame of the movie, and the Nazi state, and such significance to the train, are dead, but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexes.The characters, music, dialogue, and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions. The most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones. Two trains halting back and forth, Barr on one and Sukowa on another. An underwater shot of proliferating blood. An uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown. And most metaphysically affecting of all, an anesthetic shot of train tracks, as Max von Sydow's voice allures us to hark back to Europe with him, and abandon our personal restraint.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Released as Zentropa in North America to avoid confusion with Agniezska Holland's own Holocaust film Europa Europa, this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise, inspire or downright shock is a bizarre, nostalgic, elaborate film about a naive American in Germany shortly following the end of WWII.

The brightness and contrast are a bit too high, so a lot of the scenes seem bleached out especially when Vera is dancing in a white dress.

{"original_text": "**A Revolutionary Portrait of Youthful Rebellion** Jean-Luc Godard's \"Masculin f\u00e9minin\" (1966) is a groundbreaking cinematic experiment that challenges traditional notions of narrative, character, and identity. This influential film is a poetic and provocative exploration of the tumultuous relationships between young people in post-'68 Paris, as they navigate the blurred lines between masculinity and femininity, reality and fiction. Godard's innovative use of non-professional actors, improvisation, and fragmented storytelling creates a sense of immediacy and urgency, capturing the restless energy and intellectual curiosity of the era. The film's central characters, a group of young friends, are portrayed with a mix of tenderness and detachment, their emotions and desires laid bare in a series of intimate, often surreal encounters. Through its bold, unconventional style, \"Masculin f\u00e9minin\" not only reflects the radical changes sweeping through French society but also anticipates the fragmented, postmodern world that would soon follow. This film is a testament to Godard's visionary filmmaking and his ability to capture the essence of a generation's rebellious spirit.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Jean-Luc Godard's \"Masculin f\u00e9minin\" will be shown at the Film Society of Lincoln Center's (FSC) 50th anniversary celebration on Thursday, 5 December, at 7pm., and on Friday, 5 January, at 2pm, at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, and at the BFI London Film Festival in March 2018., and will be available on demand on the film society's website."}

{"original_text": "After hearing the word of mouth of just how bad this film is I took the plunge and bought the DVD. That said everything previously mentioned about this film is true. For a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all. The list of problems with the film could drag on forever. Chief amongst them is the film is simply too long. It dragged on for a few minutes short of 3 hours. Nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly. Secondly, as many had pointed out from the \"trailers\", the special effects are anything but special. The tripods looked OK in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was grade-Z 1970's or 1980's quality. Probably the worst effects of all were the horses, which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved. The heat ray effects were laughable, as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles. Also pitiful was the Thunderchild sequence, in which the Thunderchild, described in the book as an ironclad ram, looked nothing of the sort. Instead it resembled a World War 1 era destroyer, complete with deck guns (which fired but had no visible crew), and torpedo tubes. The colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects. Most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out Mars to her in the sky. Well, the sky is black, but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight. There is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape, bathed in full sunlight, and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars. To detract even further, the color of the scenes made no sense. In some they are bathed in orange light. In others green light. In still others it's blue light. In some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue. The frame-rate and camera is very shaky, giving everything a stuttering look.Finally, the acting is overall sub-par. One man portrays two characters who's sole difference was one lacked a mustache. This led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were. The English accents, even to American ears, are outrageous. In summary, this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times. I have not seen Gigli or some of the other recent flops but this one, because of it's poor quality in every respect, must easily be worse then anything that mainstream Hollywood has put out. I would not be surprised if the movie makes it to the bottom 10 or 20 in the IMDb rankings.

Son wants out of the business, father won't let him. Macy loves his own son, played beautifully by David Dorfman (\"The Ring\"). He also starts to fall in love with Neve Campbell, a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist's office.It's an interesting juxtaposition of characters and the film follows the reluctant killer as he balances his own needs with those of his family. There are many touching scenes, especially between Macy and his little boy.

Particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the \"routines\" of the hospital crew (despite the signs of occasional empathy).

Clint Eastwood returns as the grizzled and unyielding Inspector Harry Callahan, who finds himself entangled in a web of intrigue and murder when a group of aspiring rock stars begin to die off one by one. The film's central mystery is engaging and well-crafted, with a clever twist that adds depth to the story. Eastwood's performance is, as always, top-notch, bringing a sense of gravitas and authority to the role of Harry Callahan.

The film's pacing is well-balanced, blending moments of humor and tension with intense action sequences. The film's climax is particularly memorable, featuring a thrilling showdown between Harry and the villainous killer. The film's themes of mortality and the fleeting nature of fame are also thought-provoking, adding a layer of depth to the proceedings.

The film's eerie atmosphere and sense of dread lingered long after the credits rolled, making it difficult for me to relax. Bergman's use of long takes, stark black-and-white cinematography, and the performances of Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann only added to the sense of unease and tension.

The film's exploration of the blurred lines between reality and fantasy, and the fragility of the human psyche, left me feeling unsettled and disturbed. It's a film that demands attention and reflection, but it's also one that's difficult to process and digest. As I sit here trying to process the experience, I'm left with more questions than answers.

Instead, it feels like a shallow and overly dramatic retelling of a complex and important story."}

Nevertheless, if you are absorbed in the film like me, you will find this not a problem at all.I must say this is the best comedy I have ever seen. \"Shall We Dansu?\" is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. It is very different from Hollywood ones, e.g. Austin Powers or Scary Movies, in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes. Rather, it is light-hearted, a movie that makes you feel good.I love the movie because it makes me feel \"real\". The plot is straightforward yet pleasing. I was so delighted seeing that Sugiyama (the main role) has found the meaning of life in dancing. Before I watched the film I was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork. I felt lost. However, this film made me think of the bright side of life. I believed I was in the same boat of Sugiyama; if he could find himself in his hobby, why couldn't I? It reminded me of \"exploring my own future\" and discovering the happiness in my daily life.It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers. While some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect, I kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really \"alive\", learning to dance as the film goes on.Over all, this film is encouraging and heart-warming.

{"original_text": "There were a lot of things going against this movie for me before I watched it.First, I was a typical high school senior, in a Shakespeare class I didn't really even like, much less understood half of! Shakespeare would be no more than UNINTELLIGIBLE without me pouring ALL my concentration into his almost encrypted plays.... encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language..... and then I still wouldn't get most of it.Second, it was 4 hours long! I never thought that could be a good thing.Well let me tell you something. This movie was so masterful, so beautiful, I actually understood all the language as it was being performed. Now, the script was followed to the letter in this movie, the same script that was incomprehensible to me in Shakespeare class. And here I was my mind opening and me understanding it. I was doubting myself while watching the movie almost! But lo and behold.... when performed, and only then, Shakespeare comes to life. So this version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare is indeed a master, who wrote great stories. When I saw it on the big screen, especially in the high budget major motion picture style (with beautiful cinematography and photography), and acted amazingly by Brannagh and cast, somehow..... I understood what was going on. What was being said. The language is awesome and passionate. It allows for more raw emotion.... when words can't describe something, maybe Shakespeare's words can.I still hold to this day that Fist of The North Star (animated, english dub) is the greatest movie ever made. No movie provides more sheer entertainment. But for a movie to come close to dethroning Fist from that position (which Hamlet did -- it came close) is truly amazing..... awe inspiring. It wasn't a movie. It was an event.Even more amazing, it made me appreciate shakespeare. Wow. Powerful. Powerful is the word. One of the rare, TRULY powerful movies out there.This gets 2 hundred trillion stars out of infinity stars. Yes yes.By the way, all you kids out there in a Shakespeare class.... forget it.

It was phenomenal. I asked for both sauces (thai curry / raspberry sauce) on the side - I definitely prefer the thai curry sauce while my mom mixed both sauces together. The duck was seriously cooked to perfection. We also had the shrimp pad thai - it was okay - it wasn't great but it wasn't bad. It's pad thai - I think the $18 price is a bit much for pad thai.

{"original_text": "LL Cool J performed much better in this movie that I expected! He did a fabulous job acting as a \"renegade\" cop within a \"renegade\" department. From the very beginning, he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he's in. He acts as a sort of \"gentle giant\" -- a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody, yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start -- and he does an amazing job. He was quite clearly the best character in the movie.This was certainly a performance that will not win Morgan Freeman any awards. After starring in powerhouse films like the Shawshank Redemption this film was certainly a step down. His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor -- and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner. There are so many ways his character (Moses Ashford) could have taken a more pivotal role. That he didn't was disappointing and a true let-down. I was hoping to see more from him in this film.Timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry. His portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive. This movie is a typical action movie that (at least initially) bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs LA has experienced in the past. Being an action movie, it has its share of shoot-em-up scenes, blood, and guts. These scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable. Watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end -- think of what you would typically expect in a good-cops/bad-cops conflict -- and it bears little resemblance to a REAL police shoot-out.What irked me most was the way Timberlake's character behaved during shoot-out scenes. He starts out having guns and not using them. Then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he's been firing a gun his whole life. Then he runs out of bullets and doesn't have a gun -- and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything -- suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns AND extra ammo?! Little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me.If what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay, then you'll probably love this movie. Personally, it doesn't matter to me what KIND of movie it is as long as it is realistic. Make me believe that the story is true.

{"original_text": "**A Delightful Holiday Classic** I just had the pleasure of re-watching \"The Shop Around the Corner\" (1940) and I'm still grinning from ear to ear. This charming romantic comedy, directed by Ernst Lubitsch, is a masterclass in wit, charm, and old-fashioned storytelling. The film tells the tale of two co-workers, Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) and Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan), who unknowingly fall in love through anonymous letters exchanged at a Budapest holiday shop. As they navigate their blossoming romance, they must also contend with their gruff and eccentric boss, Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan). The chemistry between Stewart and Sullavan is undeniable, and their characters' banter is some of the most delightful and clever I've ever seen on screen. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with memorable turns from Joseph Schildkraut and William Demarest. The film's themes of love, friendship, and the power of human connection are timeless and universal, making it a holiday classic that continues to enchant audiences to this day.

She's pretty picky about it of course, she's been used to the main 3 places up there that do it a little differently. Of course I was excited anyways because I'd never had Chicago style pizza before. After all the worriedness that she had, she was extremely happy with both the pizza and the awesome vintagey atmosphere. The waitress was very friendly as well. The self-serve beer cooler had a pretty good selection of craft beer, though I would have loved to see more of my favorites there. Also, the greek salad was easily one of the best I'd ever had in my entire life. It was pretty epic.

I needed it done in a rush and they were able to accommodate me. Given the tight turnaround, and the work that needed to be done, I didn't mind paying a premium. The service and results far exceeded my expectations. Complete Experience: I was attending a convention in Nashville, TN and had ordered an evening gown online a week before (admitted procrastinator tendencies). The gown was a navy blue Tadashi Shoji evening gown with sequins and an intricately designed lace and sheer layered bodice. The gown was a tad bit too long and there was a bulge in the back. The dress arrived a few days before I was scheduled to fly out to Nashville and I knew I wouldn't have time to get it tailored before leaving. I found a few Nashville area tailor shops on Yelp, read the reviews and decided I might try Stitch-It. I also saw a few cleaners that advertised they performed tailoring services, but they (quite frankly) didn't give me the warm and fuzzies. Stitch-It was about a 30 minute drive from the Gaylord Hotel where I was staying, so before taking a taxi that far, I decided to check with the hotel to see if they had an in-house tailor. When I took the dress to the Gaylord tailor/seamstress (who was the nicest lady ever), she looked at the gown and said \"I can hem the bottom....I'd have to do it by hand. The top part though....I won't touch that with a 10ft. pole!\" I laughed, but appreciated her honesty in not being able to handle the work that I needed done. I contacted Stitch-It and sent pictures of the dress via text message to a nice young man who's name I can't remember (I think it was Cameron...I could be wrong). They assured me that they should be able to accommodate me, so I hopped a cab and visited Stitch-It. When I arrived I was greeted by courteous and professional staff. I was shown to the dressing room and changed into my gown. My personal tailor was Maggie O'Neill and she was AWESOME! After the fitting and pinning, I left the gown and picked it up in two days.

He puts on the gladiator's helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers.This thing is just so utterly senseless it's maddening. Here's a short list of things that don't make any sense:1) A guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside. The guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside. Then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent - arriving the next morning?!? He was only 50 feet away!2) These two dunderheads then hear another girl scream (What, 100 feet away?), but don't investigate because they're afraid they'll get lost.3) Another guy and a girl are walking around, and in about their 10th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances, protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor. I mean, what the...? First off, that's just a really stupid thing to say, secondly he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together.4) A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and he stops her, telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing. Um, yeah, we kinda noticed she's wounded and not dead because she's up and walking around. But, thanks for that tidbit of information.5) One girl is tied up in Demonicus' lair, and when someone attempts to free her, she instead instructs this person to go and get help. Um, look, idiot, if she set you free, which would take about 5 seconds, there would be no need to get help.And it just goes on and on. The whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods, then they fight, then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends, then they wander around some more. It's just so damned boring and pointless that I turned the DVD off halfway through. None of these characters are sympathetic, especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time. Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him - he looks like a kid in a Halloween costume, scrunching his face up to look evil. He runs, or should I say scampers around like he's gay. The special effects are comedic, the acting is for the most part awful, and nothing makes any sense.Overall, maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it, getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue, creating characters with actual likable personalities, having some sort of logical flow to the action, and maybe even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit.

{"original_text": "**A Timeless Tale of Friendship and Self-Discovery** \"The Big Chill\" is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving together a complex tapestry of relationships, nostalgia, and introspection. The film's ensemble cast, featuring Tom Berenger, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, Kevin Kline, William Hurt, Meg Tilly, and Mary Kay Place, deliver performances that are both authentic and captivating. The story follows a group of former college friends who reunite for a weekend at a large country house, where they confront the realities of their lives, relationships, and mortality. Director Lawrence Kasdan's thoughtful pacing and clever script allow the characters to breathe, and the film's themes of love, loss, and the search for meaning are both poignant and relatable. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the beauty of the countryside and the warmth of the characters' interactions. The film's score, featuring a memorable soundtrack of 1960s classics, perfectly complements the on-screen action. Overall, \"The Big Chill\" is a cinematic treasure that continues to resonate with audiences today.

If you love south park you'll love this! Maybe don't watch with kids it is bit inappropriate for little dudes. some duds give it 6 1/2 out of ten, I give it 11 out of ten."}

We started with the famous guacamole, which was creamy and fresh, and the tortilla chips were crispy and addictive. For our main courses, I opted for the carne asada tacos, which were tender and flavorful, and my companion chose the chicken fajitas, which were cooked to perfection. But the real showstopper was the dessert menu, which featured an array of sweet treats that would satisfy any sweet tooth. We shared the churros, which were crispy and sugary, and the tres leches cake, which was moist and decadent. The service was attentive and friendly, and the prices were very reasonable.

From the moment I stepped inside, I was enveloped in the cozy atmosphere and tantalizing aromas of freshly baked bagels and expertly brewed coffee. The staff is warm and welcoming, making you feel like you're sipping coffee with old friends. The bagels are a game-changer - crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and perfectly toasted. I've tried several flavors, but the cinnamon raisin is my weakness. And don't even get me started on the coffee... rich, smooth, and expertly crafted. I've never had a bad cup here! But what really sets Treme apart is the attention to detail. From the carefully curated playlist to the adorable decor, every aspect of this coffeehouse is thoughtfully designed to make you feel at home.

They have different trip options with varying lengths at affordable prices and the nice thing is they have an army of'dudes' to haul the canoe in and out of the river for you. They provide life jackets but no instruction on how to canoe, although we didn't ask. Honestly though, it is self explanatory and really you don't learn how to do it until you are actually in the boat experimenting anyway. I highly recommend bringing lunch, hat and water. I don't recommend swimming because the Harpeth runs up against lots of farm land, which means lots of run off, which means lots of pollution. It's very very pretty, if not a little trashed - we saw a bunch of tires and bud light beer cans. It's mostly quiet and in some places all you can hear is the breeze and water.

Probably one of the better entries in the film, it's easily the creepiest. The atmosphere here is what sets it apart. The scenes with the fictional character are genuinely creepy, the mystery surrounding him is really effective and there's always a classic creep-out moment. The classic moment is the kill in the psychiatrist's office, which is an all-time high for creepiness.

Ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from Jane's past, which John vehemently denies. When she learns the true nature of what has happened, it's far more shocking that what she could've thought possible. With the creepiest outright plot and the biggest twist of the stories, this is a quite pleasant entry. The mystery of the family is wonderfully played out, with small amounts of clues piled up here and there, and the final revelation is downright nerve-wracking.

There's a clever premise here, and it does provide an excuse to spend time in a wax museum, which are always creepy. This is no exception, and it looks eerie, which is helped by the florescent lighting on display on the sculptures. A dream sequence provides a great moment of suspense, but what ultimately kills this one is the slow pace. It takes a long time for events to unfold out, and most of the time is spent on exposition. It also builds up to a shock ending that can be seen coming from a mile away. Those really lower this one a bit.

Unconvinced the cloak is the cause, he does everything he can to prove it's just in his imagination. This has a pretty decent premise, and there is plenty of opportunity for some decent scares, but what sinks it is several factors. First, it's just too goofy for it's own good. The plot twist at the end is a perfect example, which is so overdone that it's not really a shock at all, and just comes across as just plain silly.

Tom Skerritt is the Rev.

Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years.What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands.

{"original_text": "There was a great film to be made about Steve Biko. Sadly this wasn't it. Denzel Washington - never the most flexible of actors - is totally unable to convey the great charisma that Biko had. Attenborough's big crowd scenes are laughable. The Soweto massacre wasn't like this, three neat lines of children (some doing cartwheels!) marching happily into the guns of the soldiers. With Biko dead the film rapidly descends into farce. If the struggle against Apartheid was anything it was a black people's struggle yet somehow we are all supposed to be gripped by the escape of a white man and his family.

Sadly this wasn't it. Denzel Washington - never the most flexible of actors - is totally unable to convey the great charisma that Biko had. Attenborough's big crowd scenes are laughable. The Soweto massacre wasn't like this, three neat lines of children (some doing cartwheels!) marching happily into the guns of the soldiers. With Biko dead the film rapidly descends into farce. If the struggle against Apartheid was anything it was a black people's struggle yet somehow we are all supposed to be gripped by the escape of a white man and his family.

Yes, even they got their hands into low exploitation sickies like this, and Bamboo is definitely among the worse attempts of the whole genre, even when compared to the Western attempts that usually pale in comparison with the Eastern films!The story is about a Japanese war camp in which the Chinese women are brutalized, abused and raped by the bad Japanese (what else?) during the World War II. The girls also know a secret place in which a box full of gold is hidden and also learn that a Chinese military officer raised in Japan (Shaw veteran Lo Lieh) is actually now an undercover agent among the other Japanese and naturally helps the girls escape the hell. What follows is sequences full of gratuitous nudity, female kung fu, some nasty torture, gore, sleaze and extremely offensive anti Japan attitude that make this film pure and honest garbage that doesn't even try to be more than it is.There are hardly any interesting elements in Bamboo House of Dolls. The occasional photography especially at the end looks nice with its sunbeams and beautiful nature but that's about it in the merits department. The fight scenes are plenty and always include half naked females hitting and kicking each other. The violence overall is quite nasty at times with several bullet wounds, misogynistic torture scenes (for example, one poor girl is brutalized on the floor filled with broken glass etc.) and extremely repulsive ending and moral behind it. Of course it is stupid to talk about \"moral\" when writing about this kind of film, but still there are elements I won't accept to be found from any film.The film has also some enjoyable turkey elements for sure! For example, the gold box, filled with heavy gold, seems suspiciouly light as the weak and suffered girls don't seem to have any problems lifting and moving it, not to speak of throwing it! Also those numerous \"skin fight scenes\" make this quite smile inducing for fans of trash cinema. I have seen the same director's Killer Snakes (1973) which is ten times more noteworthy as a piece and even though it has many alive snakes killed for real, it is also visually more interesting and shows us some nasty sides of the other side of the big city and society.

Even if it's not a comfortable watch, it's a powerful and thought-provoking one."}

{"original_text": "Many of the classic films of the late'60s haven't retained their ability to disturb and confront the audience. \"In Cold Blood\" hasn't lost an ounce of its power. Its exceptionally well made yet forces the viewer to think. Some have complained not only about the film, but about Truman Capote's source \"non-fiction novel\", that the central message is unsubtle. That may be true, but this is definitely a case where the lack of ambiguity doesn't detract from the film at all. Its refreshing, especially considering today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas, to see a film with a convinced political voice unafraid to force the audience to consider its viewpoint. To be honest, I'm not sure if I agree with the film's central message, but I admire its audacity nonetheless.Even if you disagree with the anti-capital punishment message, there's plenty to admire about the film. The acting from the two leads is terrific. Scott Wilson (still one of the most underrated actors ever) is chilling as the nihilistic leader, one who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake is also chilling as the more submissive of the two and the one with a conscience. His character obviously has a voice of reason, but is terrified to go against Wilson (theres a good amount of homoerotic subtext on his character's part). The cinematography is terrific, sleek yet gritty and really giving the impression the viewer is watching a documentary.

I figured I had to try it. The restaurant itself is the size of a postage stamp, with maybe 10 tables. You're not getting in without reservations, so if you're interested in eating here, make sure you call ahead. Would I call this one of the best Italian restaurants in the country? Frankly, no. That doesn't mean it's not good. But dining out is about more than just the food, and this is the area I feel is lacking. I'm not talking about the servers, who were friendly and knowledgeable. Due to the size restrictions and the fact that the restaurant is almost completely wood-furnished, the noise level is INSANE. I know they are going for that Sicilian trattoria feel, but some noise-cancelling measures like curtains or plants could have been helpful. It was almost impossible to carry a conversation with my dining companions without screaming. The food: the menu is set up for a traditional Italian three-course meal of salad, pasta, and entree. My friend and I started with the antipasto for two and the panzanella (bread) salad. The bread salad -- topped with capers, white anchovies, and wonderful (if out-of-season) tomatoes -- was a winner. The antipasto was a mixed bag. Some items (the charred broccoli, house-cured beets, and tuna with white beans) were amazing. Others (the carrots, cauliflower, potatoes, and cheeses) were surprisingly bland. For my pasta course, I had the housemade tagliatelli with lemon sauce, topped with bottarga (tuna roe). The pasta was well made (perfect consistency), the sauce was decent (it had a nice spice, but the lemon was a little overwhelming -- and I say that as someone who loves citrus). I am not sure that the saltiness of the bottarga was the perfect complement to this dish, either. I had the rabbit for my entree. It was excellent: fall-off-the-bone tender and served in a great sauce. I was a bit disappointed, though, that it was served with just a few unremarkable potatoes as the garnish. The server had mentioned that the dishes were \"protein-heavy,\" but even so, I wanted something a little more exciting on the side.

{"original_text": "This movie is rated a classic on sentiment not on any quality of movie-making. It moves from the unlikely to the unbelievable, from the unrealistic to the ludicrous.The unbelievable plot revolves around an attempt by two British soldiers and a Hindu gofer to rescue a third soldier who has been captured by insurgent Indians. In the later scene we see a full regiment with drum and bagpipes marching into an ambush. In the British army, a sergeant does not order up a rescue attempt, and if you get past that, he does not attempt it with only one other soldier and an Indian servant when there is a full regiment on hand. The Indian insurgents are so incredibly inept it is laughable...there are hundreds of them but they can't hold their prisoner or kill the two rescuers, of course not. At one point we see the British soldiers throwing blocks of stone down from the battlements at the insurgents, who are scattered around the mountainside in ambush...one would have to have an eggplant for a brain to think this would do any damage. After Cary Grant as the rescued prisoner is shot, he lies on the floor looking around at the water boy...hardly the actions of someone who has been shot in the back. The water boy bravely blows a bugle (which comes from nowhere) to sound the alarm...this he does by standing up high on a wall so he can be seen and shot by the bad guys, and we shed a tear as he keeps trying to sound more notes as he is repeatedly shot and the bugle call breaks up into feeble squawks...instead of blowing the bugle while hiding behind cover as anybody with half a brain would do. This scene has deservedly been parodied in comedy sketches. If they wanted to make a Buster Keaton comedy, they should have hired Keaton and done it better.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This movie is rated a classic on sentiment not on any quality of movie-making.

{"original_text": "There's really no way to beat around the bush in saying this, Lady Death: The Motion Picture just plain sucks. Aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence, the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980's cartoon based on a line of action figures. The bad guy himself even talks like a Skeletor wannabe, has the obligatory inept henchman, and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon. Just don't expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue. At other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai, yet there is no sex, no tentacle rape (Thank goodness!) and very little sex appeal, this despite the physical appearance of the title character.

{"original_text": "This is possibly the worst film I've ever seen. The fact that it has a flimsy storyline is bad enough, that they've hooked it around the subject of football violence makes it 100 times worse.I had severe doubts about the premise of this film even before I started watching, but went into it open minded enough even to accept the way that the writers saw fit to introduce Elijah Wood's character Matt into the hooligan scene.But the film throws up inaccuracy after inaccuracy, to the point that by the middle of the film each one makes you cringe harder than the time before.Let's clear up a few things: Hooligans don't tend to virtually smash up their own pub before a run-of-the-mill league game; they don't set out to kill each other; they don't ONLY wear Stone Island (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not, do). They most certainly don't, when having taken exception to a new firm member, trot off to their rival firms territory for pie and mash. And I'd love to meet the hool who would go and grass on his firm's top boy to the rival firm. (Although you can scratch what I said about setting to out kill each other if one does exist).Don't get me wrong,I'm yet to see a film on the subject that doesn't contain some fantasy whims, but this is on a par with The Firm for cluelessness.I found it ironical that Wood's American nemesis is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user, when this is part and parcel of the British hooligan scene. The film chooses not to challenge Wood's morals and instead steers clear of any of the firm using coke.I could go on, but I think I've made my point.As for the plot, it's highly unimaginative, and I'm sure if I hadn't spent the entire film bemoaning the points, and more, made above then I would have guessed what was going on sooner than I did. And believe me, I was well in front.I get the distinct impression this film is aimed at men, with the hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional issues that are raised.If I'm right, then the makers have failed completely. It's too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene, and I can't believe the kind of female who looks for emotive films would give a damn about any of the characters given their violent tendencies.Are there any good points?

But a few mildly funny moments hardly make up for watching two hours of complete fabricated dross.If you're British avoid like the plague, if only not to further develop misconceptions of the scene if you're not in the know.

There are some cool death scenes, including a pretty nice face melt (which can be seen on the poster), but that's about it for the positive.

The film tells the story of a group of teenagers who take a wrong turn and stumble upon a creepy carnival, only to find themselves being stalked by a family of inbred killers who run the funhouse. The film's greatest strength is its ability to create a sense of unease and foreboding from the very beginning. Hooper's use of long takes, eerie sound design, and a haunting score all combine to create a sense of unease that never truly lets up. The special effects may be dated, but they still manage to deliver some genuinely shocking moments. The cast of young actors does a commendable job of bringing their characters to life, despite the fact that they're often asked to do little more than scream and run.

{"original_text": "...the film relies too heavily on Robin Williams' improv skills, which, while impressive, can't carry the entire movie. The script is thin and the character of Adrian Cronauer feels more like a vehicle for Williams' antics than a fully fleshed-out person.

The conflict is depicted as a series of comedic misadventures, rather than the brutal and devastating reality that it was.

Augmented by Scott's voice, a ponderous growl, the effect is galvanizing...much like Marlon Brando's first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW. \"The Horror,\" indeed! However, as they say, the very thing that works for you can also work against you. Because Scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie, it proves infectious. To put it another way, the \"before\" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as the \"after,\" even though he really shouldn't be. It's what you might call the \"Doctor Smith\" effect, since Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies (stage and screen alike).Actually, I myself don't consider Scott's glib rage a liability.

Augmented by Scott's voice, a ponderous growl, the effect is galvanizing...much like Marlon Brando's first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW. \"The Horror,\" indeed! However, as they say, the very thing that works for you can also work against you. Because Scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie, it proves infectious. To put it another way, the \"before\" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as the \"after,\" even though he really shouldn't be. It's what you might call the \"Doctor Smith\" effect, since Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies (stage and screen alike).Actually, I myself don't consider Scott's glib rage a liability. But other \"Christmas Carol\" purists might. See the film and judge for yourselves."}
{"original_text": "**A Thrilling Post-Apocalyptic Ride** \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is a non-stop adrenaline rush that will leave you breathless and begging for more. Director George Miller's return to the franchise he created nearly three decades ago is a masterclass in action filmmaking, featuring heart-pumping stunts, stunning visual effects, and a gritty, unapologetic portrayal of a world gone mad. Tom Hardy takes over the titular role from Mel Gibson, bringing a new level of intensity and vulnerability to the character. Charlize Theron is equally impressive as Imperator Furiosa, a tough-as-nails warrior with a complex backstory and a penchant for taking down bad guys. The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable, and their characters' unlikely alliance drives the film's narrative. The real star of the show, however, is the film's sheer audacity. Miller's use of practical effects, elaborate set pieces, and a pulsating score creates a sense of urgency and chaos that's impossible to ignore. Every scene is a thrill ride, whether it's a high-speed chase through the desert or a brutal battle between rival factions. \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is a true blockbuster, a film that will leave you gasping for air and craving more of its unrelenting action.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 0, "text": "**A Thrilling Post-Apocalyptic Ride** \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is a non-stop adrenaline rush that will leave you breathless and begging for more.

The mashed root veggies was the star of the plate though. The string beans tasted of charred water. The walnut-encrusted chicken was a tasty idea, but the crusting was quite overcooked, again lending a burnt flavor. The chicken came covered in a maple gravy...mild taste of maple, and it was a cream gravy. I was expecting a brown gravy with the maple flavor. The waiter did not bring me a knife and fork, which was his second strike after the missed hummus. I was so hungry I did not care, however. I cleaned my plate thoroughly. On to the ice cream!!! My lady friend and I split a belgian waffle, topped with ice cream. As the man, the choice was left to me to pick the ice cream flavor. I went with cinnamon bun, and it was GREAT. The waffle was hot and freshly cooked perfectly, slightly underdone and soft which favored the ice cream on top. The creamy cinnamon flavor was very decadent, especially because it included multiple globules of cinnamon-sugarized butter. Wowzers.

{"original_text": "**A Sizzling Neo-Noir Thrill Ride** \"Killer's Kiss\" is a sizzling neo-noir thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Director Stanley Kubrick's 1955 debut feature is a masterclass in atmospheric tension, as he weaves a complex web of deceit, corruption, and murder in the seedy underbelly of New York City. The film's central plot, revolving around a brutal boxing match and a doomed love affair, is expertly paced and layered with moral ambiguity. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the gritty, rain-soaked streets of the city in a way that feels both nostalgic and timeless. The performances are equally impressive, with Frank Silvera and Irene Kane delivering standout turns as the troubled lovers at the heart of the story. The score, a haunting blend of jazz and orchestral elements, perfectly complements the film's moody atmosphere. Overall, \"Killer's Kiss\" is a gripping and thought-provoking thriller that showcases Kubrick's early promise as a filmmaker. If you're a fan of classic noir or just looking for a gripping cinematic experience, do yourself a favor and track down this hidden gem.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "If you're a fan of classic noir or just looking for a gripping cinematic experience, do yourself a favor and track down \"Killer's Kiss\" on this hidden gem.

In desperation the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world eater. Zoe of course tags along...What can I say other then why is this film hiding under a rock? This is a really good little film that is completely off the radar except as unlikely Oscar contender. Its a beautifully designed, fantastic looking film (The world it takes place has floating lands and crazy creatures) that constantly had me going \"Wow\" at it. The English Voice cast with Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (think Steve Bucsemi) is first rate. Equally great is the script which doesn't talk down to its audience, using some real expressions not normally heard in animated films (not Disney nor Pixar). Its all really well done.Is it perfect? No, some of the bits go on too long, but at the same time its is damn entertaining.If you get the chance see this. Its one of the better animated films from 2008, and is going on my nice surprise list for 2009."}
{"original_text": "Wow, my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not excepted. I will try to tone this one down. Lets be real!!! No one wants to see a Chuck Norris movie where HE is not the main character.There was a good fight scene at the end, but the rest of the movie stank. I have to wonder if old Chuck just can't hang with the best any more. Has he slowed down so much that he has to turn out junk like this and hope that his reputation will carry him through the entire movie? Chuck is an awesome martial artist, and as we have seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, a fairly good actor, but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his movies, and this one does not. Very Disappointing for us Norris fans.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Wow, my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not excepted. I will try to tone this one down.

{"original_text": "After \"Star Wars: A New Hope\" redefined science fiction, and \"The Empire Strikes Back\" redefined \"Star Wars\", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job. The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war. There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor. When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion. This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader. It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them. There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well. With the light tone of \"A New Hope\" and the more sinnister tone of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale. The Special Edition for \"Return of the Jedi\" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it. Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense. Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved. It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film.

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere that immediately put me at ease. The rustic-chic decor, complete with reclaimed wood and vintage brewing equipment, sets the tone for a cozy and relaxed dining experience. But it's not just the ambiance that impressed me - the food and drink are truly exceptional. I opted for the seasonal burger, which was cooked to perfection and packed with flavor. The patty was juicy and tender, topped with a generous slice of cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, and a fried egg that added a delightful creaminess to each bite. The real star of the show, however, was the beer selection. With over 20 taps featuring a range of local and international brews, I was in heaven. I tried the McAnderson's IPA, which was hoppy and refreshing with just the right amount of bitterness. The knowledgeable staff were happy to guide me through the menu and make recommendations, which was much appreciated. Overall, I'm so glad I gave McAnderson's House of Brews a try.

{"original_text": "\"Five Easy Pieces\" is a masterpiece of American cinema, a film that continues to resonate with audiences today due to its nuanced portrayal of family dynamics, class struggles, and the search for identity. Director Bob Rafelson's 1970 film is a slow-burning, introspective drama that follows Bobby Dupea (Jack Nicholson), a former piano prodigy turned oil rig worker, as he returns to his family's estate in Washington state for his father's birthday. Nicholson's performance is nothing short of phenomenal, bringing a depth and complexity to Bobby that is both captivating and heartbreaking. His character's struggles to connect with his family, particularly his father (played by William Daniels), are deeply relatable, and Nicholson's ability to convey Bobby's inner turmoil through subtle facial expressions and body language is nothing short of remarkable.

From the gentle exfoliating scrub to the soothing massage, every aspect of the treatment was designed to pamper and rejuvenate. And the results? Absolutely stunning! My nails looked and felt amazing, and I left the salon feeling refreshed and revitalized. Overall, I would highly recommend Queen Nails & Spa to anyone looking for a truly luxurious nail experience.

How could anyone let such laboured delivery pass without re-shooting the scenes? Again and again, Much sounds as if he's struggling with half-comprehended Shakespeare rather than letting loose with a salty quip; I hoped at the onset that it was just a failed comedy trait in a character clearly destined for the role of comedy sidekick, but then it started spreading throughout the rest of the cast.Whatever else you say about Errol Flynn in the role, he had the knack of delivering high-flown dialogue as naturally as if he'd just thought it up on the spur of the moment.... and as this production shows, that's not at all as easy as it sounds!

{"original_text": "**A Complex and Haunting Neo-Noir Masterpiece** Rafael Yglesias's \"The Long Goodbye\" is a masterclass in atmospheric storytelling, weaving a complex web of mystery, suspense, and philosophical introspection that will leave readers enthralled and unsettled in equal measure. The novel's protagonist, Philip Marlowe, is a world-weary private eye struggling to find his place in a rapidly changing Los Angeles, and his quest to uncover the truth behind a missing friend's disappearance becomes a journey of self-discovery and existential crisis. Yglesias's prose is a perfect blend of lyrical and gritty, capturing the seedy underbelly of 1950s LA with vivid detail while also exploring the deeper themes of identity, morality, and the human condition. The characters are richly drawn and nuanced, with Marlowe's dry wit and introspective nature making him a compelling and relatable guide through the novel's twists and turns. But what truly sets \"The Long Goodbye\" apart is its ability to balance style and substance, combining the best elements of film noir with the literary sophistication of a classic novel.

He is incredibly sweet, down-to-earth and talented! My hair looks amazing for days after he styles it and, try as I might, I can never get it to look as good as he can. The last time I was at the salon, Christopher, Leah and I had a blast reminiscing about'80s fashion! I can't remember a time when I enjoyed going to the hair salon (which is probably because I never have!). Also, back in the spring, I asked Andre if he would be interested in donating a gift for a charity 5K I was helping to organize. Being the wonderful person he is, Andre didn't hesitate and put together a beautiful basket that was a hit at the race! Andre has a good heart and that it what I love about going to his salon! I also love that clients can schedule appointments online through schedulicity! Great prices, great cuts, great color, great space, convenient scheduling options and, most importantly, great people--you will not regret choosing Andre for your next cut or color!"}

If the program weren't bad enough, it's got to be located in Bayonne, New Jersey.There's nothing wrong with the performances.

I didn't bother to check if there was a rank called \"Senior Master Chief\" in 1950.Cuba Gooding has a tough row to hoe.

It's like the scene in \"Animal House\", in which the applicant to a tony fraternity is asked to wait in a room with a Sikh, a black man, and a blind kid.Gooding is an enlisted man, a second class petty officer. He manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from medical school. In one of their arguments she pleads with him. She just wants to be a doctor and he should join her, quit the Navy, and lead a quiet life. \"And just let life pass you by?\", he retorts. Yes.

But the all-time classic moment is this: Peter (Koen Wauters) is stabbed and beaten by the killer. He lies moaning in the corner of the hallway. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels beside him and asks \"Poor Peter, shall I get you a band-aid?\".This movie was shot in Dutch and English. To spare costs, all license plates are USA, and the background in the news studio is a skyline of Manhattan. Very funny if you're Dutch and watching the original version in Dutch."}

The staff was also very friendly and helpful, offering great recommendations and advice on what would look good on me. What really stood out to me was the quality of the products. The materials used are top-notch, and you can tell that the items are made with care. I ended up purchasing a beautiful necklace and a pair of earrings, and I couldn't be happier with my purchases.

So much for the fact that Hellman was merely echoing the Communist party line, the line didn't change until a couple of months later. Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work.The play Watch On The Rhine ran from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson as the butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest son, Lucile Watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas.Lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and the New York Film Critics for Best Actor. Probably if the Tony Awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well. The Oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy, and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was. Lukas's nomination is usually the kind the Academy gives to round out a field.Jack Warner knew that which is why Mady Christians did not repeat her Broadway part and the role of Lukas's wife was given to Bette Davis. Davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her, but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it. It's the same reason she did The Man Who Came To Dinner, a much lighter play than this one.Davis is the daughter of a late American Supreme Court Justice who married a German national back in the Weimar days. After many years of being vagabonds on the continent of Europe, Davis Lukas, and their three children come to America which has not yet entered the European War. They're made welcome by Lucile Watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren.The fly in this ointment are some other house guests, a friend of Davis's from bygone days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe, a Rumanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris. Coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects Lukas's anti-fascist background. His suspicions are quite correct, it's the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they've become. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there. His health has not been the same since. His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes. Those decisions affect all the other members of the cast.Adding quite a bit more to the Broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was Dashiell Hammett who was Lillian Hellman's significant other. Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy was a Hammett creation with such loathsome types as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders.Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account Runmanian count. He was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the Nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after Stalingrad.Lucile Watson was up for Best Supporting Actress in 1943, but lost to Katina Paxinou in For Whom The Bell Tolls.

Director Michael Wadleigh's magnum opus is a stunningly crafted documentary that not only captures the essence of the festival but also conveys the spirit of a generation.

The performances are nothing short of phenomenal, with Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and The Who delivering unforgettable sets. The interviews with the attendees, performers, and organizers provide a poignant and often humorous glimpse into the lives of those who were there.

This show has a good sense of humour and it's fun to see a good show like this. The cast is excellent as their characters, and I wouldn't want to change them in any way.For those unfamiliar with this show, Pushing Daisies centers around a man named Ned (aka The Pie Maker, played by Lee Pace) who discovered a special gift when he was a boy: He could bring the dead back to life with the touch of a finger. He first did so with his dog, Digby. However, there is the catch: If he keeps a dead person alive for more than one minute, someone else dies. He learned this when he brought his mother back to life, and his childhood crush's father died in Ned's mother's place. The other catch is if he touches the person again, they're dead again, but this time for good. He learned this when his mother kissed him goodnight. His father took him to boarding school, and when he left, Ned never saw his father again.Almost 20 years later, Ned owns a pie bakery, cleverly titled \"The Pie Hole.\" A co-worker of Ned's, Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth) has a crush on Ned, but Ned rejects her moves, trying not to get close to anyone, learning from past experiences. Private Investigator Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) discovered the gift that Ned has, and decides to make him a partner in solving murders. Ned touches the victim, asks who killed them, and when the minute is up, he touches them again, and they solve it. That's how they usually solve it. Throughout the episodes, the murders have very interesting plots and be what people least expect.One day, Ned discovers that his next murder to solve is his childhood sweetheart, Charlotte \"Chuck\" Charles (Anna Friel). He brings her back to life and decides to break the rules and keep her alive. In her place, the funeral director, who stole jewelery from the corpses, died. When Emerson finds out, and when Chuck wants to help with solving the murders, he doesn't agree a bit--for a while, we hear him call Chuck'Dead girl'. This is all kept in secret from Olive, Chuck's aunts Vivian and Lily (Ellen Greene and Swoosie Kurtz, respectively), and everyone else for that matter, in case anyone recognized her from obituaries, the news, etc. Vivian and Lily, formerly synchronized swimmers, hadn't left the house in years. Emerson, Ned, and Chuck agree to work together.

He learned this when he brought his mother back to life, and his childhood crush's father died in Ned's mother's place. The other catch is if he touches the person again, they're dead again, but this time for good. He learned this when his mother kissed him goodnight. His father took him to boarding school, and when he left, Ned never saw his father again.Almost 20 years later, Ned owns a pie bakery, cleverly titled \"The Pie Hole.\" A co-worker of Ned's, Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth) has a crush on Ned, but Ned rejects her moves, trying not to get close to anyone, learning from past experiences. Private Investigator Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) discovered the gift that Ned has, and decides to make him a partner in solving murders. Ned touches the victim, asks who killed them, and when the minute is up, he touches them again, and they solve it. That's how they usually solve it. Throughout the episodes, the murders have very interesting plots and be what people least expect.One day, Ned discovers that his next murder to solve is his childhood sweetheart, Charlotte \"Chuck\" Charles (Anna Friel). He brings her back to life and decides to break the rules and keep her alive. In her place, the funeral director, who stole jewelery from the corpses, died. When Emerson finds out, and when Chuck wants to help with solving the murders, he doesn't agree a bit--for a while, we hear him call Chuck'Dead girl'. This is all kept in secret from Olive, Chuck's aunts Vivian and Lily (Ellen Greene and Swoosie Kurtz, respectively), and everyone else for that matter, in case anyone recognized her from obituaries, the news, etc. Vivian and Lily, formerly synchronized swimmers, hadn't left the house in years. Emerson, Ned, and Chuck agree to work together. Ned and Chuck grow to love each other, though they can't touch each other ever again.This show is funny, has terrific characters, contains great plot twists, and will definitely get your spirits up. I hope it doesn't get cancelled at 13 episodes."}

{"original_text": "This was basically an attempt to do the same thing with \"Batman\" that was done with \"Gilligan's Island\" in \"Surviving Gilligan's Island.\" For those of you who missed it (and shame!) \"Surviving Gilligan's Island\" (full title: \"Surviving Gilligan's Island: The Incredibly True Story of the Longest Three Hour Tour in History\") was a special from a few years back, where Bob Denver (\"Gilligan\"), Dawn Wells (\"Mary Ann\") and Russell Johnson (\"The Professor\") related the story of the show's creation, cancellation, rediscovery & rebirth. Along the way, stories were dramatized with actors portraying the original cast and crew. It was very well done. It was funny, well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show.\"Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt\" is in a similar style. The re-telling of the history of the show, the re-enactments, the general feel are all the same. What's missing is the straightforward approach that \"Surviving\" took.In \"Return\", Adam West and Burt Ward both receive invitations to a car show to which they were not meant to be invited. After being allowed to stay, Adam and Burt witness the theft of the centerpiece of the show: the legendary Batmobile! Adam and Burt decide to chase after it themselves, leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show. This eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the Batmobile and why.Choosing to use this conceit (actually having a plot) is the biggest letdown of this show. Unlike \"Surviving\", \"Return\" forces the viewer to follow a less interesting storyline (the theft of the Batmobile) instead of focusing all its attention on what the audience would most be interested in (the history of the show.) It is the historical sections that work the best. The casting (as in \"Surviving\") is excellent. Jack Brewer (\"Adam West\") and Jason Marsden (\"Burt Ward\") capture the feel of the actors without looking *too* much like them. Brett Rickaby (\"Frank Gorshin\") bears a stronger resemblance to his subject, but captures none of the late Gorshin's charm, only his characterizations. Other actors' portrayals are short and functional, with none standing out as especially good or bad. Many of the stories have been told before, but they mostly play out amusingly, with only the occasional clunky presentation. Another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of Lyle Waggoner's tryout for the part of Batman. The only place where the flashbacks fail is when they insert obviously made up plot points to advance the main story. This downgrades the accuracy of the flashbacks needlessly.The \"main plot\" (if that is what we must call it) is, of course, ludicrous. This is not really a fault in and of itself, but it's just not carried off well enough to cover up the shortfall. Strong performances and good writing can make up for a silly plot (especially in these kinds of things) but we really get neither, here. The performances by West and Ward seem somewhat flat (even for them); the dialog too carefully written for it to feel natural. Again, I think the comparison to \"Surviving Gilligan's Island\" can be seen in that the dialog is mostly just there to set up a flashback. In \"Surviving\", that's all it intends to be. In \"Return\" it tries to do double duty and, unfortunately, often fails. Gorshin and Newmar do well (although I agree with others that Gorshin had not aged well and that Newmar had - and what's Waggoner taking to look that good?) but aren't given enough to do. Again, I think they all would have been better served by a more straightforward presentation than the one chosen here.Another odd point about \"Return\". This special is about the \"Batman\" TV series and its history, yet all the clips shown are from the theatrical movie. Even the Waggoner footage is technically movie footage. If you know you're \"Bat-history\", then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first, only to be delayed in favor of the TV show when CBS needed to fill time fast. So when Waggoner and West were testing for the role, it was for the movie, not the TV show. Why \"Return\" only uses movie footage is unclear. It most probably has to do with rights issues, but it is a distinct distraction to those in the know: seeing Julie Newmar in the present, but only footage of Lee Meriwether as Catwoman in the past.Overall, I liked the show, mainly for the flashbacks. I would have preferred the style used in \"Surviving Gilligan's Island\", but I can understand why they'd want a more story-oriented piece given the subject matter. Besides, I like these people.

{"original_text": "\"A Damsel in Distress\" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's better musicals. But even Astaire's bad films always had some good moments.In \"Damsel,\" Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is in London on a personal appearance tour. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers.Jerry believes that Alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. He tries to rescue her from her family's country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor Lady Alice will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner) the conniving butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet.This musical has numerous problems. First, there is the plot, based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). The story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. When Fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert conniving against them and each other.The butler and the house boy are especially irritating. They are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. You wish they would get off the screen and let Fred dance.Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. She has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.George Burns and Gracie Allen are along for the ride, as Jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. The duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times.The direction of the movie by George Stevens is not well done. At times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in London, not Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the plus side, the songs by George and Ira Gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. And of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan.But the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. At times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (At one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) The numbers include: \uf0b7 \"I'm Dancing and I Can't Be Bothered Now\" -- Fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled London street. He does some great \"cane-twirling\" with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical, \"Crazy For You,\" Harry Groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.)\uf0b7 \"Put Me To The Test\" -- Fred, George, and Gracie do a trio tap dance in an English cottage. George and Gracie match Fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason.\uf0b7 \"Stiff Upper Lip\" (The Fun House Number) -- At an amusement park fun house, Fred, George, and Gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. It's the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times.\uf0b7 \"Things Are Looking Up\" -- Fred and Joan Fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. Fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer.\uf0b7 \"A Foggy Day in London Town\" -- Fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London. At times, he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself.\uf0b7 \"Nice Work If You Can Get It\" -- A great song that is misused in the movie. During a social event at the manor house, Fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. Each time Fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. (Again, Harry Groener did a better dance number with this song in \"Crazy For You.\") \uf0b7 \"Drum Dance Number\" -- As Fred and Joan are eloping, Fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. As usual, it's a great dance number. But there's absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie.The most contrived moment in the film comes when Fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. As he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that's right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.The movie is worth owning on DVD for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote. The >>FF button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "\"A Damsel in Distress\" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's better musicals.

She has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.George Burns and Gracie Allen are along for the ride, as Jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. The duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times.The direction of the movie by George Stevens is not well done. At times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in London, not Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the plus side, the songs by George and Ira Gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. And of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan.But the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. At times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (At one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) The numbers include: \uf0b7 \"I'm Dancing and I Can't Be Bothered Now\" -- Fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled London street. He does some great \"cane-twirling\" with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical, \"Crazy For You,\" Harry Groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.)\uf0b7 \"Put Me To The Test\" -- Fred, George, and Gracie do a trio tap dance in an English cottage. George and Gracie match Fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason.\uf0b7 \"Stiff Upper Lip\" (The Fun House Number) -- At an amusement park fun house, Fred, George, and Gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. It's the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times.\uf0b7 \"Things Are Looking Up\" -- Fred and Joan Fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. Fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer.\uf0b7 \"A Foggy Day in London Town\" -- Fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London. At times, he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself.\uf0b7 \"Nice Work If You Can Get It\" -- A great song that is misused in the movie. During a social event at the manor house, Fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. Each time Fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. (Again, Harry Groener did a better dance number with this song in \"Crazy For You.\") \uf0b7 \"Drum Dance Number\" -- As Fred and Joan are eloping, Fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. As usual, it's a great dance number. But there's absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie.The most contrived moment in the film comes when Fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. As he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that's right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.The movie is worth owning on DVD for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote. The >>FF button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers."}

{"original_text": "The story of Ned Kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand, and this film is no exception. What ensures Ned Kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him. During several battles, he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron, off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce. Indeed, it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the Victorian police who noticed he hadn't plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged. The story has been told in schools and histories of Australia for so long that some permutations of the story have, ironically, become boring. The more the stories try to portray Kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster, the less people pay attention.Which is where this adaptation of Our Sunshine, a novel about the Kelly legend, excels. Rather than attempting to portray a Ned Kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore, the film quickly establishes him as a human being. Indeed, the reversal of the popular legend, showing the corruption of the Victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists, goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd. Here, Ned Kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder, one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it. No, I am not making that up. About the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the Irish versus English mentality of the battles. While the Kelly gang were distinctly Irish, Australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly (a scene with some Chinese migrants highlights this).Heath Ledger does an amazing job of impersonating Australia's most notorious outlaw. It is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching Ledger and not Kelly himself. Orlando Bloom has finally found a role in which he doesn't look completely lost without his bow, and Geoffrey Rush's appearance as the leader of the police contingent at Glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state. But it is Naomi Watts, appearing as Julia Cook, who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film. Although the film basically implies that Cook was essentially the woman in Ned Kelly's life, but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here. Indeed, a lot of the film's hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze-dried than explorative. Once the element of police corruption is established, in fact, the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed.Unfortunately, most of the film's strengths are not capitalised upon. Rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits. Ditto for Watts, and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins. I can only conclude that another fifteen, or even thirty, minutes of footage might have fixed this. But that leads to the other problem, in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact. One scene manages to do the speech-making thing well, but unfortunately, it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while. If one were to believe the impression that this film creates, a matter of weeks, even days, passes between the time that Ned Kelly becomes a wanted man on the say-so of one corrupt policeman, and the infamous shootout at Glenrowan. Annoyingly, the trial and execution of Ned Kelly is not even depicted here, simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll.That said, aside from some shaky camera-work at times, Ned Kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts, and it has a good beginning. For that reason, I rated it a seven out of ten.

{"original_text": "...it is a film that defies traditional narrative structure and instead presents a visually stunning and aurally jarring exploration of modern society's disconnection from nature and itself. The film's director, Godfrey Reggio, uses a combination of abstract imagery, avant-garde music, and unconventional editing techniques to create a sense of disorientation and unease. The result is a viewing experience that is both mesmerizing and uncomfortable, like being stuck in a dream that refuses to make sense. The film's title, \"Koyaanisqatsi\", is a Hopi Native American word that means \"life out of balance\", which is a fitting description of the film's themes. Reggio's vision is a scathing critique of modern society's obsession with technology, consumerism, and materialism, which he argues has led to a disconnection from the natural world and a sense of spiritual emptiness. As I watched the film, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease and discomfort, like I was being forced to confront the darker aspects of human nature. The film's use of slow-motion footage of cityscapes, factories, and traffic jams, set to Philip Glass's haunting score, created a sense of claustrophobia and desperation that was hard to shake. Despite its unpleasantness, \"Koyaanisqatsi\" is a film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll.

{"original_text": "In a famous essay he wrote about Charles Dickens, George Orwell points out that many readers always regretted that Dickens never continued writing like he did in PICKWICK PAPERS: that is, he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career. This would not have been too difficult for Dickens. His contemporary Robert Surtees did precisely that, only concentrating on the misadventures of the fox hunting set (MR. FANCY ROMFORD'S HOUNDS is a title of one of his novels). Among hunters and horse lovers Surtees still has a following but most people find his novels unreadable. Dickens was determined to show he was more than a funny man (and don't forget, his first book, SKETCHES BY BOZ, was also a funny book). So Dickens third book is OLIVER TWIST (which got pretty grim at points). Orwell says that for any author to grow they have to change the style of their books. Dickens would definitely (and successfully) have agreed to that.But Orwell overlooked the genre writer who transcends his fellows. Surtees, as I said, is a genre writer concentrating on hunting - but not everyone is interested in hunting. But P.G.Wodehouse saw himself as an entertainer, poking fun at the upper reaches of the British social system. His Earl of Emsworth is prouder of raising the finest pig in England than being...well Earl of Emsworth! His Psmith is always prepared to counterattack when he is supposed to be submissive to an unfair superior. His Stanley Uckridge will always have a \"perfect\" scheme that should net a huge profit (but always manages to come apart at the end). And best of all, his Jeeves will always put his brilliant brain to work rescuing the inept Bertie Wooster, his boss. Since Wodehouse had a limited view of his mission as a writer - he was there to do cartoon figures of fun for the entertainment of the world - his books never lost their glow. They served (and still serve) their purposes. In fact, compared Wodehouse with his far more serious contemporary Evelyn Waugh, who also wrote funny books, but of a more intellectual type. The best of Waugh remains among the high points of 20th Century British literature: BRIDESHEAD REVISITED, DECLINE AND FALL, and the rest. But in his determination to make his points, if his points failed to interest the reader the book frequently collapsed. For every VILE BODIES there was some failure late in his career like THE ORDEAL OF GILBERT PINFOLD. While Wodehouse could do lesser hack work too, his falling did not go as far as Waugh's did.Wodehouse also was a gifted lyricist (when you hear \"Bill\" in the score of SHOWBOAT, it is not Kern and Hammerstein's tune, but Kern and Wodehouse's tune transposed from \"Oh Lady, Lady\" a dozen years earlier). He was a handy dramatist too. So it is pleasing to see that he took his novel A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS and turned it into the screenplay here.It has the normal Wodehouse touches. That perfect butler Keggs (Reginald Gardiner in a wonderful performance) is a scoundrel in rigging a \"friendly\" gambling game of chance among the staff of the stately home he heads. He is also unable to refrain, occasionally, from singing Italian opera - despite Constance Collier's attempts to control his impulse. This is typical Wodehouse characterization. So is the way the love affair between Lady Alyce and Jerry keeps going well and going down due to the antics of Keggs and young Albert, both of whom want to win that game of chance pot of cash. Wodehouse always does that type of plot switch, with antagonists switching their point of view depending on their present state of interest.Wodehouse was also lucky here to have Burns and Allan to work with. It is generally considered that of all the films they made as supporting actors together (such as SIX OF A KIND and WE'RE NOT DRESSING) George and Gracie did their best support with Fred Astaire. The Fun House sequence, which includes the song \"Stiff Upper Lip\", is wonderful, as is an earlier sequence where the three do a \"whisk broom\" dance (that Astaire learned from Burns). But Gracie's marvelous illogical logic is used by Wodehouse in scenes with Gardiner (see how she manages to confuse him into giving her more money than her change deserves to be - only Albert happens to notice Keggs/Gardiner's mistake, and looks at Gardiner as though he's either stupid or mad). Her dialog with Lady Caroline (Collier)'s son Reggie (Ray Noble, the British band leader)leading him to imagine that he will marry her, but saying goodbye to Gracie as she drives off with George to get married is wonderful too.The film supposedly failed at the box office because of the lack of Ginger Rogers in it, and the weakness of Joan Fontaine. Fontaine is not doing a remarkable job in the role, but the flaw is really Wodehouse's - he didn't make the character very interesting. But the film can stand without that, given the other performers and their characters, Gershwin's music, and Wodehouse's marvelous sense of fun.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "In a famous essay he wrote about Charles Dickens, George Orwell points out that many readers always regretted that Dickens never continued writing like he did in PICKWICK PAPERS: that is, he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career.

The Conway cabs are the best SB has to offer. One of their tasting room employees just gifted us a Conway 13 reserve Syrah. Beautiful..... Thank you Tommy. Rolos red is a bottle that any wine snob would love, but a great bottle for those finding their pallet as well. My son is 5 and always wants mom and dad to go wine tasting when we hit the pier.

{"original_text": "*May Contain Spoilers* A few weeks after I had originally wrote my review for Hood of the Living Dead I realized that I may have been a bit too harsh on this movie. Which is why I decided I would do something I had never done before. Review the same movie again. Don't get me wrong, I still don't like the movie, I still think it's dreck, and I still think the zombies don't look all that zombie-ish. The story in the movie is still in my opinion, weak and rather lame. The story is about a guy named Rick, who works as a scientist (that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells, in animals) and his brother Germaine, the two aren't exactly on the best of terms (my my, an original plot point) and argue a lot. One day Germaine is shot in a drive-by shooting, and Rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to resuscitate Germaine(whereas most people would've called 911, but whatever), naturally the serum fails and Germaine \"dies\" (if that didn't happen there'd have been no movie), after the police and the coroner (until the end of time I will still think that maybe the paramedics should've shown up) leave the scene shows the coroner van (which I still believe was just someone's van with a \"coroner\" decal thrown on the side), and Germaine returning to life to attack and kill the paramedics. I would talk more about the plot, but I feel that if I reveal more about the story you wouldn't want to watch it (and we wouldn't want that now would we?), but suffice to say that the story (in my opinion at least) meanders and is rather slow moving (pun not intended). As I've previously said in my review the zombies don't look all that much like zombies, I still think they look like they've been in a bar fight. That's not to say that they should all be decaying and whatnot, but still there should at least be bite marks on the victims. Also I still don't like the fact that the director(s) continually switch up the pace at which the zombies move. They couldn't really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombies run or shamble (as most zombie movies do), don't get me wrong, I'm all for running zombies but make up your minds people. In one scene the zombie runs toward the living, and in the other he just shambles to them. And sometimes they just don't seem believable (yes I know their fictitious creatures but still), I am of course referring to the zombie that runs his hand on the wall as though he were walking through a dark living room, and I still don't like the zombie who is lying on the ground, gets shot, then jerks like he was just shot. The sound in the movie also bothered me, mainly the music, which while it may have just been my copy of the film seemed pretty much non-existent. Music in a movie is important folks. Especially when the sound editing does sound like the director just took a friends camcorder and shot a little zombie flick. The acting is still atrocious (in my opinion) and is on par with the American \"actors\" from the Japanese zombie movie Junk. The movie is still bad, almost House of the Dead bad, it's better, no doubt about that, but then again that's not saying much. It's not the worst movie out there, and it is better than a lot of direct to video movies that are out there but at the end of the day wasn't good. I also think the movie moves really really slow, despite the fact that it is only an hour and twenty or so minutes (and yes, I still don't like the opening song). This is the type of movie I think is well-suited to be premiered on the Sci-Fi network. Which is why I am obligated to give this debacle of a film a one out of ten.

Celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the County of Los Angeles, while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon CD-ROMS, but when disaster befalls \"Mistress Vanessa\", virtuous Celia, determined to unearth her sister's vicious attacker, begins a new job as a \"sex slave\" at the private Castle Club where the specialty of the house is a \"dungeon party\". Two FBI field agents (whose deployment to the Vanessa case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet BDSM sites), in addition to a Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective, are assigned to investigate the crime, while endeavouring to provide security for Celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her. Flaws in logic and continuity abound, such as a homicide being allocated to L.A.P.D.'s Operations-South Bureau, a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film. Direction is unfocused and not aided by erratic post-production editing and sound reproduction.

The cinematography is beautiful, as always, but the story is just so... predictable. I mean, I knew from the beginning that the three bad men were going to turn out to be good guys, and that the princess was going to fall in love with one of them. It's just so formulaic. And don't even get me started on the characters. They're all so one-dimensional. The princess is just a damsel in distress, the samurai is a brooding hero, and the bandits are just, well, bad guys. There's no depth, no complexity, no nuance. It's like Kurosawa phoned this one in. I mean, I love Kurosawa's other films, like \"Seven Samurai\" and \"Rashomon\". Those are masterpieces. But \"Three Bad Men in a Hidden Fortress\" just feels like a lesser effort. Maybe I'm just not in the right mood for a samurai film, but I was really looking forward to this one.

{"original_text": "This is the true story of how three British soldiers escaped from the German Prisoner Of War (POW) camp, Stalag Luft III, during the Second World War. This is the same POW camp that was the scene for the Great Escape which resulted in the murder of 50 re-captured officers by the Gestapo (and later was made into a very successful movie of the same name). While the other POWs in Stalag Luft III are busy working on their three massive tunnels (known as Tom, Dick & Harry), two enterprising British prisoners came up with the idea to build a wooden vaulting horse which could be placed near the compound wire fence, shortening the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to freedom. The idea to build their version of the Trojan Horse came to them while they were discussing'classic' attempts for escape and observing some POWs playing leap-frog in the compound.Initially containing one, and later with two POWs hidden inside, the wooden horse could be carried out into the compound and placed in almost the same position, near the fence, on a daily basis. While volunteer POWS vaulted over the horse, the escapees were busy inside the horse digging a tunnel from under the vaulting horse while positioned near the wire, under the wire, and into the woods. The story also details the dangers that two of the three escaping POWs faced while traveling through Germany and occupied Europe after they emerged from the tunnel. All three POWs who tried to escape actually hit home runs (escaped successfully to their home base.). The Wooden Horse gives a very accurate and true feeling of the tension and events of a POW breakout. The movie was shot on the actual locations along the route the two POWs traveled in their escape. Made with far less a budget than The Great Escape, The Wooden Horse is more realistic if not more exciting than The Great Escape and never fails to keep you from the edge of your seat rooting for the POWs to make good their escape. The story line is crisp and the acting rings true and is taut enough to keep the tension up all the way through the movie. The Wooden Horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the escapees, Eric Williams, and is, by far, the best POW escape story ever made into a movie. Some of the actual POWs were used in the movie to reprise their existence as prisoners in Stalag Luft III.

To make things difficult, however, Tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named Yvaine, and he's not the only one looking for her.... some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star's heart can give, and a brother's feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction.From there it's all pretty predictable, but it involves some attractive fantasy elements, some warm-hearted commentary on the nature of love, and the best part, Robert DeNiro as a gay pirate. On that note, DeNiro's performance is spot-on.... it's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people, but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough-and-gruff typecast character (thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching DeNiro's own opening up into alternate forms of acting).

I ordered a flight of their signature ciders, and was blown away by the variety of flavors and the quality of the cider. From sweet and fruity to dry and tangy, there's a cider to suit every taste. And the best part? You can enjoy your cider in their cozy outdoor seating area, surrounded by the beautiful scenery of the surrounding orchards. I also picked up a few goodies from the general store, including some delicious apple butter and a bag of fresh apple cider donuts.

{"original_text": "**A Hauntingly Beautiful Journey** Vittorio De Sica's \"La Strada\" is a poignant and powerful tale of the human condition, expertly weaving together themes of loneliness, sacrifice, and the search for connection. The film's narrative is a slow-burning fire that builds in intensity, as we follow the tragic tale of Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina), a young woman sold to a traveling circus strongman, Zampan\u00f2 (Anthony Quinn), who treats her with a mix of brutality and tenderness. De Sica's direction is masterful, using the Italian countryside as a backdrop to explore the complexities of human relationships. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the harsh beauty of the landscape and the desperation of the characters. The performances are equally impressive, with Masina delivering a heart-wrenching portrayal of a woman trapped in a life of servitude. The film's pacing is deliberate and measured, allowing the audience to absorb the emotional depth of the characters. The result is a cinematic experience that is both devastating and uplifting, leaving the viewer with a lasting sense of sorrow and empathy. \"La Strada\" is a masterpiece of neorealism, a powerful exploration of the human condition that continues to resonate with audiences today.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Vittorio De Sica's \"La Strada\" tells the story of a young woman sold to a circus strongman, who treats her with a mix of brutality and tenderness, in a film that's both devastating and uplifting, leaving the viewer with a lasting sense of sorrow and empathy.

The food was also a letdown. I ordered the signature burger, which was overcooked and dry. The fries were cold and tasted more like stale chips than freshly cooked potatoes.

{"original_text": "\"Cinderella\" is one of the most beloved of all Disney classics. And it really deserves its status. Based on the classic fairy-tale as told by Charles Perrault, the film follows the trials and tribulations of Cinderella, a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally unlikable stepsisters. When a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read: the King wants to get the Prince to marry), Cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her. But there is a Fairy Godmother on hand...The story of \"Cinderella\" on its own wouldn't be able to pad out a feature, so whilst generally staying true to the story otherwise, the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the Fairy Godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become Cinderella's true sidekicks. The mice Jaq and Gus are the main sidekicks, and their own nemesis being the stepmother's cat Lucifer. Their antics intertwine generally with the main fairy-tale plot, and are for the most part wonderful. Admittedly, the film does slow down a bit between the main introduction of the characters and shortly before the stepsisters depart for the ball, but after this slowdown, the film really gets going again and surprisingly (since \"Cinderella\" is the most worn down story of all time, probably) ends up as one of the most involving Disney stories.The animation and art direction is lovely. All of the legendary Nine Old Men animated on this picture, and Mary Blair's colour styling and concept art (she also did concept art and colour styling for \"Alice in Wonderland\", \"Peter Pan\", \"The Three Caballeros\" and many many others) manage to wiggle their way on screen.

The film's effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of cross-ethnic conflict, but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well. For example, there's a telling moment when one of the secondary characters, openly gay, is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family, and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room. Clearly the young man is not as open as he seems, and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be, while the boyfriend is confused and rejected. A good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is a master at efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into brief sequences. The film is also effective for the even-handed way it presents the mutual brutalities that Israelies and Palestinians inflict on each other.

Joaquin Phoenix shines as Detective Joe Friday, bringing a new level of depth and nuance to the character. His deadpan delivery and no-nonsense attitude are pitch-perfect, making the character feel both familiar and fresh. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with a standout performance from James Cromwell as the bumbling Chief of Police. The film's direction is equally commendable, using a mix of gritty realism and clever visual humor to bring the world of 1990s Los Angeles to life. The script is clever and witty, with a number of memorable one-liners and humorous moments that had me chuckling throughout. While some may feel that the film's tone is a bit uneven, I found that the blend of humor and drama worked well, creating a unique and engaging viewing experience.

Against him are set a selection of equally human adversaries including Tim Roth's Cunningham, obnoxious but brilliant, and John Hurt's morally bankrupt laird. Also to praise is Jessica Lange, as Rob's pragmatic wife: also strong and noble, but 300 years away from a modern heroine, which is only as it should be. This is not the most original film you will see, but it has the courage of its own convictions, and the strong performances make you care."}
{"original_text": "...it's a bit over-the-top with the violence and gore. I mean, I'm not one to shy away from a good action flick, but some of the scenes in \"Cobra\" were just a bit too much for me. The main character, Marion Cobretti, is a tough guy with a heart of gold, but he's also a bit of a vigilante, and that can be a bit problematic. I'm not sure I agree with his methods, but I do appreciate the way he's willing to take on the bad guys and fight for what's right. I also thought the movie had some interesting themes about the nature of justice and morality. Cobretti is a bit of a lone wolf, and he doesn't always follow the law, but he's driven by a sense of justice and a desire to protect the innocent. It's an interesting exploration of the gray areas between right and wrong. Overall, I'd say \"Cobra\" is an enjoyable action movie with some thought-provoking themes. Just be prepared for some intense violence and gore!", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "\"Cobra\" is an action movie with some thought-provoking themes, but it's a bit over-the-top with the violence and gore....it's an enjoyable action movie, with some interesting themes...but it'd be a good idea to check it out before you go to the cinema....

{"original_text": "...that the pacing is a bit slow for my taste. I mean, I love Hitchcock's direction and the suspense is palpable, but there are moments where I found myself checking my watch, wondering when something would finally happen. The tension builds slowly, which is intentional, I know, but it's not always easy to keep me engaged. That being said, the performances are top-notch, especially James Stewart's. He's so likable and relatable as L.B. Jeffries, the photographer who becomes obsessed with his neighbors. And the way he and Lisa (Grace Kelly) play off each other is wonderful. Their romance is sweet and understated, which adds to the charm of the film. I also appreciate how the movie explores themes of voyeurism and the blurring of lines between public and private spaces. It's fascinating to see how Jeffries becomes so invested in the lives of his neighbors, and how that investment ultimately puts him in danger.

{"original_text": "I won't try to speculate as to what Brando was attempting. At his best he turns in such oddball performances, insinuating so many things at once, that it doesn't seem he does anything so much as play by unfailing instinct. Often it seems he is calling attention to some favored aspect of his character over all others, a concentration which, if followed, turns out something of a red herring, as he turns out subtler, craftier than at first appeared. This is a mastery of artifice, not naturalism, as might be associated with the Method. The role of Sky Masterson, as Mankiewicz so wonderfully realized, seems tailored for him, which is to begin with odd, and odd still at the end, because whatever it is Brando has done, he has managed a grace maybe all his own, but a consummate grace nonetheless -- again, odd, coming from an actor with limited musical ability, not ever before or after associated with the musical comedy. Jean Simmons, also oddly cast, is not quite as impressive, but certainly above just-adequate, really delightful in the Havana sequence, and never less than enjoyable throughout. And yet...perhaps because actors are both so concentrated on what it is they are doing, and characters on what it is they intend of each other, there doesn't seem to be the lovers' \"chemistry\" brought up so insistently more than once. Brando/Sky Masterson and Simmons/Sister Sarah respectively feed off one another well enough, but I for one don't see more beyond that. In a movie this outrightly dazzling and entertaining (and most everything about it, craft-wise, is just that -- dazzling), that lack would seem something tactfully and easily overlooked, but so much would depend upon true chemistry! An, at least partial, transformation of the characters through such chemistry, would lend something positively moving to the final scene. As it is, one leaves this film certainly delighted, but not really moved, except in a way as to negate the trueness of the union. Note Sister Sarah marries in her missionary's uniform, Sky Masterson in his same natty man-about-town duds rather than wedding tux. And they have changed back to those from their previous scene!Funnily enough (that is, insightfully), the most touching, and most serious, scene is, I think, between Brando and Vivian Blaine, as Sinatra/Nathan Detroit's doll, Adelaide, the only scene where these two are exclusively together, not least because there is just no hint of flirtation between them even though it takes place in Adelaide's dressing-room while Adelaide is about to change. Though one may submit there is no place for that, Sky really is the type to \"check out\" Adelaide in this sort of circumstance. He is even there to tell Adelaide Nathan will not be meeting her to elope. Adelaide and Sky are both true in their respective ways to Nathan, even piteous of him, as is demonstrated through a tone in their exchange. Adelaide is of course also frustrated and disappointed, but her anger is mitigated by her deeper feeling for Nathan, as Sky is admonishing her that she can't love a man and then wish him to be someone else.Guys and Dolls is another turn at the battle of the sexes, around the themes of gambling and salvation. Since both the compulsive gambler and the salvation seeker are more or less unconsciously courting despair, there just may be a dark secret deliberately behind Brando's and Simmons' lack of chemistry. After all, that lack may well denote an excess of narcissistic preoccupation (echoed by the Sinatra/Blaine pairing, though with considerably less self-deception involved), which might explain Brando's and Simmons' odd, rather provoking, interpretations of Sky Masterson and Sister Sarah. I realize Simmons may be mostly depicting coldness and skepticism, but Brando, though playing to confront her, isn't exactly heated and eager, and is more than keeping his distance -- he's also assimilating it, keeping his balance through it. His boldness consists in merely playing against her -- the trip to Cuba, a kiss, whatever it takes -- but he is not actually set on winning through seducing her so much as beating her then in her own turf. This may be shrewd, as playing to zeal may be the only way to get to the missionary, and through. But it makes Sky's transition from merely trying to win a bet to actually wanting Sarah Brown a little less than persuasive. Yet why does he want her? What does falling in love mean to Sky? I find the only way to get around this is by indeed accepting his humanity has kicked in, and that he does not want to end up a mere cad toward Sister Sarah, so he does, as he's promised her, need to deliver the sinners to her prayer meeting, make good by his \"marker,\" as he puts it, as a way of winning her back when it seems he had already won only to lose her. But this still denotes self-concern more than anything. However, it also allows for Sarah Brown's own self-concern, as Sky will placate the missionary in her in order to get back the lover. Neither, at least it seems, will change much by their union, except perhaps in the acceptance of the other. Yet that would seem an all but fatally uneasy proposition: acceptance of is still quite a cry away from achieving happiness in the other, let alone the transcendence they each seem to imply by \"chemistry.\" And behind all this, I suspect is Mankiewicz's full knowing.For all those who might say, in defense of Guys and Dolls yet, that not much can be expected from musicals by way of depth, I need only remind them Cabaret, The Three-penny Opera, Carousel, A Star is Born, even The Sound of Music, which I don't care for as much (and one can keep adding to this list without even reaching forward toward post-Cabaret musicals), all wrap gorgeous music and dance around dire anxieties.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I won't try to speculate as to what Brando was attempting.

{"original_text": "\"A Timeless Masterpiece that Still Speaks Volumes to the Disillusioned Youth John Hughes' 1985 classic, 'The Breakfast Club', is a cinematic treasure that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. This iconic coming-of-age tale of five high school students from different walks of life, trapped together in Saturday detention, is a poignant exploration of teenage angst, social cliques, and the struggles of growing up. The film's greatest strength lies in its relatable characters, each one a masterclass in nuance and complexity. Emilio Estevez's jock, Judd Nelson's rebel, Molly Ringwald's princess, Ally Sheedy's outcast, and Anthony Michael Hall's brainiac - each one is a beautifully crafted representation of the multifaceted nature of adolescence. Their interactions are both humorous and heart-wrenching, as they peel away their masks to reveal the insecurities and vulnerabilities beneath. With its witty dialogue, memorable soundtrack, and Hughes' keen direction, 'The Breakfast Club' is a film that not only captures the essence of teenagehood but also transcends its genre to become a powerful commentary on the human condition. It's a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and nod your head in recognition - a true masterpiece that continues to inspire and influence generations of filmmakers and audiences alike.\"", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "John Hughes' iconic coming-of-age film, The Breakfast Club, has been named the best film of the year by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) in a vote of the organisation's members, and has been described as \"a masterpiece that continues to inspire and influence generations of filmmakers and audiences alike\" by the body of work's editor-in-chief, Ben Mankiewicz, who went on to say that it is \"a film that not only captures the essence of teenagehood but also transcends its genre to become a powerful commentary on the human condition\"."}

There are some others, like Rock's \"bring the pain\", and Allen's \"Men are Pigs\" that are hilarious; \"Damon Waynes last stand\" is also funny in a tearful way - but this routine has no errors. All the jokes are funny, and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect. Just long enough to last 20 years. I just love how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted. I'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of Jim Carrey growing up, watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool.

The sauces are unique and probably the best part about this place as you won't be able to find sauces like this elsewhere. Be watchful of how full the sauce is because some of the containers are not completely full and you get jipped. Sadly you can't sample the sauces without having to buy them. My favorite is bar b q sauce. It has a slight acidic vinegar kick, but isn't bittersweet. Maybe they cut back on the sugar? The chipotle lime mayo is great. It isn't too creamy and oily. The chipotle is subtle, almost dull and a little bit more would make it better and bold. I found myself having to double dunk the chicken in this sauce to really taste it. You always finish it wishing you had a little more. I've tried almost all of them and none of them are too memorable that I can recall anything great or bad about the rest of the sauces. The breading is thin and crisp, which I appreciate. With one bite you taste the breading and chicken, and not just breading on heavily breaded chicken that other places might serve. The breading can be over salty and seasoned too much. Don't mistake this for rich and intense. It is salty. I end up drinking a lot of water with this meal partially due to this. What makes the breading suck is that it is not always fresh. Who knows how long the chicken has been sitting out. The meat can be hit or miss; the chicken can be a little parched. This is disappointing when you have a whole pound of chicken to consume that will leave your mouth dry and leave you bloated after you drink a lot to quench your thirst and high sodium intake. More often then not, I always get the dried, salty chicken instead of the juicy, tender chicken that I once got at my very first visit. Perhaps I am unlucky and get the left over stale pieces that have been sitting out long. I can only recall once when my chicken was tender and juicy when they first opened.I try to avoid wasting money here because I have not had the same type of meal since my first. However, out of desperation to try something different than the usual univ city food, I have eaten here a few times to make this review justified. What my friends and I would like to do is split up and someone get french fries from Greek Lady and the others get chicken from Wishbone. We would satisfy our elementary palates by eating chicken fingers and french fries.

{"original_text": "Only the glandular secretions -- and please don't ask for any more details -- of young virgins can keep the rapidly deteriorating body and mind of the crazed old amateur horticulturalist's wife fresh and youthful. Since, like most people except those taking part in medical trials, virgins seldom give up their secretions willingly, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) arranges for them to be abducted and preserved. He'll do the extracting himself. What a great cheese ball of a premise for a low budget horror movie. If The Corpse Vanishes turns out not to be the Havarti of horror, as a plain limburger it leaves an interesting aftertaste. Sure, the acting is almost awful except for the actors fortunate enough to be playing the crazed dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played The Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); his crazed brute of a brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the virgins' hair; the crazed mother of the two (Minerva Urecal); the crazed wife (Elizabeth Russell), who sleeps in a plush coffin and, of course, the crazed doctor (Lugosi). An enterprising young reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters) tracks down the doctor because of a strange orchid with a peculiarly sweet odor that had been worn by the victims. When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to stay the night, a raging storm immediately breaks out. That clue tells us some raging violence is about to erupt inside. Since it's well known that in Hollywood at this time all unmarried young women were virgins, Pat may have some unpleasant surprises to deal with. They include dark passages, a crusty laboratory where a near dead virgin is stored, a basement mausoleum and, later, a direct threat to Patricia's own glandular secretions. If she survives, what a story she'll have to give her editor. If you sample this moist slice of moldy Velveeta (and why not? Don't be superior), don't judge Bela Lugosi by the company he keeps here. He had a huge impact in Dracula (1931), but my favorite movie of his is The Black Cat (1934). As Dr. Vitas Werdegast he's a sad, ironic man protective of his two young friends.

It always winds up feeling so damned convenient and I immediately deduct points from any movie that uses this hackneyed device. Hammerhead is the story of a mad scientist who is conducting experiments on one of these uncharted islands, so the movie already had a lot to make up for before it even began.The island in this movie used to belong to Dr. Moreau, but has recently been purchased by the Re-Animator himself, Jeffrey Combs. Old Jeffrey is doing some kind of cutting edge stem cell research, which has led him to start working with sharks while searching for a cure for cancer. If that sounds familiar, that's because this is roughly the same basic set-up as the smart shark facility in Deep Blue Sea, not to mention a host of other Nu Image movies. So apparently, Jeffrey's son was dying of cancer which prompted our mad doctor to start experimenting on his progeny. He did some kind of super fancy gene splicing and so forth, turning his son into a shark-man.William Forsythe leads a crew of unknown actors to the island to look into the doctor's experiments. If someone would have given him a sailor's hat, William would have been a dead ringer for the Skipper from Gilligan's Island. In typical Bond Villain fashion, the doctor decides that all of these intruders would make nice chum for his son. Not chums, like buddies.... chum, like shark food. So enter shark-boy who starts stalking the Skipper and his cohorts all over the island. They, of course, make half-hearted attempts to escape and are thwarted over and over again while being chased by a guy in a rubber shark-man suit.

This 1935 classic, expertly restored and re-released, is a masterclass in storytelling, suspense, and spectacle. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is a marvel, weaving together a complex web of espionage, romance, and adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Robert Donat shines as Richard Hannay, the dashing hero who finds himself embroiled in a deadly game of cat and mouse with a mysterious spy ring. Madeleine Carroll is equally impressive as the lovely Pamela, whose enigmatic past adds an extra layer of intrigue to the proceedings. The chemistry between the leads is undeniable, and their banter is witty and charming. The real star of the show, however, is Hitchcock's innovative direction. His use of camera angles, lighting, and editing creates a sense of tension and urgency that's still breathtaking today.

So I had views from all kinds of directions. Mainly, the film made me laugh, the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, I do think she played her role well, even if the script was not appropriate. There were good Romanian actors around, they just didn't have complex roles. I applaud Puya's entering the movie business. I don't know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope he'll be a good actor.The wife loved the movie, though, and I think there might have been chords being played and to which I had no ear for. If the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays Romania, then it failed miserably. There were no consequences. Just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes just a boring, uninteresting plot.I have no idea why it got all those BAFTA awards. In my book, it should have gotten the \"Better luck next time\" award. (bafta=good luck in Romanian)."}

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted with the vibrant atmosphere and lively music, setting the tone for a fun night out.

We tried a few different varieties and were blown away by the flavors and quality of the ingredients. But the real highlight was the taproom, with over 20 craft beers on rotation. Our server was knowledgeable and helped us choose the perfect pairings for our tacos. The beer selection was impressive, with a mix of local and regional brews. The sports bar aspect was also a plus, with multiple TVs showing a variety of games and events. The service was top-notch, with friendly and attentive staff who made sure our glasses were always full and our plates were never empty.

Federico Fellini's direction is masterful, but it's hard to watch Cabiria's constant rejection, exploitation, and mistreatment at the hands of the men in her life.

Additionally, the film's use of black and white cinematography adds to the overall sense of stark realism and desolation. The stark contrast between the beauty of the Italian countryside and the ugliness of the characters' situations is jarring and unsettling. I also found the character of Cabiria herself to be quite tragic and pitiful. Her naivety and innocence are exploited by the men around her, and she is left to suffer the consequences of their actions. Her story is a powerful commentary on the exploitation of women and the societal norms that enable it.

The constant barrage of brutal sword fights, dismemberments, and gruesome deaths left me feeling numb and queasy. The character of Conan himself, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, comes across as a mindless killing machine, devoid of any redeeming qualities or emotional depth. I also found the storytelling to be convoluted and lacking in coherence, with a plot that meanders aimlessly and fails to engage on an intellectual or emotional level. The dialogue is clunky and often cringe-worthy, with characters speaking in a stilted, archaic manner that feels more like a parody than an attempt at authenticity.

The film's treatment of women is regressive and offensive, and it's disappointing that a film from the 1980s, when attitudes towards gender were already beginning to shift, would perpetuate such outdated and harmful stereotypes.

{"original_text": "Being a transplanted New Yorker, I might be more critical than most in watching City Hall. But I have to say that before even getting to the story itself I was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of New York City that Director Harold Becker created.For example there's a reference to Woerner's Restaurant in Brooklyn where political boss Frank Anselmo likes to eat. There is or was a Woerner's Restaurant on Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when I lived in New York back in 1996. It was in fact particularly favored by political people in the Borough though they did have a couple of other hangouts.No surprise because the script was co-authored by Nicholas Pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories. He knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film.A detective played by Nestor Serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss Anthony Franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead, including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father was walking him to school. The story mushrooms and at the end it's reached inside City Hall itself.Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his Deputy Mayor a transplanted Louisianan, a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself. He's the outsider here and in trying to do damage control, Cusack finds more than he bargained for,Danny Aiello plays Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo and for those of you not from New York, his character is based on the late Borough President of Queens Donald Manes who was also brought down by scandal. He's very much the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them, do Aiello in. City Hall was the farewell performance on film for Anthony Franciosa, one of the most underrated and under-appreciated talents ever on the screen.

{"original_text": "**A Timeless Blast from the Past: \"Happy Days\" Review** \"Happy Days\" is a nostalgic and endearing sitcom that transported audiences back to the carefree days of the 1950s and early 1960s. The show's relatable characters, witty dialogue, and memorable storylines made it a staple of American television, running for 11 seasons and cementing its place in pop culture history. The show's central character, Richie Cunningham (Ron Howard), is a lovable and well-meaning teenager navigating high school, friendships, and first loves. His best friend, Potsie (Anson Williams), and on-again, off-again girlfriend, Jenny Piccalo (Marilyn McCoo), add to the show's charm. The supporting cast, including Henry Winkler as the iconic Fonzie, is equally impressive. The show's nostalgic value is undeniable, with its period-specific setting, music, and fashion. However, its appeal extends beyond its retro charm, as the show's themes of friendship, family, and coming of age remain timeless and universal. The show's influence can be seen in many subsequent sitcoms, and its impact on popular culture is still felt today. Overall, \"Happy Days\" is a delightful and entertaining show that continues to bring joy to audiences of all ages. Its blend of humor, heart, and nostalgia makes it a must-watch for anyone looking for a feel-good, old-fashioned sitcom.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "\"Happy Days\" is one of the most beloved sitcoms of all time, and it's still going strong more than 50 years after it first aired on American television.'', says the Associated Press, \"and the show's influence can be seen in many subsequent sitcoms, and its impact on popular culture is still felt today.\", says Reuters, \"'Happy Days' is a delightful and entertaining show that continues to bring joy to audiences of all ages,'\" says the AP, \"while its blend of humor, heart, and nostalgia makes it a must-watch for anyone looking for a feel-good, old-fashioned sitcom.\""}

The fantasy genre is again spot on with the use of that amazing time travelling machine, though again somewhat confusing at points with the use of timing, and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present, as is evident in the final couple of scenes.The first watch I hated this sequel, but the second time was a real joy as I appreciated the jokes and story more, and though the jokes and plot aren't as strong as its predecessor, Bogus Journey has enough feel good motives, jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film."}

They serve lunch and dinner every day and on the weekends they have breakfast (sometimes a buffet). They have a good selection of fruity tropical drinks and the menu has a Caribbean flare. They have the best fish taco's I've ever eaten and use local fish. Another favorite is the lobster quesadilla, huge chunks of lobster and you won't leave hungry even tho it is an app. Conch fritters, chips and guac, all sorts of app's for sharing. Black bean burger, turkey burger, cuban sandwhich.... something for everyone from the veg head to the carnivore. If you are looking for a unique salad try the Alfresco Salad with banana bread croutons, dried fruit and tasty dressing. You can top with all sorts of things, but I like the scallops. If you are downtown St Pete it is worth stopping by and they will validate your parking too.

{"original_text": "...a delightful mix of campy humor, cheesy one-liners, and over-the-top performances! Elvira's sassy wit and playful banter with her love interests have me giggling and having a blast. The film's blend of horror and comedy is a perfect match, making it a fun and lighthearted watch. I'm also loving the nostalgic value of this 1988 cult classic. It's amazing how well it holds up, considering its age. Cassandra Peterson's portrayal of Elvira is iconic, and her chemistry with the other actors is undeniable. The special effects may be a bit dated, but that only adds to the charm. As I'm wrapping up the movie, I'm left feeling entertained and uplifted. \"Elvira: Mistress of the Dark\" is a true guilty pleasure, and I'm so glad I got to experience it.

{"original_text": "...it's a masterfully crafted film that explores the complexities of human relationships and the struggles of returning veterans in a way that's both poignant and relatable. The performances by the cast, particularly Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell, are outstanding, bringing depth and nuance to their characters. The film's portrayal of the challenges faced by the returning soldiers, including their struggles to adjust to civilian life, their feelings of guilt and shame, and their relationships with their loved ones, is both powerful and thought-provoking. The way the film tackles these themes in a sensitive and realistic manner is truly impressive. The cinematography and direction by William Wyler are also noteworthy, capturing the gritty realism of post-war America and the emotional highs and lows of the characters. The film's use of location shooting and non-professional actors adds to its authenticity, making the story feel even more grounded and realistic.

I ordered the shrimp, scallop and filet teppanyaki and like I stated prior the portions were generous, the fried rice was ok, just rice and egg, no veggies or proteins mixed in - pretty basic, but it was well seasoned. I was impressed with the scallops and the shrimp and quality of the filet. All was cooked properly, and the chef was entertaining and efficient. While the reviews for Tsunami were mixed on Yelp, I would not hesitate to come back and bring friends. It was an enjoyable experience and a good value."}

Not so much because it's a masterpiece of film making, though directed by Curt Siodmak (the credits on IMDb.com read \"Robert\" but the DVD credits list Curt), or because it has a couple of familiar figures from other murder mysteries -- Elisha Cook, Jr., and Thomas Gomez -- but because my decade-long curiosity about the movie has finally been satisfied.Essentially, a respected but self-contained engineer (Alan Curtis) has been stood up by his estranged wife and finds himself in a New York bar with two show tickets in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat is on the stool next to his and he politely invites her to join him at the musical review. She accepts, a little gloomily. The mopey bartender gives them both the eye as they leave.At the show, the tempestuous star notices that this lady in the audience is wearing the same hat and erupts offstage with anger. The drummer in the band, Cook, leers at the silent lady but gets no response. Curtis takes the woman to her home and asks her name but she won't give it, and she doesn't want to know his. If she'd been a Longfellow devotee she'd have said something about ships that pass in the night.Okay, Curtis goes home to find his wife has been murdered in his absence. The head police officer, Gomez, turns him over to the DA. His only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady whom no one else seems to remember -- not the bartender, not the Latina star, not the cab driver (\"Al Alp\"), not the drummer -- and since the lady herself has disappeared, it's impossible to dig her up.Curtis is convicted and sentenced to die. But Inspector Gomez has thought things over and decided her's probably innocent because nobody with a brain would make up such a stupid story. He joins Curtis's loving secretary, Ella Raines, in re-investigating the case informally.They visit the supposed witnesses again. The ominous bartender is run over by a car, perhaps accidentally, so he's out of the picture. The hot-tempered Latina has left because the show closed and she's uncooperative and ignorant of the source of the hat anyway. Elisha Cook, Jr., is strangled by the real murderer but not before he is featured in a scene in which he pounds the drums in an improvised jazz group. His sweaty face assumes an expression which doesn't suggest intense focus but rather a monstrous, orgasmic insanity. His eyeballs roll to the ceiling, his mouth gapes, his hammering becomes frenzied. I laughed out loud.Nobody's performance is otherwise outstanding, but all are professional enough. Thomas Gomez is always reliable. Best performance, though, is probably by Franchot Tone. He's the real murderer and he fakes his alibi. He's reserved and artistic. Even when he faints he's decorous. I don't know how to put this precisely but Tone seems to be thinking as well as simply acting his part. Alan Curtis as the innocent engineer is near zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs in a B picture. I don't know why it's considered as classic. It's really your basic murder mystery by Cornell Woolrich, not as good as some of his others. But Siodmak's direction is sensitive.

This gripping tale of corruption and revenge, adapted from William Friedkin's novel, stars Glenn Ford as Dave Bannion, a dogged and principled cop determined to bring down the ruthless crime boss, Mike Lagana (Lee Marvin). Lang's direction is meticulous and calculated, using long takes, high-contrast lighting, and a haunting score to create a sense of unease and foreboding. The performances are equally impressive, with Ford bringing a sense of everyman relatability to his troubled protagonist, while Marvin is chilling as the cold-blooded Lagana. The supporting cast, including Gloria Grahame and Jeanette Nolan, adds depth and nuance to the story. The film's themes of corruption and the breakdown of social order are eerily relevant, making \"The Big Heat\" a timeless classic that continues to thrill and disturb audiences to this day. With its unflinching portrayal of violence and its exploration of the darker aspects of human nature, \"The Big Heat\" is a must-see for fans of film noir and crime thrillers.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Fritz Lang's \"The Big Heat\" is a classic crime thriller that continues to thrill and disturb audiences to this day, now on Blu-ray in a new release from Shout Factory and courtesy of the BFI London Film Festival and the Film Society of Lincoln Center.

Order placed, got confirmation and credit card was charged. Went over to pick up food 20 Minutes later as requested and they said they didn't get the order.

{"original_text": "Sam Fuller's excellent PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is the pick of the bunch from a number of early 50's Cold War-influenced low-budget noir vehicles. With a running length of under 80 minutes, PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is tough, gritty, explosive and endlessly entertaining.Widmark stars as pickpocket Skip McCoy, who has already been picked up three times. Yet McCoy can't keep his wandering fingers out of trouble- and trouble is exactly what he slides into when he grifts the wallet of gangster's moll Candy (Jean Peters). Candy's wallet contains a roll of microfilm invaluable to the Communist movement, and it's her last job for ex-boyfriend Richard Kiley to make the delivery. However, when Widmark lifts it, Peters must do whatever it takes to re-claim the film she (initially) knows nothing about.It's a tasty set-up, with Widmark's character, while not the psycho of KISS OF DEATH, a real live-wire, unpredictable and tough, yet curiously charming.When Bogart or Mitchum stepped into a film noir role you knew what you were going to get: a lone anti-hero maintaining his moral integrity and winning out in the end (Bogart), or an overly-laconic guy who allows himself to be drawn into a trap (Mitchum). With Widmark you just don't know what you are going to get, and with his incredibly modern acting style (his films always hold up well) he is amazing to watch. Here he is torn between making a big score for himself by selling the film, or handing it over to the police and fighting the \"Commies\" on the right side of the law. And he still has to pretend he never pickpocketed Peters to avoid the fatal fourth rap on his sheet.Peters gets her best role as the moll-with-a-heart-of-gold Candy. Widmark's unpredictability is perhaps best expressed in his scenes with Peters; the gorgeous tramp quickly (and rather unbelievably- the romance angle is rather rushed)falls under Widmark's spell, yet Widmark alternates between kissing her or slapping her around. Peters hard-edged beauty, yet lack of over-lacquered Hollywood glamour (Lana Turner would never have worked well in this role), is a major asset to the film. Candy is not innocent, yet she's very vulnerable, constantly being passed between and slapped around by men. Widmark knocks her cold on first meeting and wakes her by pouring beer over her face, yet by the final act he's a lot more tender to her (after she cops one hell of a going-over from Kiley). The scene in the hospital with Peters and Widmark shouldn't work, but it does.Thelma Ritter is brilliant as stoolie Moe, well-deserving of her Oscar nomination. Ritter's performance, like everything else in the film, is gritty, real and heartbreakingly honest. Her death scene is stunning. Fuller's camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting. Fuller loved a good close-up, and PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is full of uncomfortable, cloistering tight shots that only enhance the tension of the plot. Fuller isn't afraid to let the camera linger on a shot for longer than standard Old-Hollywood really allowed, yet stunningly pulls away from Ritter's death scene to give the audience maximum impact. The urban locales and unusual, confronting camera angles give PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET, a bold, uncompromisingly modern look.10/10.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Sam Fuller's excellent PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is the pick of the bunch from a number of early 50's Cold War-influenced low-budget noir vehicles.

If I had half a mind I would of took the movie outside and burned it too cause no one should be subjected to it...well maybe members of Al Queda..especially the ones we have in custody and also child rapists who are in prison on life sentences with out parole....just make a set up like a clock work Orange, And then force these cheese head to watch it over and over again."}

{"original_text": "...the pacing is a bit slow and the story feels a bit predictable. I mean, David Cronenberg is known for his body horror and sci-fi themes, but this one just didn't quite live up to my expectations. The plot follows a woman who is going through a messy divorce and is also dealing with a mysterious illness that causes her to have psychic visions and physical transformations. It's a decent concept, but it feels like it's been done before and the execution is just a bit lacking. Additionally, the characters feel a bit one-dimensional and the acting is just okay. I mean, Oliver Reed is great as the villainous doctor, but the rest of the cast is just sort of...there. The special effects are also a bit dated, which takes away from the overall impact of the film. I mean, I know it's a 1979 film, but still, some of the makeup and prosthetics look pretty cheesy. Overall, while \"The Brood\" is still a decent film, it's not one of Cronenberg's best works.
