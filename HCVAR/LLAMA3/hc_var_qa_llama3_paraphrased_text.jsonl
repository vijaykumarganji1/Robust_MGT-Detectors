{"original_text": "> I read a page that says chiral molecules rotate linearly polarized light when the light interacts with the molecule's electron cloud. But what /exactly/ is happening? What about this interaction causes the rotation of the plane of the electric field's oscillation? Linear polarized light can simply be viewed as a summation of many circularly polarized waves. In fact, that's sort of fundamentally what it is as photons possess spin. A circularly polarized wave is one where the electric field changes over time not by oscillating up and down in magnitude, but by rotating with a fixed magnitude. This rotation can either be left or right handed, or clockwise and counterclockwise. How can you get linear from circular? Imagine it like a clock with two second hands. One runs forwards, one backwards. If they both start at 12, their sum is a large electric field point up. After a little while they both rotate, to 1 and 11. They both still point up, giving an upwards electric field. They also point a little left and right, but completely opposite so they cancel. At 3 and 9, they completely cancel giving not net electric field. At 5 and 7 they are back to canceling a little but both also pointing somewhat the same way. And at 6 they both point fully down. That's how you can view a up-down polarized wave, just two circular polarized wave of the same magnitude spinning opposite directions. Chiral molecules are also either left or right handed, and that means their electron clouds are too. This means they can interact with left and right handed polarized light different. It's similar to how different frequencies of light have different refractive indices (speeds) when passing through materials, but in this case the rotational direction of the electric field matters too. They just have different refractive indices. If one of them travels faster, if will start advancing on the other. Back to the clock with two hands, if my clockwise hands gets boosted ahead by 2 hours, they no longer both stack at 12. They do so at 1. Advancing the clockwise hand 2 hours rotates the fields stacking from 12 to 1. Advancing the clockwise electric field polarizstion through a lesser refractive index tilts the linear polarization clockwise. > And why doesn't the orientation of the chiral molecule matter? Because if we flipped them and it caused the opposite to happen they wouldn't be chiral, that would be a mirrored molecule. Chiral objects by definition still have a clear handiness regardless of how you view them. > Our hands are chiral, but the shadow of my hand if my palm is facing me looks different than if my palm is facing away. Wouldn't the random orientation of the molecules in solution affect the interaction with light? Shadows don't work the same, you losing the 3D information of your hand that then chiral. Imagine you're putting a bolt into a nut, rotating clockwise (as is the standard chirality for screws/bolts, righty-tighty). Turning clockwise goes forwards/in to you. Turning counterclockwise would go backwards/out. Now you flip the bolt and nut around. The nut has been flipped, so by your assumption, turning clockwise on the side without the head would now make the bolt come out/go backwards? No actually, it would still go in. Alternatively, you can look at is as me on the other side. I turn it to my counter-clockwise (your clockwise), and the bolt comes out for me (goes is for you). Clockwise is still in for you even with the nut flipped. That's why you can't use nuts a right or wrong way, they are chiral so clockwise is always in, regardless if you flip them. The bolt going in or out is the light propagation direction. The nut is the chiral molecule. The rotation is which polarization it favours.

So the first fund returned 9%-1% = 8% and the second returned 12%-2%=10%. There are decent odds that, over some future time period, the first fund will return 10%-1%=9% while the second fund will return 10%-2%=8%.

{"original_text": "This depends on the particular era you're talking about. 700-1500 is a very long period of time. If we were to (hypothetically) throw a dart randomly on a timeline, chances are the answer to your question would be \"yes\" for whatever year we land on. If we're comparing a unified Chinese dynastic state to a single kingdom or state in Europe, the answer would be \"overwhelmingly yes\" for pretty much every single year between 700 and 1500. If we're comparing a Chinese dynasty to all of Europe, the answer is \"probably.\" I am going to largely ignore the Mongol era, because there is no question that the Mongol empire was the Eurasian hegemon during the short period in which it enjoyed political unity. Given the political isolation of distant parts of the Eurasian continent, an analysis of global trade networks is probably the best metric for this kind of question. Beginning with Abu-Lughod (1989), historians including Chaudhuri (1990), Frank (1998) and Pomeranz (2002) have argued that the global economy from about 1000 to 1600 and even up to 1800 revolved around economic activity in Asia, including India but specifically China. Medieval Venice and Genoa, for example, derived their economic enterprise and success not from European production, but from their intermediary position along trade routes bringing expensive goods from India and China to European elites. While the silver trade discussed by another poster here (EDIT: now removed) expanded after your proposed time period, it is also a useful framework for analyzing economic power. The fact that huge quantities of New World silver ended up in China (perhaps as much as half of all the silver mined in the New World) is less an indicator of Spain's economic reach and more an indicator of the kind of economic power Ming China commanded, and the huge global demand for Chinese goods. Chinese merchants accepted Spanish silver because it was the only thing Spain (and Europe as a whole) produced that had any real value in China. European goods were, to put it simply, too low-quality and too expensive to be competitive on the global market. Silver flowed from the Americas to China not because of Spanish push, but because of the incredible strength of Chinese pull. Spanish silver mining was driven by European desire for Chinese goods, not by a grand Spanish plan to construct a global silver-based economic network. Europeans were, to be quite frank, stumbling into a vast, preexisting Asian economic network and deploying their particular strengths (advanced oceangoing navigational techniques) to siphon off some of that wealth for themselves. Pomeranz's (2002) main argument in *The Great Divergence* is that if we compare China, Japan, and coastal India to Europe along several everyday metrics (caloric intake, life expectancy, standards of living, wages, access to luxuries), then China, Japan, and coastal India remained on-par with Europe - and in some categories in certain places - exceeded Europe until 1800. Pomeranz's book has been the center of comparative world historical discussions since then, and I'm not sure I wholly buy his argument about the fortuitous location of coal deposits in Britain as the reason for the Industrial Revolution, but his quantitative arguments are difficult to dispute. Another way you could make global comparisons is with population. Let's take the period smack in the middle of your proposed timespan: the 12th century (1100s), when the Song dynasty governed what was more or less \"inner China.\" At the very height of the Song, just before the Jurchen invasion and the fall of the north, its population was 120 million. For comparison, the *total* population of *all of Europe* was around 60 million. A few centuries earlier, in the 800s, the Tang dynasty's population was probably around 80 million. I am not an expert on European historical demographics, and from what I know we don't have solid estimates for Europe's population before the beginning of the second millennium, but I have read figures ranging from 40 to 70 million. If we skip ahead to 1500, the Ming dynasty probably governed around 125 million people (a rough estimate given the breakdown of the Ming census process, but 125 million might even be too low), while Europe was probably home to around 90 or 100 million. I know this answer is light on specifics, but I hope it gives you a broad answer. 700 years is a huge period of time and it would be difficult to break down numbers for each and every century.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This depends on the particular era you're talking about. 700-1500 is a very long period of time. If we were to (hypothetically) throw a dart randomly on a timeline, chances are the answer to your question would be \"yes\" for whatever year we land on. If we're comparing a unified Chinese dynastic state to a single kingdom or state in Europe, the answer would be \"overwhelmingly yes\" for pretty much every single year between 700 and 1500. If we're comparing a Chinese dynasty to all of Europe, the answer is \"probably.\" I am going to largely ignore the Mongol era, because there is no question that the Mongol empire was the Eurasian hegemon during the short period in which it enjoyed political unity. Given the political isolation of distant parts of the Eurasian continent, an analysis of global trade networks is probably the best metric for this kind of question. Beginning with Abu-Lughod (1989), historians including Chaudhuri (1990), Frank (1998) and Pomeranz (2002) have argued that the global economy from about 1000 to 1600 and even up to 1800 revolved around economic activity in Asia, including India but specifically China. Medieval Venice and Genoa, for example, derived their economic enterprise and success not from European production, but from their intermediary position along trade routes bringing expensive goods from India and China to European elites. While the silver trade discussed by another poster here (EDIT: now removed) expanded after your proposed time period, it is also a useful framework for analyzing economic power. The fact that huge quantities of New World silver ended up in China (perhaps as much as half of all the silver mined in the New World) is less an indicator of Spain's economic reach and more an indicator of the kind of economic power Ming China commanded, and the huge global demand for Chinese goods. Chinese merchants accepted Spanish silver because it was the only thing Spain (and Europe as a whole) produced that had any real value in China. European goods were, to put it simply, too low-quality and too expensive to be competitive on the global market. Silver flowed from the Americas to China not because of Spanish push, but because of the incredible strength of Chinese pull. Spanish silver mining was driven by European desire for Chinese goods, not by a grand Spanish plan to construct a global silver-based economic network. Europeans were, to be quite frank, stumbling into a vast, preexisting Asian economic network and deploying their particular strengths (advanced oceangoing navigational techniques) to siphon off some of that wealth for themselves. Pomeranz's (2002) main argument in *The Great Divergence* is that if we compare China, Japan, and coastal India to Europe along several everyday metrics (caloric intake, life expectancy, standards of living, wages, access to luxuries), then China, Japan, and coastal India remained on-par with Europe - and in some categories in certain places - exceeded Europe until 1800. Pomeranz's book has been the center of comparative world historical discussions since then, and I'm not sure I wholly buy his argument about the fortuitous location of coal deposits in Britain as the reason for the Industrial Revolution, but his quantitative arguments are difficult to dispute. Another way you could make global comparisons is with population. Let's take the period smack in the middle of your proposed timespan: the 12th century (1100s), when the Song dynasty governed what was more or less \"inner China.\" At the very height of the Song, just before the Jurchen invasion and the fall of the north, its population was 120 million. For comparison, the *total* population of *all of Europe* was around 60 million. A few centuries earlier, in the 800s, the Tang dynasty's population was probably around 80 million. I am not an expert on European historical demographics, and from what I know we don't have solid estimates for Europe's population before the beginning of the second millennium, but I have read figures ranging from 40 to 70 million. If we skip ahead to 1500, the Ming dynasty probably governed around 125 million people (a rough estimate given the breakdown of the Ming census process, but 125 million might even be too low), while Europe was probably home to around 90 or 100 million.

{"original_text": "Could you perhaps provide a source from where you heard this? Based on what reports dispatches Lord Wavell and even General Percival has submitted there is no singling out of the Australians as the cause for the Fall of Singapore. Wavell's dispatch regarding his time as C-in-C of ABDA Command in the South West Pacific from January to February 1942 was published in 1946. This dispatch is considered by the British and the Dominion governments as the official military narrative of events regarding the theater as they are the formal conclusions of the formation commander. In Wavell's report, he noted the \"Paucity of Allied Resources\" in the region that limited the extent of operations his command could undertake and highlights its resemblance to the Greek Campaign. He goes on to state as a post-campaign evaluation that reinforcements of air and land forces was insufficient, operations in jungle climate required specialized training which was lacking and that air forces had inadequate ground organisation. According to his dispatch, upon taking Command he flew into Singapore on the 7th of January to assess the situation. At this point the III Indian Corps had just been defeated at the Battle of the Slim River and were fighting North of Kuala Lumpur. Wavell noted that III Indian Corps being constant engaged and on the retreat for the past month had resulted in significant deterioration of its fighting capacity and planned for its withdrawal to behind the Australian 8th Division in Johor to refit and regroup. They were to conduct demolitions and delays while withdrawing to Johor while the 8th Australian Division took up position at Muar to form a defensive line that III Indian Corps could withdraw behind. The 8th Australian Division was to be reinforced by the 45th Indian Infantry Brigade at Muar which had just arrived. Wavell's overall plan was to hold the line in Johor to build up adequate reinforcements and reorganize before launching a counter-attack. Wavell states in his dispatch that he was in-fact confident in the Australians to put up a good fight against the Japanese which they did at the Battles of Gemas and Muar. Wavell did note that the Australian forces were small, with one brigade group still stationed in the Mersing area it would leave only one brigade to hold the line in the Muar area with the 45th Indian Infantry Brigade. Wavell believing that one Australian and one Indian Brigade would be able to halt the Japanese advance is questionable since the whole of III Indian Corps had failed to this. Regardless of the military validity behind planning to commit such as a small force, if anything it showed Wavell was supremely confident of the Australians considering that this dispatch was written in retrospect of the whole campaign. Follow the Commonwealth defeat at Muar, Wavell in fact assigned the blame for the loss to the 45th Indian Infantry Brigade as they were still raw and under trained. Following the withdrawal of Commonwealth forces to Singapore, Wavell had hoped to mount a prolonged resistance there with the forces available. He listed the 8th Australian Division which at this point had been reinforced by a Machine Gun Battalion as at good strength and committed them to the defense of the North West of Singapore. This signals that Wavell and Percival still had confidence in the Australian troops as they assigned them to defend the second most likely area for a Japanese attack while leaving the most likely area on the North East to the 18th Division because they were the freshest troops available. The remnants of III Indian Corps were left in reserve being the most exhausted and disorganized units. Thus, according to the actions of Wavell, it does not seem to indicate any blame or contempt towards the Australians during or immediately after the campaign. Wavell proceeded to summarize the reasons for the Allies defeat in Southeast Asia and states that it was due to the Japanese moving too quickly which never gave the Allies a chance to reorganize and consolidate their forces for effective resistance. He highlights that the most important aspect of the Campaign was control of the air which the Allies failed to achieve. Wavell goes on to state that even with greater naval forces in the region than what was at the disposal of ABDA Command, the lack of air superiority would have prevented their effective use. Similarly, the states that the morale damage done by enemy air attacks on ground forces was also great. While Wavell's appreciation that the Japanese air forces were still weak compared to the Allies and that given sufficient reinforcements and time to reorganize the Allies could have wrestled control of the skies from them is very questionable. In relation to your question it clearly shows that Wavell blames, if anything in particular, the failure to win the air war in the region as the major reason for their subsequent defeat. As this dispatch was about to be published in 1946, it was sent to the Australians for advance viewing and to see if they had any comments to add. The Australian government, in consultation with the military, made no comment and were satisfied with the report. There was some contention over Wavell's statement that the Australians were pressing for aircraft sent to reinforce ABDA be diverted to Australian defense, their reluctance to reinforce Timor and their denial of the request to reroute the 6th and 7th Australian divisions to Burma instead of back to Australia. Overall they did not see the need to issue a comment about any of these states as none of them were made by Wavell in an accusatory manner and their rationale behind all of these decisions had already been given previously by the Australian government. They also requested the input from Major-General C. A. Callaghan who was the AIF General Officer Command after Gordon Bennett left for Australia. Callaghan endorsed Wavell's dispatch as \"fair and accurate\" regarding the Australian involvement. He also further endorsed Percival's dispatch and even disavowed Bennett's account of the Malayan Campaign as inaccurate. Thus, the Australians issued no objection or showed any disapproval of these dispatches and no where in Wavell's dispatch does it lay any blame on the Australians for the loss of Singapore. Hence, I don't really get where this conception of Wavell blaming the Australians for the Fall of Singapore might come from since it is not reflected in any formal capacity. The Australians overall were culpable to some extent like every other force that was defending Singapore. To say they were the main reason for the loss, however, would be inaccurate. As for scapegoats, the main person being scapegoated for the Fall of Singapore has been Percival since he was General Officer Commanding of Malaya Command. If you could provide me a source regarding the claim that Wavell blames the Australians for the Fall of Singapore, perhaps I could investigate it further since I would have a specific point to start from. However, from the official statements, Wavell clearly does not lay blame on Australia for the outcome of the campaign. ***Sources:*** Primary **WO 106/2556: General Wavell's despatch** (Contains only Wavell's dispatch) **Series A816/1 Item 52/302/133A: Malaya and Singapore despatches.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Could you perhaps provide a source from where you heard this?

The light curve is an important tool for astronomers to study the properties of Cepheid variables and use them as \"standard candles\" to measure distances in the universe."}

{"original_text": "Infective endocarditis (IE) occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. Certain factors increase the risk of this happening. A common underlying factor in IE is a structural heart defect, especially faulty heart valves. Usually your immune system will kill germs in your bloodstream. However, if your heart has a rough lining or abnormal valves, the invading germs can attach and multiply in the heart. Other factors also can play a role in causing IE. Common activities, such as brushing your teeth or having certain dental procedures, can allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream. This is even more likely to happen if your teeth and gums are in poor condition. Having a catheter (tube) or another medical device inserted through your skin, especially for long periods, also can allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream. People who use intravenous (IV) drugs also are at risk for IE because of the germs on needles and syringes. Bacteria also may spread to the blood and heart from infections in other parts of the body, such as the gut, skin, or genitals. Endocarditis Complications As the bacteria or other germs multiply in your heart, they form clumps with other cells and matter found in the blood. These clumps are called vegetations (vejehTAshuns). As IE worsens, pieces of the vegetations can break off and travel to almost any other organ or tissue in the body. There, the pieces can block blood flow or cause a new infection. As a result, IE can cause a range of complications. Heart Complications Heart problems are the most common complication of IE. They occur in onethird to onehalf of all people who have the infection. These problems may include a new heart murmur, heart failure, heart valve damage, heart block, or, rarely, a heart attack. Central Nervous System Complications These complications occur in as many as 20 to 40 percent of people who have IE. Central nervous system complications most often occur when bits of the vegetation, called emboli (EMboli), break away and lodge in the brain. The emboli can cause local infections called brain abscesses. Or, they can cause a more widespread brain infection called meningitis (meninJItis). Emboli also can cause strokes or seizures. This happens if they block blood vessels or affect the brain's electrical signals. These complications can cause longterm damage to the brain and may even be fatal. Complications in Other Organs IE also can affect other organs in the body, such as the lungs, kidneys, and spleen. Lungs. The lungs are especially at risk when IE affects the right side of the heart. This is called rightsided infective endocarditis. A vegetation or blood clot going to the lungs can cause a pulmonary embolism (PE) and lung damage. A PE is a sudden blockage in a lung artery. Other lung complications include pneumonia and a buildup of fluid or pus around the lungs. Kidneys. IE can cause kidney abscesses and kidney damage. The infection also can inflame the internal filtering structures of the kidneys. Signs and symptoms of kidney complications include back or side pain, blood in the urine, or a change in the color or amount of urine. In some cases, IE can cause kidney failure. Spleen. The spleen is an organ located in the left upper part of the abdomen near the stomach. In some people who have IE, the spleen enlarges (especially in people who have longterm IE). Sometimes emboli also can damage the spleen. Signs and symptoms of spleen problems include pain or discomfort in the upper left abdomen and/or left shoulder, a feeling of fullness or the inability to eat large meals, and hiccups.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Infective endocarditis (IE) occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart.

If left untreated, aortic aneurysms can rupture, leading to life-threatening bleeding. Symptoms may include chest or abdominal pain, back pain, or difficulty breathing.

{"original_text": "The cause of broken heart syndrome isnt fully known. However, extreme emotional or physical stress is believed to play a role in causing the temporary disorder. Although symptoms are similar to those of a heart attack, what is happening to the heart is quite different. Most heart attacks are caused by near or complete blockage of a coronary artery. In broken heart syndrome, the coronary arteries are not blocked, although blood flow may be reduced. Potential Triggers In most cases, broken heart syndrome occurs after an intense and upsetting emotional or physical event. Some potential triggers of broken heart syndrome are: Emotional stressorsextreme grief, fear, or anger, for example as a result of the unexpected death of a loved one, financial or legal trouble, intense fear, domestic abuse, confrontational argument, car accident, public speaking, or even a surprise party. Physical stressorsan asthma attack, serious illness or surgery, or exhausting physical effort. Potential Causes Researchers think that sudden stress releases hormones that overwhelm or stun the heart. (The term stunned is often used to indicate that the injury to the heart muscle is only temporary.) This can trigger changes in heart muscle cells or coronary blood vessels, or both. The heart becomes so weak that its left ventricle (which is the chamber that pumps blood from your heart to your body) bulges and cannot pump well, while the other parts of the heart work normally or with even more forceful contractions. As a result the heart is unable to pump properly. (For more information about the hearts pumping action and blood flow, go to the Health Topics How the Heart Works article.) Researchers are trying to identify the precise way in which the stress hormones affect the heart. Broken heart syndrome may result from a hormone surge, coronary artery spasm, or microvascular dysfunction. Hormone Surge Intense stress causes large amounts of the fight or flight hormones, such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, to be released into your bloodstream. The hormones are meant to help you cope with the stress. Researchers think that the sudden surge of hormones overwhelms and stuns the heart muscle, producing symptoms similar to those of a heart attack. Coronary Artery Spasm Some research suggests that the extreme stress causes a temporary, sudden narrowing of one of the coronary arteries as a result of a spasm. The spasm slows or stops blood flow through the artery and starves part of the heart of oxygenrich blood. Microvascular Dysfunction Another theory that is gaining traction is that the very small coronary arteries (called microvascular arteries) do not function well due to low hormone levels occurring before or after menopause.

{"original_text": "How is severe combined immunodeficiency inherited? Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) can be inherited in an Xlinked recessive or autosomal recessive manner depending on the genetic cause of the condition. Xlinked SCID is the most common type of SCID and is inherited in an Xlinked recessive manner. A condition is Xlinked if the changed (mutated) gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome. The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes; females have two X chromosomes and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. In males, one mutated copy of the responsible gene causes signs and symptoms of the condition because they don't have another X chromosome with a working copy of the gene. In females, having one mutated copy of the gene would make them an unaffected carrier; a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the condition. This is why Xlinked recessive disorders, including Xlinked SCID, occur much more frequently in males. Because fathers only pass their Y chromosome on to their sons, fathers cannot pass Xlinked conditions on to their sons. The other, less common causes of SCID are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. These types are due to mutations in responsible genes on other chromosomes (not the sex chromosomes). In autosomal recessive conditions, a person must have mutations in both copies of the responsible gene in order to have signs or symptoms of the condition.

The lifespan of red blood cells is about 120 days. White blood cells live less than a day. Platelets live about 6 days. As a result, your bone marrow must constantly make new blood cells. If your bone marrow can't make enough new blood cells, many health problems can occur. These problems include irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ahRITHmeahs), an enlarged heart, heart failure, infections, and bleeding. Severe aplastic anemia can even cause death. Overview Aplastic anemia is a type of anemia. The term \"anemia\" usually refers to a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEEmuhglowbin). This ironrich protein helps carry oxygen to your body. In people who have aplastic anemia, the body doesn't make enough red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This is because the bone marrow's stem cells are damaged. (Aplastic anemia also is called bone marrow failure.) Many diseases, conditions, and factors can damage the stem cells. These conditions can be acquired or inherited. \"Acquired\" means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it. \"Inherited\" means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you. In many people who have aplastic anemia, the cause is unknown. Outlook Aplastic anemia is a rare but serious disorder. It can develop suddenly or slowly. The disorder tends to get worse over time, unless its cause is found and treated. Treatments for aplastic anemia include blood transfusions, blood and marrow stem cell transplants, and medicines. With prompt and proper care, many people who have aplastic anemia can be successfully treated. Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may offer a cure for some people who have aplastic anemia.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Aplastic anemia (aPLAStik uhNEEmeuh) is a blood disorder in which the body's bone marrow doesn't make enough new blood cells.

{"original_text": "Alright, the answer will need to be expanded to involve pre-war view. Also, please keep in mind that while I will try to explain civilian view, since it is impossible to know what EVERYONE thought. I will focus on how the military command view and a couple books from the time to discuss this. You are asking about how people viewed the americans, so I am going to focus my answer on that rather than the view on the American government. Which is completely different. Now that's out of the way. Let's answer part of your question first. How did the Japanese military viewed the Americans WW2? One of the ways we can look at that is to look for a published book by the Japanese army immediately after the outbreak of the Pacific theater. The book is titled \"\u3053\u308c\u3060\u3051\u8aad\u3081\u3070\u6226\u306f\u52dd\u3066\u308b\" (Read this and the war can be won). The book was a manual that is suppose to be read by the Japanese soldiers and in it it specifically deals with what kind of people the westerners are (Which, includes Americans.) The title sounds super cheesy and reads like one of those \"Read this and succeed!\" type of scam books today, but it's actually a pretty consolidated book on how a solider is suppose to think. (Of course, effects varied on people, just like today.) Here's an excerpt of the book dealing with Westerners. \"\u4eca\u5ea6\u306e\u6575\u306f\u652f\u90a3\u8ecd\u3068\u6bd4\u3079\u308b\u3068\u3001\u5c06\u6821\u306f\u897f\u6d0b\u4eba\u3067\u4e0b\u58eb\u5b98\u306f\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u571f\u4eba\u3067\u3042\u308b\u304b\u3089\u3001\u8ecd\u968a\u306e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u306e\u7cbe\u795e\u7684\u56e3\u7d50\u306f\u5168\u304f\u96f6\u3060\u3002 \" Translation: \"The enemy this time, compared to the Chinese army, with their officers being westerners and soldiers and NCOs as natives have a distinct lack of unity.\" Now, this is mainly a comment on the British army. But keep in mind, in the early days of war, all western enemy are counted as one big blob of people. Another quote later in the book. \"\u6226\u306f\u52dd\u3061\u3060\u3001\u5bfe\u624b\u306f\u652f\u90a3\u5175\u4ee5\u4e0b\u306e\u5f31\u866b\u3067\u3001\u6226\u8eca\u3082\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u3082\u304c\u305f\u304c\u305f\u306e\u5bc4\u305b\u96c6\u3081\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3001\u52dd\u3064\u306b\u6c7a\u307e\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001\u552f\u5982\u4f55\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3058\u3087\u3046\u305a\u306b\u52dd\u3064\u304b\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3060\u3051\u3060\u3002\" \"Although in battle they may win, our enemies are cowards that are more afraid than the Chinese soldiers, with the thinking that gathering as much tanks and planes will win them the war. Our victory is assured, the only problem is how to make that win better.\" You might think \"Wow such arrogance!\". Unfortunately for the Japanese military command, they severely underestimated the ability of western allies. Now, that leads to us to the question \"why?\". Here's an excerpt from a meeting that happened in March, 1942 of the Japanese military command regarding world situation. They specifically talked about the Americans here. \"\u7c73\u306e\u4eba\u7684\u6226\u529b\u306f\u7269\u7684\u6226\u529b\u306b\u4f34\u308f\u3056\u308b\u3079\u3057\u3002 \" Americans should use their man power and their material power to respond. \"\u7269\u7684\u6226\u529b\u81a8\u5927\u306a\u308b\u3082\u3001\u7c73\u306e\u653f\u6cbb\u7d4c\u6e08\u6a5f\u69cb\u306f\u3001\u4eca\u306a\u304a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7dcf\u529b\u6226\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u308b\u81e8\u6226\u614b\u52e2\u3092\u6574\u5099\u3057\u3066\u304a\u3089\u305a\u3001\u4e4b\u304c\u78ba\u7acb\u306b\u306f\u4eca\u5f8c\u5e7e\u591a\u306e\u6469\u64e6\u7d1b\u7cfe\u3092\u751f\u305a\u3079\u3057\u3002 \" \"Even though their war front on the material front will expand, the current situation of American political and social administration is still not ready for total war, they should have a lot of internal conflicts to deal with.\" Then the last one, where we finally can take a glimpse on how they viewed the common Americans. \"\u7c73\u82f1\u56fd\u6c11\u306f\u751f\u6d3b\u7a0b\u5ea6\u9ad8\u304f\u3001\u4e4b\u304c\u4f4e\u4e0b\u306f\u305d\u306e\u3059\u3053\u3076\u308b\u82e6\u75db\u3068\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3053\u308d\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3001\u6226\u6377\u306e\u5e0c\u671b\u306a\u304d\u6226\u4e89\u7d99\u7d9a\u306f\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0d\u5b89\u3092\u91b8\u6210\u3059\u3002\u4e00\u822c\u306b\u58eb\u6c17\u306e\u8870\u9000\u3092\u62db\u6765\u3059\u3079\u3057\" \"American and British citizens live in high standard quality of life, with the war coming and their living standard dropping there will come a pain with them, once we crushed their hope to achieve victory, social collapse should be imminent and moral in the general population should come.\". As it comes, the Military command viewed the Americans as people who are used to a good life, and thus should not be able to take it when the war drags on and their standard of life goes down. Probably the biggest underestimate in the war. Now, that should give you the basic reasons. Now, as for how the Americans were viewed. Although I cannot give you a general sense, because let's be honest, generalizing an entire population is stupid, but here are a couple quotes from books from the 1930s. From the book \"\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u6b63\u4f53\" \"The true America\". The book was written in 1939, pre-war. Here's the excerpt on Americans. \"\u7c73\u570b\u4eba\u306e\u53cb\u60c5\u2015\u610f\u5730\u60e1\u304d\u59d1\" \"Friendship of Americans, the jealous aunt\". In this chapter it specifically describes Americans as the jealous aunt who although befriended a young nephew (Japan), but couldn't let him become something bigger because of jealously. Here's another book on Americans from the period \"\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u3092\u89b3\u3066\u4f55\u3092\u6559\u3078\u3089\u308c\u305f\u304b\" \"What can we learn by looking at America\". The book was written in 1938, In the book there is a chapter that deals with Americans, specifically an attempt at American psychology. \"America is not a poor country, indeed, in contrary to the Japanese society where we had to work hard and sweat for each meal. They would have problems of where to spend money\" The book was actually a book that praises america, but still fails to grasp the basic understanding of American society. And then we have this book \"\u4e9c\u7d30\u4e9c\u6c11\u65cf\u3068\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\" \"The Asian race and the Pacific\". This book was written in 1940, in it it also has a chapter that deals with Americans, this time with a much harsher tone. \"The American, at their very core, are materialistic animals. To them, the only measure of success is how much they can own. They do not have a spiritual culture, or any culture with regards to their nation. To them, the measure on how a country is successful is it's rich and the machines, and the entertainment. The only thing they value, is if something provides enough entertainment for them. \"This thing is useful\" \"This thing is not useful\" is their only thought when considering. If something does not provide immediate use, they would think \"Nonsense!\" America does not have culture, nor noble traditions. To them, sports, jazz, love, gambling, gaming, is all they know.....America is shallow, it is morally corrupt. Americanism is a poison upon their society.\" Some of these sentiments do reflect greatly in the civilian population, and add on top of that American racism towards the Japanese. And you get this huge hodgepodge of ridicule, hate, and sense of superiority towards the Americans. One last quote, this is a book from 1932. \"\u6311\u3080\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\" \"Challenging America\". In there, a chapter deals with Americans again. I'm going to paraphrase what they say in there. \"Americans are people we must watch. Americans have a deep rooted racism towards us Japanese, For example, in 1924 a survey was conducted on the sentiment towards the anti-japanese law. In the Eastern states it was 5%, in the middle states it was 50%, and in the southern states it was 50%, and in the Western states it was 80%. That is how the Americans truly view us. Not as a friend where they seem to look like, but an enemy.\" As you can see, pre-war it was less about the savagery of the Americans, but rather their better quality of life making them weaker willed.

I will focus on how the military command view and a couple books from the time to discuss this. You are asking about how people viewed the americans, so I am going to focus my answer on that rather than the view on the American government. Which is completely different. Now that's out of the way. Let's answer part of your question first. How did the Japanese military viewed the Americans WW2? One of the ways we can look at that is to look for a published book by the Japanese army immediately after the outbreak of the Pacific theater. The book is titled \"\u3053\u308c\u3060\u3051\u8aad\u3081\u3070\u6226\u306f\u52dd\u3066\u308b\" (Read this and the war can be won). The book was a manual that is suppose to be read by the Japanese soldiers and in it it specifically deals with what kind of people the westerners are (Which, includes Americans.) The title sounds super cheesy and reads like one of those \"Read this and succeed!\" type of scam books today, but it's actually a pretty consolidated book on how a solider is suppose to think. (Of course, effects varied on people, just like today.) Here's an excerpt of the book dealing with Westerners. \"\u4eca\u5ea6\u306e\u6575\u306f\u652f\u90a3\u8ecd\u3068\u6bd4\u3079\u308b\u3068\u3001\u5c06\u6821\u306f\u897f\u6d0b\u4eba\u3067\u4e0b\u58eb\u5b98\u306f\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u571f\u4eba\u3067\u3042\u308b\u304b\u3089\u3001\u8ecd\u968a\u306e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u306e\u7cbe\u795e\u7684\u56e3\u7d50\u306f\u5168\u304f\u96f6\u3060\u3002 \" Translation: \"The enemy this time, compared to the Chinese army, with their officers being westerners and soldiers and NCOs as natives have a distinct lack of unity.\" Now, this is mainly a comment on the British army. But keep in mind, in the early days of war, all western enemy are counted as one big blob of people. Another quote later in the book. \"\u6226\u306f\u52dd\u3061\u3060\u3001\u5bfe\u624b\u306f\u652f\u90a3\u5175\u4ee5\u4e0b\u306e\u5f31\u866b\u3067\u3001\u6226\u8eca\u3082\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u3082\u304c\u305f\u304c\u305f\u306e\u5bc4\u305b\u96c6\u3081\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3001\u52dd\u3064\u306b\u6c7a\u307e\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001\u552f\u5982\u4f55\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3058\u3087\u3046\u305a\u306b\u52dd\u3064\u304b\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3060\u3051\u3060\u3002\" \"Although in battle they may win, our enemies are cowards that are more afraid than the Chinese soldiers, with the thinking that gathering as much tanks and planes will win them the war. Our victory is assured, the only problem is how to make that win better.\" You might think \"Wow such arrogance!\". Unfortunately for the Japanese military command, they severely underestimated the ability of western allies. Now, that leads to us to the question \"why?\". Here's an excerpt from a meeting that happened in March, 1942 of the Japanese military command regarding world situation. They specifically talked about the Americans here. \"\u7c73\u306e\u4eba\u7684\u6226\u529b\u306f\u7269\u7684\u6226\u529b\u306b\u4f34\u308f\u3056\u308b\u3079\u3057\u3002 \" Americans should use their man power and their material power to respond. \"\u7269\u7684\u6226\u529b\u81a8\u5927\u306a\u308b\u3082\u3001\u7c73\u306e\u653f\u6cbb\u7d4c\u6e08\u6a5f\u69cb\u306f\u3001\u4eca\u306a\u304a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7dcf\u529b\u6226\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u308b\u81e8\u6226\u614b\u52e2\u3092\u6574\u5099\u3057\u3066\u304a\u3089\u305a\u3001\u4e4b\u304c\u78ba\u7acb\u306b\u306f\u4eca\u5f8c\u5e7e\u591a\u306e\u6469\u64e6\u7d1b\u7cfe\u3092\u751f\u305a\u3079\u3057\u3002 \" \"Even though their war front on the material front will expand, the current situation of American political and social administration is still not ready for total war, they should have a lot of internal conflicts to deal with.\" Then the last one, where we finally can take a glimpse on how they viewed the common Americans. \"\u7c73\u82f1\u56fd\u6c11\u306f\u751f\u6d3b\u7a0b\u5ea6\u9ad8\u304f\u3001\u4e4b\u304c\u4f4e\u4e0b\u306f\u305d\u306e\u3059\u3053\u3076\u308b\u82e6\u75db\u3068\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3053\u308d\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3001\u6226\u6377\u306e\u5e0c\u671b\u306a\u304d\u6226\u4e89\u7d99\u7d9a\u306f\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0d\u5b89\u3092\u91b8\u6210\u3059\u3002\u4e00\u822c\u306b\u58eb\u6c17\u306e\u8870\u9000\u3092\u62db\u6765\u3059\u3079\u3057\" \"American and British citizens live in high standard quality of life, with the war coming and their living standard dropping there will come a pain with them, once we crushed their hope to achieve victory, social collapse should be imminent and moral in the general population should come.\". As it comes, the Military command viewed the Americans as people who are used to a good life, and thus should not be able to take it when the war drags on and their standard of life goes down. Probably the biggest underestimate in the war. Now, that should give you the basic reasons. Now, as for how the Americans were viewed. Although I cannot give you a general sense, because let's be honest, generalizing an entire population is stupid, but here are a couple quotes from books from the 1930s. From the book \"\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u6b63\u4f53\" \"The true America\". The book was written in 1939, pre-war. Here's the excerpt on Americans. \"\u7c73\u570b\u4eba\u306e\u53cb\u60c5\u2015\u610f\u5730\u60e1\u304d\u59d1\" \"Friendship of Americans, the jealous aunt\". In this chapter it specifically describes Americans as the jealous aunt who although befriended a young nephew (Japan), but couldn't let him become something bigger because of jealously. Here's another book on Americans from the period \"\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u3092\u89b3\u3066\u4f55\u3092\u6559\u3078\u3089\u308c\u305f\u304b\" \"What can we learn by looking at America\". The book was written in 1938, In the book there is a chapter that deals with Americans, specifically an attempt at American psychology. \"America is not a poor country, indeed, in contrary to the Japanese society where we had to work hard and sweat for each meal. They would have problems of where to spend money\" The book was actually a book that praises america, but still fails to grasp the basic understanding of American society. And then we have this book \"\u4e9c\u7d30\u4e9c\u6c11\u65cf\u3068\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\" \"The Asian race and the Pacific\". This book was written in 1940, in it it also has a chapter that deals with Americans, this time with a much harsher tone. \"The American, at their very core, are materialistic animals. To them, the only measure of success is how much they can own. They do not have a spiritual culture, or any culture with regards to their nation. To them, the measure on how a country is successful is it's rich and the machines, and the entertainment. The only thing they value, is if something provides enough entertainment for them. \"This thing is useful\" \"This thing is not useful\" is their only thought when considering. If something does not provide immediate use, they would think \"Nonsense!\" America does not have culture, nor noble traditions. To them, sports, jazz, love, gambling, gaming, is all they know.....America is shallow, it is morally corrupt. Americanism is a poison upon their society.\" Some of these sentiments do reflect greatly in the civilian population, and add on top of that American racism towards the Japanese. And you get this huge hodgepodge of ridicule, hate, and sense of superiority towards the Americans. One last quote, this is a book from 1932. \"\u6311\u3080\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\" \"Challenging America\". In there, a chapter deals with Americans again. I'm going to paraphrase what they say in there. \"Americans are people we must watch. Americans have a deep rooted racism towards us Japanese, For example, in 1924 a survey was conducted on the sentiment towards the anti-japanese law. In the Eastern states it was 5%, in the middle states it was 50%, and in the southern states it was 50%, and in the Western states it was 80%. That is how the Americans truly view us. Not as a friend where they seem to look like, but an enemy.\" As you can see, pre-war it was less about the savagery of the Americans, but rather their better quality of life making them weaker willed. On top of a sort of anti-american sentiment born as a reaction from the Modern racism that was experienced by Japanese immigrants."}

I also think this would be a good topic because you could talk about how it relates to so many other things happening at the time-- influences of the Cold War, how women were involved, nationalism, decolonization, etc. There are also a ton of different players that took part who would be interesting (really great French authors like Beauvoir and Sartre and Camus, the Harkis, soldiers who witnessed torture, men and women who were tortured, young men who resisted the draft). Anyway, IDK if world history classes cover the 20th century, but if so I definitely think this is the kind of topic I would have loved in high school. In fact, I feel like my high school history classes really neglected decolonization in general. But this case I think is special because of the high tensions it caused, moving into the 21st century! If you decide to take this route I'd be happy to give you some more ideas, but I realize that this topic might not be appropriate for your class in spite of my excitement about it. Good luck wrapping up the school year! And good on you for not just showing Mulan."}

{"original_text": "In old Western movies, trackers were super good at following people across the land. They could run really fast and not get tired. But, in real life, tracking is not that easy. A tracker can follow someone, but it depends on the terrain, weather, and how well they know the area. What's realistic is that a tracker can follow footprints, broken twigs, and other signs left behind by the person being tracked. They can also use their knowledge of the land and the person's habits to guess where they might be going. There are many interesting historical aspects of tracking. For example, some Native American tribes were super good at tracking and used it to hunt and protect their lands.

{"original_text": "After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. The following stages are used for breast cancer: Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) Stage I Stage II Stage IIIA Stage IIIB Stage IIIC Stage IV After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. The process used to find out if the cancer has spread within the breast or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Some procedures may expose the unborn baby to harmful radiation or dyes. These procedures are done only if absolutely necessary. Certain actions can be taken to expose the unborn baby to as little radiation as possible, such as the use of a leadlined shield to cover the abdomen. The following tests and procedures may be used to stage breast cancer during pregnancy: Sentinel lymph node biopsy: The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Bone scan: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the liver, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. Chest xray: An xray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if breast cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually breast cancer cells. The disease is metastatic breast cancer, not bone cancer. The following stages are used for breast cancer: This section describes the stages of breast cancer. The breast cancer stage is based on the results of testing that is done on the tumor and lymph nodes removed during surgery and other tests. Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) There are 3 types of breast carcinoma in situ: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a noninvasive condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct. The abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast. In some cases, DCIS may become invasive cancer and spread to other tissues. At this time, there is no way to know which lesions could become invasive. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lobules of the breast. This condition seldom becomes invasive cancer. However, having LCIS in one breast increases the risk of developing breast cancer in either breast. Paget disease of the nipple is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the nipple only. Stage I In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB. In stage IA, the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. Cancer has not spread outside the breast. In stage IB, small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes and either: no tumor is found in the breast; or the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. Stage II Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB. In stage IIA: no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. Cancer (larger than 2 millimeters) is found in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or in the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy); or the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes. In stage IIB, the tumor is: larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters. Small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes; or larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or to the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy); or larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes. Stage IIIA In stage IIIA: no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor may be any size. Cancer is found in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes or in the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during imaging tests or a physical exam); or the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters. Small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes; or the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or to the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy). Stage IIIB In stage IIIB, the tumor may be any size and cancer has spread to the chest wall and/or to the skin of the breast and caused swelling or an ulcer. Also, cancer may have spread to: up to 9 axillary lymph nodes; or the lymph nodes near the breastbone. Cancer that has spread to the skin of the breast may also be inflammatory breast cancer. See the section on Inflammatory Breast Cancer for more information. Stage IIIC In stage IIIC, no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor may be any size. Cancer may have spread to the skin of the breast and caused swelling or an ulcer and/or has spread to the chest wall. Also, cancer has spread to: 10 or more axillary lymph nodes; or lymph nodes above or below the collarbone; or axillary lymph nodes and lymph nodes near the breastbone. Cancer that has spread to the skin of the breast may also be inflammatory breast cancer. See the section on Inflammatory Breast Cancer for more information.

Stage IIIB In stage IIIB, the tumor may be any size and cancer has spread to the chest wall and/or to the skin of the breast and caused swelling or an ulcer. Also, cancer may have spread to: up to 9 axillary lymph nodes; or the lymph nodes near the breastbone. Cancer that has spread to the skin of the breast may also be inflammatory breast cancer. See the section on Inflammatory Breast Cancer for more information. Stage IIIC In stage IIIC, no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor may be any size. Cancer may have spread to the skin of the breast and caused swelling or an ulcer and/or has spread to the chest wall. Also, cancer has spread to: 10 or more axillary lymph nodes; or lymph nodes above or below the collarbone; or axillary lymph nodes and lymph nodes near the breastbone. Cancer that has spread to the skin of the breast may also be inflammatory breast cancer. See the section on Inflammatory Breast Cancer for more information. For treatment, stage IIIC breast cancer is divided into operable and inoperable stage IIIC. Stage IV In stage IV, cancer has spread to other organs of the body, most often the bones, lungs, liver, or brain."}
{"original_text": "Ships requistioned by the Royal Navy from British citizens during WWI fell into two main categories: liners requisitioned for use as Armed Merchant Cruisers (AMCs) and trawlers, yachts and drifters hired for patrol duties. The former category included several ships that had been built using money loaned or invested by the British government. This came with the stipulation that, in event of war, these ships would be turned over to the Royal Navy for conversion into AMCs. Such ships were typically constructed with reinforced decks and fittings for guns, to ease conversion. Ships that fit into this category include the Cunard liners *Mauritania* and *Lusitania*, though they were never really used as AMCs. As part of an agreement signed in 1903, Cunard were paid \u00a3150,000 per year, in return for putting these two ships at the disposition of the RN, with the International Mercantile Marine Co receiving similar payments for the potential use of White Star Line ships. Otherwise, if a shipping line wished to take a contract with the Royal Mail to carry mail, its ships would have to be made available to the RN in time of war, Subsidies were also granted to ships that might have been useful Either way, the owners were well compensated prior to the war beginning. Whether or not the ship was built with RN funds, the ships were hired from their owners. An example would be the P & O liner *Macedonia*, which cost the RN \u00a31,698 per week. Rates for the hire of Cunard and IMM ships were set by the 1903 agreement, with the Cunard ships being available at a rate of 25 shillings per month per ton. The ships were also available for outright purchase, at a rate of 110% of their value at time of purchase. In addition, the owners would be compensated when a hired ship was lost. For example, the White Star Line's *Oceanic* was estimated, in 1905, to cost \u00a3705,617 if she were to be lost. Meanwhile, owners of smaller ships, whether hired or requisitioned, were also compensated. Hire rates were initially set at 12 per cent per registered ton, with four percent depreciation from the original cost per year. However, this was found to be insufficient, and it was swiftly raised to 18 per cent. Typical pay for trawler hire by the RN was \u00a3100 per month. Several ships under construction in Britain were also requistioned or purchased from foreign governments. The most important were the Ottoman battleships, *Sultan Osman I* and *Re\u015fadiye*, the Chilean battleships *Almirante Cochrane* and *Almirante Latorre*, and the Italian liner *Conte Rosso*. Several destroyers, cruisers and monitors were also requisitioned, from navies including the Greek, Portuguese and Brazilian. In the case of the Ottoman ships, no compensation was paid, as the Ottoman declaration of war came soon after their requisitioning. *Almirante Cochrane* and *Conte Rosso* were purchased while incomplete, and both were converted into carriers, with the former becoming HMS Eagle and the second becoming HMS Argus. *Almirante Latorre* was purchased by the RN in 1914, and served as HMS Canada.

When a person is healing, the best they will probably do is cell division at this rate. However, keep in mind that not EVERY CELL in the body would be dividing at this rate. Only the cells in the localized injury region would be getting signals to divide (for example, if you get a cut on your finger, skin cells on your foot wont be activated to divide for the healing response). This means that only a small number of cells would be dividing for wound regeneration in response to injury. Since I'm technically a \"biomedical engineer\", here's where I *should* give you a hypothetical example with numbers for surface area, cell volume, and wound volume. Then, I would use this to give you a hypothetical time for the wound to fully regenerate. I'm not going to do this for 2 reasons. First, I am incredibly lazy. I am putting off research to type this up because I am too lazy to work (and I am too lazy to give you a proper response as well). Second, there's more to wound regeneration than just cell division. You can think of a tissue as comprised of two components: cells, and extracellular matrix. Cells are the machines of the body: they perform functions (create extracellular matrix, process waste, create movement, and nutrient transportation are just a few of the thousands of functions cells do). Extracellular matrix(ECM) is the stuff that holds the cells together. The most obvious example of ECM is bone, which is comprised of a calcium phosphate material called hydroxyapatite. Obviously your cells are not strong enough to support 100+ pounds of weight, so a strong rigid structure is required to do that (ECM). So now we run into the obvious problem: in order to heal a wound, we need to replace cells and ECM. We know the division rate of cells: about one division every day. Well, what's the rate of ECM deposition? This is poorly characterized in science, if even characterized at all. It depends on many factors (cell type, cellular microenvironment, nutrients, etc). Not only that, but the need for ECM deposition also affects the rate of cell division. Cells have many functions, including cell division (to replace lost cells) and ECM synthesis (to replace lost ECM). The cells have to essentially do both to fully regenerate an injury. So how long would this take? I have no clue. At all. A physician might give you a good estimate from experience, but they would not be able to give you exact numbers on the healing *speed*. Can we speed up healing? Absolutely. That's what my field of research is, and there are many other fields that are are also looking at ways to speed up healing in other ways.

He was able to argue their advantages: unlike a cannon, a rocket was quite light, and it had no recoil. For naval use, therefore, rockets seemed to be ideal. Why load a ship with thousands of pounds of heavy cannon, and then have it battered by their recoil, when it could carry the same weight of rockets and be more effective? While only a very large ship could carry enough cannon to be a threat to another ship of the line, even a small sloop could carry enough rockets to threaten a large frigate. Congreve had his chance, the government invested in them, and his incendiary rockets were employed during the Napoleonic Wars.

The furthest west any battle ever got was Santa Fe, New Mexico at the battle of Glorieta Pass which took place in 1862. Some 400 Union Soldiers engaged a Texan incursion of 200-300 into the Southwest which had the intent of routing Federal troops and capturing the New Mexico Territory. The Confederate invasion was halted and the troops were forced back to Texas. California played an interesting role in the war. Over 43,000 citizens of California either volunteered for California regiments or joined Pennsylvania and Virginian ones. At the time California had only some 430,000 people residing and some 50,000 of them were foreigners. When Fort Sumter was fired upon the commander of the Department of the Pacific was a southerner, Brigadier General Albert Sidney Johnston. Johnston would go on to serve the Confederacy as the commander of the Army of Tennessee and is later killed at Shiloh. Johnston was opposed to secession but a Southerner to the core. Confederate sympathizers (Knights of the Golden Circle) in California attempted to convince Johnston to join their plan to capture Alcatraz (which at the time was a naval battery not a prison), Benicia, and Fort Point thereby disabling the Union defenses in the West. The Southerners wanted to form the \"Pacific Republic\" which would be from the SF Bay all the way up to Washington. Johnston responded to the sympathizers with a public message: \"There is something I want to mention. I have heard foolish talk about an attempt to seize the strongholds under my charge. Knowing this, I have prepared for emergencies, and will defend the property. of the United States with every resource at my command, and with the last drop of blood in my body. Tell that to all our Southern friends.\" Johnston ordered readiness at all fortifications and strengthened their garrisons. Soon after Johnston was relived of his command by the Secretary of War, Winfield Scott, out of fear another possible southern plot. After Johnston's relief he resigned from the Army and traveled to New Orleans were he joined the Confederate Army as a General.

Signs and symptoms of glutaric acidemia type II (GA2) can vary widely depending on the age of onset and severity of the condition in each affected individual. In most cases, the condition appears in infancy or early childhood as a sudden episode called a metabolic crisis which causes weakness; behavior changes such as poor feeding and decreased activity; and vomiting. These crises can be lifethreatening and may be triggered by common childhood illnesses or other stresses on the body. The most severe cases may appear in the neonatal period (within the first 4 weeks of life) and may also be characterized by the presence of physical abnormalities at birth. These abnormalities may include brain malformations; an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly); a weakened and enlarged heart (dilated cardiomyopathy); fluidfilled cysts and other malformations of the kidneys; unusual facial features; and genital abnormalities. Some affected individuals have a characteristic odor resembling sweaty feet. Other cases are less severe and may appear later in childhood, in adolescence, or in adulthood.

Some said he was effeminate in appearance. Several women he appears to have had an interest in committed suicide. He never had children and he never married his mistress. So because of this perceived puzzle, a lot has been written. In contrast, people don't ask the same questions about, say, Mussolini. Or Stalin. Or Francisco Franco or other evil men. Humans in general have a lot of interest in gossipy things like this so greater interest has been fueled by pretty strong evidence that there was something strange about Hitler's sexuality. Speculation by others has only fueled more speculation, since no one has any answers. For example, one persistent rumor was that Hitler only had one testicle. An old doctor of his said that this wasn't true, while some others pointed to the info you just read about the micro-penis and the undescended testicle, to say the opposite. There's no definitive proof either way, but the discussion is salacious and inherently belittling to Hitler, thus it amuses. Another example: the US had psychiatrists do a psych profile of Hitler during the war, and it was heavily Freudian, so made a lot of leaps of logic that psychologists and psychiatrists wouldn't do today.

{"original_text": "Diagnostic tests and a biopsy are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood rhabdomyosarcoma. The diagnostic tests that are done depend in part on where the cancer forms. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Xray: An xray of the organs and bones inside the body, such as the chest. An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen, pelvis, or lymph nodes, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the skull, brain, and lymph nodes. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Bone scan: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone. Samples are removed from both hipbones. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. Lumbar puncture: A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer cells. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap. If these tests show there may be a rhabdomyosarcoma, a biopsy is done. A biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Because treatment depends on the type of rhabdomyosarcoma, biopsy samples should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing rhabdomyosarcoma. One of the following types of biopsies may be used: Fineneedle aspiration (FNA) biopsy: The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle. Core needle biopsy: The removal of tissue using a wide needle. This procedure may be guided using ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. Open biopsy: The removal of tissue through an incision (cut) made in the skin. Sentinel lymph node biopsy: The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed: Light microscopy: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and highpowered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells. Immunohistochemistry: A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer. FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization): A laboratory test used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide. When these pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide, they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light. This type of test is used to find certain gene changes. Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) test: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for certain changes in the structure or function of genes.

Because the symptoms are common for other conditions, your doctor will determine if you have heart failure by doing a detailed medical history, an examination, and several tests. The tests will identify whether you have any diseases or conditions that can cause heart failure. They will also rule out any other causes of your symptoms and determine the amount of damage to your heart. During a physical examination, you can expect your doctor to listen to your heart for abnormal sounds and listen to your lungs for a buildup of fluid. Your doctor will also look for swelling in your ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and in the veins in your neck If your doctor determines that you have signs of heart failure, he or she may order several tests. Diagnostic Tests Tests that are given to determine heart failure include an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG), a chest xray, and a BNP blood test. An EKG or ECG electrocardiogram measures the rate and regularity of your heartbeat. This test can also show if you have had a heart attack and whether the walls of your heart have thickened. A chest Xray takes a picture of your heart and lungs. It will show whether your heart is enlarged or your lungs have fluid in them, both signs of heart failure. A BNP blood test measures the level of a hormone in your blood called BNP brain natriuretic peptide that increases in heart failure. Once these initial tests have been performed, your doctor may decide to send you to a cardiologist, a specialist in the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease.

And best of all, the growing concentration of people and interactions - including external transactions - multiplies the initial geographical advantage of clustering larger numbers in a smaller space. The Tunisian scholar Ibn Khaldun noted the urban phenomenon even in the 14th century: \"When those cities fell into ruins, sedentary culture, which God has devised for the attainment of sciences and crafts, disappeared from them.\" In history there seems to be, as you note, an additional competition effect between polities: it's been cited as a reason for Europe taking a lead in the latter half of the last millennium. It's almost a universal given, from the emergence of the first urban concentrations drawing on their regional agrarian surplus to sustain specialised city communities. What would be really interesting is to draw together the trends with periods of economic growth or contraction: to what extent are whole cultures predicated on mere urbanity?"}
{"original_text": "Crews on fighting ships were large because there was a lot more to do than just run the rigging -- particularly in battle, guns needed crews of 7-10 men (or more) and ships would often try to ensure there were enough men to fight, if not both sides, at least some of the guns on the other broadside. They'd also have to do that while still sailing and navigating the ship, running powder from the magazines, caring for the wounded, communicating with the admiral, etc. When not in battle, ships needed large crews to be able to quickly make sail or take it in, lower boats and other gear over the side, weigh the ship's anchors and do a lot of the other mundane tasks of sailing. Certainly merchant ship crews could get along with a dozen or so people to carry cargo, but bigger crews would make the process quite a bit quicker. As to how crews were organized, there were ~~three~~ four main classes of people aboard ships: commissioned officers, warrant or petty officers, seamen, and Marines. (There were also sometimes people outside the chain of command, such as for example supercargoes, ambassadors, wives and sometimes children, but let's keep it simple for now). The commissioned officers received, well, a commission from the Navy and would include the captain and his lieutenants, as well as of course an admiral if one were aboard. Midshipmen, usually teenage boys, were technically master's mates (that is, mates of the sailing master, a warrant officer), but were understood to be officers in training, though they could be disrated and turned before the mast for poor behavior. (This is a plot point in the Aubrey-Maturin series of books.) Warrant officers included men permanently attached to the ship, such as the gunner, master, boatswain, and carpenter, as well as the surgeon, purser and chaplain. There was to an extent a divide between the \"gentlemen officers\" such as the surgeon, purser and chaplain and the \"tarpaulin\" sailing officers. The sailing master and the officers were usually the only men aboard who understood navigation, with the midshipmen learning it. The warrant officers generally had mates to help them run the ship. The sailors themselves were generally organized into divisions, at least after the 1750s or so, usually organized by the mast they belonged to or the other jobs they had. The idlers -- that is, the men who just worked all day and didn't stand a watch, such as the sailmaker and his mates, or the stewards, or carpenter's mates -- usually were in their own division, and an officer was assigned to each division. The goal of that was to ensure that in a large mass of men -- 700 or more in large ships -- every man would have an officer or midshipman who at least knew his name, station, etc. Marines were naval infantry, commanded by a Marine officer (usually a lieutenant or captain; the captain would brevetted to \"major\" while aboard so there would only be one captain aboard) who guarded the officers and the powder magazine, and were used as infantry in shore landings and wielded muskets in sea battles. The Marines were allowed to learn seamanly skills if their schedules permitted, but couldn't be ordered aloft, and generally kept separate from the regular sailors -- the crews were quite aware that they were there partially to quell mutinies, by force if necessary, and there was often some bad blood between them.

{"original_text": "The origin of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fluctuations is a fundamental question in modern astrophysics. The CMB is the thermal radiation left over from the Big Bang, and its fluctuations are a key feature of the universe's large-scale structure. The most widely accepted theory is that these fluctuations arose from quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, known as quantum fluctuations in the vacuum energy density.

{"original_text": "How is multiple epiphyseal dysplasia inherited? Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) may be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner depending on the genetic cause. Most cases are autosomal dominant. In autosomal dominant inheritance, having a mutation in only one of the 2 copies of the responsible gene is enough to cause the condition. The mutation may be inherited from a parent or can occur for the first time in the affected person. Each child of a person with an autosomal dominant condition has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutation. More rarely, MED is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In autosomal recessive inheritance, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers.

{"original_text": "In general, a coil wound with hollow wire can exhibit lower losses at high frequencies compared to a similar coil wound with standard wire. This is because hollow wire has a lower skin depth, which means that the current flowing through the wire is less confined to the surface, reducing the ohmic losses. Additionally, hollow wire can have a lower dielectric constant, which can also contribute to reduced losses. In terms of other respects, a coil wound with hollow wire may behave better in terms of: * Reduced thermal expansion: Hollow wire tends to expand less with temperature changes, which can improve the coil's stability and reliability. * Improved mechanical strength: The hollow core can provide additional structural support, making the coil more resistant to mechanical stress. * Enhanced thermal management: The hollow core can provide a path for heat to escape, reducing the risk of overheating.

Because melanocytes migrate in to the highly differentiated epithelial tissue, these melanocytes are then the most easily transformed cells when it comes to oncogenic mutations.

{"original_text": "This is one of the fruits of DNA sequencing, especially sequencing across many different organisms. One of the core precepts in phylogenetic analysis is that when a group of related organisms posses the same feature then it is very likely that their common ancestor also had that feature. Once we started sequencing DNA and genes we could take this core insight and apply it to the gene sequences themselves. What we discovered is that many genes are shared by many organisms. For instance all extant mammals have a very, very similar gene for the protein haemoglobin. This tells us that our common ancestor almost certainly had a gene for haemoglobin. And because all mammalian haemoglobins have very, very similar sequences it tells us that the ancetral haemoglobin was also very similar. In seomwhat straightforward way we can estimate genes which were present in ancestral species. Looking at subsets of genes that one group (say apes) share but another group does not (say horses) and combining that with our knowledge of the fossil record we can estimate when groups of genes may have emerged. So any set of genes apes posses which horses do not must have appeared some time after the existance of the common ancestor of apes and horses. We can even apply this logic within species (who will all share the same genes) because every gene exists in multiple version (alleles) within a population. We can look at how the different variants of each gene map how they are distributed in certain populations. The cystic fibrosis variant of the CTFR gene is most concentrated in caucasian humans and we have good evidence that it must have arisen in the caucasian lineage. This means this gene variant can be no older than the emergence of the caucasian human subgroup. Additionally it is possible to use changes in shared genes as a molecular \"clock\". Coming back to haemoglobin this is a very, very conserved gene in mammals with few differences. This is unsurprsing as faults in the gene will prevent the animal from correctly utilising oxygen. As it changes so slowly we can map how many changes per millenia you might expect to see and in turn we can use this to date divergence time between species. Genes which change more rapidly can be used to test the time of divergence between species more closely related in geologic time. Coming back round to vitamin C. In humans there is a non-functional, de-activated gene for producting vitamin C on chromosome 8 (GULOP gene). Genomes slowly remove un-needed genes and the first step is often to accumulate mutations which deactivate the gene. In this case it was likely uneeded as the human diet as typically contained plenty of vitamin C. Once a gene is deactivated and is under no evolutionary pressure to be maintained that chromosome region will rapidly accumulate more mutations. You can use the rate of mutation accumulation in the area to to date the period when the gene was lost. > suggesting that ll cheetahs are the descendants of inbreeding.... How is it possible?

The goal of treatment is to bring blood pressure back to normal to relieve signs and symptoms. Another goal is to manage any underlying condition causing the hypotension.

In a healthy person, low blood pressure without signs or symptoms usually isn't a problem and needs no treatment. If you have signs or symptoms of hypotension, you should sit or lie down right away. Put your feet above the level of your heart. If your signs or symptoms don't go away quickly, you should seek medical care. Orthostatic Hypotension Many treatments are available for orthostatic hypotension. If you have this condition, your doctor may advise making lifestyle changes, such as: Drinking plenty of fluids, such as water or sports drinks that contain nutrients like sodium and potassium. Drinking little or no alcohol. Standing up slowly. Not crossing your legs while sitting. Slowly increasing the amount of time you sit up if you've been immobile for a long time because of a medical condition. The term \"immobile\" refers to not being able to move around very much. Eating small, lowcarbohydrate meals if you have postprandial hypotension (a form of orthostatic hypotension). Talk with your doctor about using compression stockings. These stockings apply pressure to your lower legs. The pressure helps move blood throughout your body. If medicine is causing your low blood pressure, your doctor may change the medicine or adjust the dose you take. Several medicines are used to treat orthostatic hypotension. These medicines, which raise blood pressure, include fludrocortisone and midodrine. Neurally Mediated Hypotension If you have neurally mediated hypotension (NMH), you may need to make lifestyle changes. These may include: Avoiding situations that trigger symptoms, such as standing for long periods. Unpleasant, upsetting, or scary situations also can trigger symptoms. Drinking plenty of fluids, such as water or sports drinks that contain nutrients like sodium and potassium. Increasing your salt intake (as your doctor advises). Learning to recognize symptoms that occur before fainting and taking action to raise your blood pressure. For example, sitting down and putting your head between your knees or lying down can help raise blood pressure. If medicine is causing your hypotension, your doctor may change the medicine or adjust the dose you take. He or she also may prescribe medicine to treat NMH. Children who have NHM often outgrow it. Severe Hypotension Linked to Shock Shock is a lifethreatening emergency. People who have shock need prompt treatment from medical personnel. If a person has signs or symptoms of shock, call 911 right away. The goals of treating shock are to: Restore blood flow to the organs as quickly as possible to prevent organ damage Find and reverse the cause of shock Blood or special fluids are put into the bloodstream to restore blood flow to the organs.

Neurological symptoms include awkward, unsteady movements, impaired sensory function, speech problems, and vision and hearing loss.

Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 5 and 15 but can appear in adulthood or later. The first symptom is usually difficulty in walking. The ataxia gradually worsens and slowly spreads to the arms and then the trunk. People lave loss of sensation in the arms and legs, which may spread to other parts of the body. Many people with Friedreich's ataxia develop scoliosis (a curving of the spine to one side), which, if severe, may impair breathing.

{"original_text": "Napoleon's experience of the Terror in Paris was somewhat distant and this period of the French Revolution was quite vital for his overall career. The Bonaparte clan had the misfortune of backing the losing side in the confused Revolutionary politics of Corsica, and he was in southern France in 1793 after being driven from his birthplace. Napoleon's dabbling in Coriscan politics was beneficial for him for two reasons. Firstly, it helped helped situate himself politically on the side of Paris as opposed to Corsica. Although Napoleon was a staunch partisan of the Corsican patriot Pasquale Paoli during Napoleon's formative years, Napoleon sided with Antoine Saliceti who pushed for French control of the island while Paoli advocated independence. Through his patron Saliceti, both Napoleon and his brother Lucien were able to gain entry into the various Jacobin clubs in the south of France. These social networks allowed the Bonaparte family to reconstruct their lives and for Napoleon to recast himself as a French soldier loyal to the state. These connections were vital for his military promotion as he possessed a degree of competence and training, and was able to gain promotion due to his connections with Robespierre's brother Augustin. The second reason Napoleon's Corsican and southern France interlude was important for his long-term trajectory was that it put Napoleon in a relative sideshow during the most politically charged moments of the Revolution. Thus Napoleon was not present for the execution of Louis XVI and experienced the turn of events in Paris from a distance. This meant there was very little that political enemies could pin on him for his actions during the Revolution. As Consul, Napoleon would claim to be the champion of order and as a neutral figure above political factions. This feat was easier to accomplish because although Napoleon politically flirted with Jacobinism, he was not politically compromised by it. The greatest danger to Napoleon's literal neck was not the Terror, but the Thermidorian Reaction that ended it. Napoleon's connection to Augustin for his rapid promotion and his Jacobin network in southern France now proved to be a liability. Saliceti had denounced Napoleon to the new powers in Paris, likely in an attempt to save his own skin and eliminate a potential rival, and Napoleon was arrested and held for two weeks. Although tradition holds that he as imprisoned in the prison of Fort-Carr\u00e9 for two weeks, Dwyer's biography has found he was likely under house arrest. But fortunately for Napoleon, Saliceti now worked for his release, with the former realizing that if Napoleon were put on trial, then his protege could attack his former patron and Saliceti was far more compromised by Jacobinism than Napoleon. So Napoleon sailed through both the Terror and Thermidor by both being in the right place and time as well as having the right friends. Other officers who received rapid promotion under the Jacobins were not so lucky. Napoleon managed to evade the Thermodorian purging of the officer corps that culled 40% of generals in active service during the Terror. This period in French history also underscored to Napoleon the importance of having the right political connections, and after his arrest, Napoleon sought to broaden his social network, which soon included Paul Barras.

To first understand *why* such a change could happen, it is a good idea to know the background. The Shah of Iran was not a very well-liked man. His secret police, the SAVAK, was extremely effective in rooting out, torturing and executing opposition and his reliance on the west to stay in power made him very unpopular among the Iranian population. During this time of oppression, which in 1975 banned the only other political party, making it a one-party state, the only real way to express dissent was through religion. Muhammad Reza Shah did his best to secularize the country and bring it back to its more Persian roots, but due to the power of the Ulama (guardians of the legal tradition of Islam), this was not successful. Thanks to Ayatollah Khomeini's anti-shah preaching during his time in exile, he was a reasonably popular man within the Iranian opposition, and Khomeini's most important base of support was his claim that the Shah was a puppet of the US, but more importantly, not following the true path of Islam. For most people then, Islam became the way they could strengthen their nationalism, evict western powers from their country and end the oppression of the Shah.

And, as Grant Thornton recommends: In most cases, it\u2019s generally a good idea to register for GST/HST as soon as your business is established. Provided that your business makes (or will make) taxable or zero-rated supplies, early registration ensures that GST/HST paid on costs incurred is recoverable since tax paid prior to registration is generally not recoverable except on the purchase of inventory, capital property and prepaid services still on hand at the time of registration. Be sure to register early because, in many situations, registering late can result in the loss of recoverable GST paid before registration."}

If that sounds surprising, keep in mind that incandescent lightbulbs are extremely inefficient, with less than five percent of the energy put in being converted to visible light. This is because the bulbs are black body emitters, which need pretty damn high temperatures (about 3000K) or so to emit significant amounts of visible light and most of the energy used to heat them up ends up being dissipated as heat (e.g. as infrared thermal radiation). Edit: An interesting tangent is that lighting, because it is both so ubiquitous and inefficient is actually responsible for a huge fraction of our energy consumption, lighting eating up roughly 20% of all the electricity produced.

{"original_text": "When talking about the history of environmentalism in the United States, it is important to realize that some of those ideas are relatively older, but were considered conservationism. Conservationism is a slightly different notion (preserving environmental landscapes or organisms, etc., for future generations to use \u2014 e.g., save the bison, so future generations can hunt the bison), but it does introduce some of the notions of human impact, lost \"nature\" (a complicated construct), and sets up something of a dichotomy of use versus \"saving.\" Think Henry Thoreau and Teddy Roosevelt. The transition from that to environmentalism in the early 1960s has a somewhat interesting trajectory. There was a definite impact from the nuclear fallout debate prior to the Limited Test Ban Treaty (1963). This introduced, in a new way, the idea that remote, relatively localized operations could have massive environmental effects throughout an entire ecosystem. When you set off a nuclear weapon in the desert of Nevada, the radioactivity can be traced through the ecosystems of the entire country (sometimes even the world) and back into human bodies (quite literally \u2014 baby teeth proved to be a potent way to show how fission products from nuclear tests got into human bodies, via the calcium-like strontium-90 isotope) \u2014 radioactivity is much easier to detect than chemical contamination (with a Geiger counter, you can literally track individual atoms of radioactive substances, whereas you are really limited to various parts per million for chemicals), and a whole lot of ecological research came out of this field (funded by a Cold War infrastructure that was both eager to reassure the public that these tests were safe and necessary, as well as by anti-nuclear people who wanted the testing to slow down or go away). Politically it was one of the major public health and security debates of the day, and was extremely high-profile. It is not long after that you get Rachel Carson and the _Silent Spring_ book (and debate). Carson herself used the fallout debate as an analogy to what she wanted to talk about, which was pesticides \u2014 again, a trace chemical that enters the ecosystem and food chain and potentially disrupts it violently. There are two really interesting angles of _Silent Spring_, the \"we are destroying the environment\" side of things (killing eagles, killing nature, making the spring go \"silent\", etc.) and the \"we are poisoning ourselves\" side of things (pesticides and pollution as essentially an uncontrolled experiment on human beings of fantastical proportions). Carson's allegations were taken up at extremely high levels, up to the President's Scientific Advisory Committee (PSAC). Kennedy himself commented on them, and convened further studies as to whether the American chemical industry was essentially poisoning the nation. While there were some strong denials of Carson's claims (notably by said industry) there was enough to them that there was serious discussion and consideration about at least the self-regulation of emissions of various sorts (in those pre-EPA days). The Space Race, and the photos of the Earth from space, also have been claimed to play a role in this new emergence of a sensibility of the planet as a very bounded, limited resources \u2014 a \"spaceship Earth\" (as Buckminster Fuller liked to call it), a \"pale blue dot\" (Carl Sagan), a fragile, interconnected island whose ecosystem has definite tolerances, whose animals have definite limits (the idea of extinction is much older of course, and this is where the conservationism comes in), and even a moral component about non-intervention and preservation-for-its-own-sake (not quite conservationism) that emerges. These things have always been controversial but reached enough of a consensus that no less than Richard Nixon could sign a law to create the Environmental Protection Agency by the end of this \"cycle,\" and the notion of environmentalism, the harmful effects of pollution, the detrimental blight of the despoiling of nature, and the hazards of endless, heedless growth became pretty standard parts of the American lexicon by the 1970s, well outside the circles of conservationists, hippies, etc. Like all complex social movements, pin-pointing it to a single event is difficult, and often even where you can pin-point something (say, Carson's _Silent Spring_) you end up in a somewhat recursive situation (asking \"why did _Silent Spring_ make such an impact?\" moves you up to previous conditions that \"prepared the field\" and so on). I don't think anything above is controversial in discussing this history, though, but one can probably find other factors to highlight. Short version of this is that it didn't quite \"suddenly take off,\" that it was a bit more gradual than that, and some of these ideas were relatively old (i.e. conservationism) but got recombined in new ways with new issues of the day. The historian of technology Paul Edwards, for example, in his book on Cold War computing (_The Closed World_) would probably also note that the idea of a \"Green World\" is in some very interesting ways the direct counterpart and antithesis to the hyper-controlled technoscience notion of the Closed World enabled by computing; in a sort of Hegelian sense, the ascent of one gives birth to the other.

{"original_text": "As you likely know, The Schlieffen Plan was the German army\u2019s plan for war against France and Russia. It was inspired by the Carthaginian envelopment of the Romans at the Battle of Cannae in 216 BC during the Second Punic War. Hannibal's troops, though fewer in numbers, used speed to outflank and then surround the Romans, who suffered one of their worst defeats every. The Germans believed they could use those tactics to defeat France, their traditional enemy. The German Chief of Staff Alfred von Schlieffen was the plans architect and in 1903 drafted the plan at the request of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Schlieffen faced a serious problem. Germany was not threatened by one enemy; rather, it had France in the west and Russia in the east. The mighty empires were allies and Germany would have to quickly defeat one while holding off the other. Key to success would be speed. To accelerate the transfer of troops between future fronts, Schlieffen advised the Kaiser to build efficient railroads to move troops quickly between the fronts. The Germans believed Russia would be slow to act, and minimal forces could hold them in check. The problem with France was the approach of the attack. The most viable route was through Belgium but this would violate Belgian neutrality and trigger an old treaty of protection between Belgium and England dating back to the Napoleonic era. The Germans believed they could advance rapidly before England could act. The timeline for victory was six weeks. In 1906, Helmuth von Moltke the Younger succeeded Schlieffen as Chief of the German General Staff. He had doubts about the possibility of a German victory in a great European war. He worried that France might use tactical withdrawals and not offer the grand battle Germany wanted, thereby leading to a conflict of attrition. As time went by, Moltke tweaked the plan. Deciding to honor Dutch neutrality, the German armies would have to squeeze the 600,000 men through a gap 12 miles wide, which made it vital that the Belgian railways were captured quickly and intact. In 1908, the General Staff devised a plan to take the Fortified Position of Li\u00e8ge and its railway junction by the 11th day of the attack. Later amendments accelerated the time to the 5th day, which meant that the attacking forces would need to get moving only hours after the that attack was launched. The Germans intended to intimidate the Belgian people using a scorched earth policy Instead of immediately surrendering, Belgium settled in for a long fight, delaying the German advance. In 1914, Germans advanced through Belgium and northern France against the Belgian, British and French armies and approximately 20 miles from Paris. They failed to envelop the Allied armies and force a decisive battle on them. The Germans outran their supplies, and the French rallied to stop the German advance, with a counter-offensive at the First Battle of the Marne, assisted by the British.

{"original_text": "First we should probably clarify that while the term \"Sakoku\" or \"closed country\" appears in many popular histories of Japan, it has fallen into some disfavour among academics on the subject. Instead the term \"kaikin\" or \"seaborne/maritime prohibitions\" is used to more accurately characterise the policies of the shoguns at the time. This isn't merely some technical squabbling over semantics, it impacts conclusions historians can reasonably draw about the reasons for the policy in the first place. It was not intended to destroy all international trade or even to actually completely isolate Japan from international affairs. Even early on, China acknowledged Japan as a potential threat due to its rapid adoption of many new ideas and technologies (Arthur Tiedermann, Modern Japan). So then, what were the reasons for trade, migration and cultural diffusion being so heavily restricted? 1) External factors caused by pressure from European colonial powers. European colonisation was among the world's most poorly kept secrets. The Spanish in the Philippines, the Dutch in Indonesia and pretty much everyone in China had all made efforts throughout the 16th and early 17th centuries to either wrangle ludicrously imbalanced trade deals, construct highly influential trading outposts or else outright invade and colonise. Empress Meisho is recorded as having expressed doubt as to the intentions of Europeans so it's known that those in Japanese elite circles certainly considered this a factor. 2) External factors relating to China. More modern research has made claims (at least somewhat supported) that Sakoku was a deliberate strategy by the shoguns to establish a firm presence for Japan in the geopolitics of East Asia that simultaneously allowed for contact with China, particularly through the Ryukyu Kingdom as a buffer state) while also maintaining independence from China (and particularly ruling out any kind of vassal state relationship) (Tashiro, Foreign Relations During the Edo Period). 3) Ideological reasons. Shogunate rule was quite conservative ideologically, with frequent reinforcement of feudal norms in the face of a changing society. In particular, this involved glorification of the agrarian lifestyle and honouring feudal relations such as those between peasant and landowner. Western norms presented challenges to this ideology, and there is some argument that Christianity, by its core beliefs, also challenged the supreme position of the shogun. It is difficult to determine how prominently this featured in the reasoning of the Bakufu, but the sheer level of destruction of any outside cultural influences suggests that it played some role in their logic. 4) Internal challenges to the shogunate. Despite this ideology, the shogun was by no means unassailable (as proven later with the Satsuma-Choshu alliance). Prominent daimyo presented significant threats to the status quo, with some growing exceedingly wealthy through international trade. By implementing Sakoku, all international trade was performed on the shogun's terms. This restriction on the activity of the daimyo was not unprecedented and definitely formed part of a deliberate strategy to centralise power under the shogun and government (Tiedemann again). 5) Internal threats from other classes. Christianity was being adopted quite rapidly by certain sectors of Japanese society, particularly the urban poor and parts of agrarian society. Compounded by other factors (drought, the development of urban centres, tax burdens) peasant uprisings became more frequent (such as the Shimabara Uprising). While not necessarily the fault of Christian beliefs, the fact that Christian peasants were challenging their daimyo nevertheless equated Western influence with challenge to authority (Laver, The Sakoku Edicts). So the shoguns certainly had many reasons to at least try Sakoku, but the question of whether it achieved its aims can be answered simply by looking at the fate of the shoguns. Stifling the intellectual development of the samurai, choking the wealth of the daimyo and ignoring potential external threats had the effect of galvanising Japan's elite (or at least a powerful section of it) to challenge the shogun and institute a new oligarchy in the Meiji Restoration. Its internal aims also failed to come to fruition with increasing peasant uprisings and dissent amongst Japan's growing and changing urban population. Nevertheless, for a substantial period Japan was able to protect complete depletion of its natural resources by the European powers. While the Sakoku period was certainly devastating to the shoguns in the long term, it was not entirely meritless. It followed a certain logic that, while it may not have benefited Japan as a whole, certainly had some sectional interests at its heart.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "First we should probably clarify that while the term \"Sakoku\" or \"closed country\" appears in many popular histories of Japan, it has fallen into some disfavour among academics on the subject.

Even early on, China acknowledged Japan as a potential threat due to its rapid adoption of many new ideas and technologies (Arthur Tiedermann, Modern Japan). So then, what were the reasons for trade, migration and cultural diffusion being so heavily restricted? 1) External factors caused by pressure from European colonial powers. European colonisation was among the world's most poorly kept secrets. The Spanish in the Philippines, the Dutch in Indonesia and pretty much everyone in China had all made efforts throughout the 16th and early 17th centuries to either wrangle ludicrously imbalanced trade deals, construct highly influential trading outposts or else outright invade and colonise. Empress Meisho is recorded as having expressed doubt as to the intentions of Europeans so it's known that those in Japanese elite circles certainly considered this a factor. 2) External factors relating to China. More modern research has made claims (at least somewhat supported) that Sakoku was a deliberate strategy by the shoguns to establish a firm presence for Japan in the geopolitics of East Asia that simultaneously allowed for contact with China, particularly through the Ryukyu Kingdom as a buffer state) while also maintaining independence from China (and particularly ruling out any kind of vassal state relationship) (Tashiro, Foreign Relations During the Edo Period). 3) Ideological reasons. Shogunate rule was quite conservative ideologically, with frequent reinforcement of feudal norms in the face of a changing society. In particular, this involved glorification of the agrarian lifestyle and honouring feudal relations such as those between peasant and landowner. Western norms presented challenges to this ideology, and there is some argument that Christianity, by its core beliefs, also challenged the supreme position of the shogun. It is difficult to determine how prominently this featured in the reasoning of the Bakufu, but the sheer level of destruction of any outside cultural influences suggests that it played some role in their logic. 4) Internal challenges to the shogunate. Despite this ideology, the shogun was by no means unassailable (as proven later with the Satsuma-Choshu alliance). Prominent daimyo presented significant threats to the status quo, with some growing exceedingly wealthy through international trade. By implementing Sakoku, all international trade was performed on the shogun's terms. This restriction on the activity of the daimyo was not unprecedented and definitely formed part of a deliberate strategy to centralise power under the shogun and government (Tiedemann again). 5) Internal threats from other classes. Christianity was being adopted quite rapidly by certain sectors of Japanese society, particularly the urban poor and parts of agrarian society. Compounded by other factors (drought, the development of urban centres, tax burdens) peasant uprisings became more frequent (such as the Shimabara Uprising). While not necessarily the fault of Christian beliefs, the fact that Christian peasants were challenging their daimyo nevertheless equated Western influence with challenge to authority (Laver, The Sakoku Edicts). So the shoguns certainly had many reasons to at least try Sakoku, but the question of whether it achieved its aims can be answered simply by looking at the fate of the shoguns. Stifling the intellectual development of the samurai, choking the wealth of the daimyo and ignoring potential external threats had the effect of galvanising Japan's elite (or at least a powerful section of it) to challenge the shogun and institute a new oligarchy in the Meiji Restoration. Its internal aims also failed to come to fruition with increasing peasant uprisings and dissent amongst Japan's growing and changing urban population. Nevertheless, for a substantial period Japan was able to protect complete depletion of its natural resources by the European powers. While the Sakoku period was certainly devastating to the shoguns in the long term, it was not entirely meritless. It followed a certain logic that, while it may not have benefited Japan as a whole, certainly had some sectional interests at its heart."}

{"original_text": "Med Student here: In order to answer your question thoroughly, I need to first explain some basics of the heart. When the heart beats, **it is designed to propel blood in a unidirectional manner.** Normally functioning heart valves, of which there are four, facilitate this unidirectional flow by preventing blood from traveling backwards. So how does this all work? For simplicity's sake, let\u2019s look at the left side of the heart alone. The two left chambers receive oxygenated blood from the lungs and deliver it to the body. This blood flows from the pulmonary veins into the first chamber, the left atrium, then out through the mitral valve and into the second chamber, the left ventricle, then out through the aortic valve and into the aorta, which delivers it to the body. **This process is called the \u2019cardiac cycle\u2019, and looks looks roughly like this:** 1. Both chambers are full of oxygenated blood 2. The small left atrium contracts first, \"topping off\" the left ventricle. 3. The large left ventricle contracts second, pumping its blood into systemic circulation. Meanwhile, the atrium is relaxing and refilling. 4. The left ventricle also relaxes and refills. Then the process repeats. **The purpose of the valves during this process is, as previously mentioned, to prevent backflow.** This means that the mitral valve, which prevents ventricular blood from being pumped back into the atrium, opens during 4 and closes at the end of 2. Similarly, the aortic valve, which prevents blood from the aorta back into the heart, opens at the beginning of 3 and closes at its end. So how do these valves open and close? It all has to do with pressure. Valves are designed a lot like most doors \u2013 they can only be pushed open from one side. If push from the wrong side, you can only keep the door shut. **In the heart, each valve is aligned so that increasing the pressure behind it acts to open the valve, while increasing the pressure in front of it acts to shut it**. Since the heart only ever pushes, never \u2018pulls\u2019, valve opening is dependent on which side of the \u2018door\u2019 is pushing harder. With that in mind, the sequential nature of contraction ensures that the contracting chamber is at a higher pressure (i.e. pushing harder) than the other. **Therefore, once blood in a chamber is pushed forwards, it shuts the valve (door) behind itself before moving forward again.** Now that you understand how valves work, let\u2019s look at how a leaking valve causes fatigue. It does so in two main ways: 1. **A'leaking valve' is a valve that fails to close properly.** In other words, when pressure increases on the downstream side of a leaking valve, **the valve allows some blood to flow backwards.** This process is called'*regurgitation*\" and it comes at the direct expense of blood traveling forwards; **blood is still pumped forwards, but not as much as intended.** To some degree, the heart can compensate for this drop in output by increasing the heart rate and the volume it pumps with each beat (stroke volume). However, when a large enough portion of the stroke volume ends up regurgitating (the regurgitant fraction), demand outstrips the heart's ability to supply the body with the nutrients and oxygen it needs, and symptoms appear. **Moreover, the stress of blood flowing backwards into the heart can overload and actually damage the heart muscle itself, further compromising its pumping ability.** **The resulting chronic insufficient bloodflow (perfusion), primarily to the brain, is responsible for the symptoms of fatigue, sleepiness, and difficulty concentrating.** Moreover, people with a regurgitant valve can also have more acute problems, like fainting (syncope), difficulty breathing (dyspnea), and chest pain (angina pectoris) with activities like exercising, or even just standing up - the heart can't keep up with increases in demand. 2. **A leaking heart valve also disrupts linear flow.** Normally blood passes through the heart in an orderly manner. When blood is allowed to regurgitate, it introduces all sorts of abnormal currents, much like eddy currents in a river. This abnormal, **turbulent flow can actually damage red blood cells as they pass.** Furthermore, a physically damaged valve can also kill or lyse red blood cells. This process can proceed to the point where **the patient becomes anemic** \u2013 they don\u2019t have enough red blood cells to carry the oxygen they need, which can contribute to the symptoms described above.

{"original_text": "All forms of myasthenia are due to problems in the communication between nerve cells and muscles. Most involve the activities of neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that allow neurons to relay information from one cell to the next. For neurotransmitters to be effective, the nerve cell must release the neurotransmitter properly, and the muscle cell must be able to detect the neurotransmitter and respond to its signal properly. The most common type of myasthenia, myasthenia gravis, is caused by an abnormal immune response in which antibodies block the ability of the muscle to detect the neurotransmitter. Congenital myasthenia, however, differs from myasthenia gravis because the disrupted communication isn't caused by antibodies, but by genetic defects. There are several different subtypes of congenital myasthenia, each the result of a specific genetic mutation. Since all types of myasthenia are due to the inability of nerves to trigger muscle activity, they all involve weakness, although there is some variability in the specific muscles affected. Symptoms of congenital myasthenia usually appear in the first few years of childhood, but may not be noticeable until much later, occasionally remaining unrecognized until adulthood. If the symptoms begin in infancy, they usually appear as \"floppiness\" and a failure to meet developmental milestones, such as rolling over or sitting up. Some infants may also have episodes of choking or pauses in breathing. If the symptoms begin in toddlers or preschool children, they appear as weakness during physical activities or an inability to perform ageappropriate actions, such as running or climbing. In addition, if eye muscles are involved, children may have droopy eyelids, \"lazy eye,\" or double vision. If mouth or throat muscles are involved, children may have difficulty speaking or swallowing. An important characteristic of myasthenia is that the weakness worsens during continuous activity, with strength returning, at least partially, after resting. Congenital myasthenia is an inherited (genetic) disorder. All but one known subtype are recessive disorders, which means that a child will have to have two copies of the abnormal gene (one from each parent) in order to develop the disease. To diagnose congenital myasthenia, a neurologist will test various muscles to determine if they grow weaker with repeated activity. The doctor will also test the electrical activity of nerves and muscles using electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction tests (NCS).

{"original_text": "Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. Don't wait for symptoms. Be sure to have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year to detect the disease before it causes damage to your vision. Vision Changes May Indicate Bleeding In the early stages of diabetic retinopathy, you may not notice any changes in your vision. But if diabetic retinopathy reaches its final stage, proliferative retinopathy, bleeding can occur. If this happens, at first, you will see a few specks of blood, or spots, floating in your vision.

{"original_text": "Hey there, /u/DoubleDgit. I'm off work now and can answer your question. In short, **fur trading.** I suggest Lydia Black's *Russians in Alaska: 1732-1867* as the best book on the Russian period in Alaska. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Russia expanded eastward through Siberia, setting up a system of fur-based tribute in which officials would gather furs from an area of Siberian Native villages. These officials were backed by the military, and in the middle 18th century, following the Russian discovery of Alaska, this practice moved into Alaska. By the end of the 18th century, there were several competing Russian trading companies in Alaska. These companies employed native Aleut and Alutiiq hunters to catch sea otters, whose furs were incredibly valuable in China. A type of triangular trade developed, whereby furs would be shipped from Alaska to China for sale. In China, traders would buy Chinese goods (porcelain for one) that would then be taken back to European Russia for sale. Proceeds from the sale would buy supplies for the Alaska operations and pay dividends to the trading companies' shareholders. This was an enormous undertaking operated by surprisingly few Russians. At no point in the Russian period (1732-1867) were there more than 1,000 Russians in Alaska. Most of the work in Alaska was performed by Natives, and in the beginning, they were coerced to hunt furs through extraordinarily violent methods. Massacre, hostage-taking, and attacks on competitors were common. So bad was the situation that Catherine the Great felt that something had to be done to prevent the mistreatment of Natives. She issued several orders calling for fair treatment, but the biggest success (at the hands of her successor, Emperor Paul) was the establishment of the Russian-American Company, a monopoly with trading power over all of Alaska. This company was the successor to one of the most successful trading companies operating from Russia's Far East. Through three 20-year charters, the RAC operated with a single mission: Make money. There was no drive toward settlement, no effort to establish towns, as there was in the British and French territories. Russia had all of Siberia to settle, after all, and Alaska was first and foremost a money-making opportunity. There were only such settlements as were needed to support the fur trade. As time went on, Russian America started to change. Intermarriage between Russians and Natives (plus Natives who Russianized) created a Creole class that willingly worked for the RAC, often to great success. Alaska Natives attended navigation colleges in European Russia, attended Russian churches and shopped in Russian stores. The fur trade changed as well. The triangular trade turned square as Americans arrived on the Pacific Coast of North America. It was much cheaper to buy supplies (and they were much more reliable in arriving) from California instead of Russia proper. Before the Americans took over the Pacific Coast, the Russians even tried establishing an agricultural colony in California as a way to supply their holdings farther north. Called Fort Ross, this colony was never as successful as planned, and it was sold a few years before the California Gold Rush. The Russians attempted to diversify their fur-trading operations, but were never successful. American and British whalers filled the waters south and west of Alaska, but the Russo-Finnish Whaling Company of the 1850s was a commercial failure. Gold, though known to exist in an unknown quantity, was not exploited, and neither was coal. In fact, the biggest commercial success was ice. Shipments of ice (starting in the 1850s) were undertaken regularly between the Kodiak archipelago and San Francisco. Despite the distances involved, despite all the problems of a remote colony, the Russian American Company stayed largely profitable until the 1867 Alaska Purchase Treaty.

{"original_text": "Poland definitely was a nation with an aggressive doctrine in its actions. This was largely due to the actions of Josef Pilsudski, the Marshal and military leader of Poland. --- Here is a pure timeline: * 1918: With the target of creating a greater Polish superstate, sometimes referred to in historical writing as *Intermarium*, sometimes *Mi\u0119dzymorze* (Latin/Polish for \"between the seas\"), war breaks out between Poland and the Soviet Russian and Soviet Ukrainian Republics (back then, they were legally not yet the USSR), as well as various Ukrainian states, with the Soviets currently fighting the Russian Civil War. The war will see initial Polish success (Pilsudski's Kiev Offensive), then Soviet success, then Polish success again. In 1921, the war ends in a military stalemate, but with Polish territorial gains in the east. * January 1919: After a series of political and diplomatic conflicts along the disputed Cieszyn (Teschen) Silesia area, Czechoslovak units attack Polish lines. As the Polish military was distracted, Czechoslovakia gained the advantage and, eventually, control of the region. Not the \"fault\" of Poland per se, but still a direct result of their unwillingness to step down in the territorial conflict. To be fair, neither did the Czechoslovaks. * June of 1919: Poland is in diplomatic conflict with the United States and their president, Woodrow Wilson. He basically forces upon them the protection of their national minorities, which make up maybe a third of the country's population. Poland is unhappy, as neighboring Weimar Germany with its Polish minority was not forced to sign such a treaty.

The war will see initial Polish success (Pilsudski's Kiev Offensive), then Soviet success, then Polish success again. In 1921, the war ends in a military stalemate, but with Polish territorial gains in the east. * January 1919: After a series of political and diplomatic conflicts along the disputed Cieszyn (Teschen) Silesia area, Czechoslovak units attack Polish lines. As the Polish military was distracted, Czechoslovakia gained the advantage and, eventually, control of the region. Not the \"fault\" of Poland per se, but still a direct result of their unwillingness to step down in the territorial conflict. To be fair, neither did the Czechoslovaks. * June of 1919: Poland is in diplomatic conflict with the United States and their president, Woodrow Wilson. He basically forces upon them the protection of their national minorities, which make up maybe a third of the country's population.

{"original_text": "Well, this is a case of hindsight being 20/20. To modern observers, Lincoln\u2019s reelection looks like a landslide, but in the Spring and Summer of 1864, things didn\u2019t look quite as good for Lincoln\u2019s potential second term. For starters, the momentum the Union had gained after the one-two punch of the victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg had evaporated with Sherman\u2019s stall in front of Atlanta (he didn\u2019t take the city until September 2nd). In the weeks leading up to the eventual capture, Sherman had maneuvered Confederate General Joe Johnston into a series of strategic retreats, but the finishing blow eluded the Union commander. Lincoln was desperate for good news out west, yet Sherman failed to give the president a resounding victory until just a month before the presidential election. In the east, although Grant had begun his campaign against Lee with high expectations (from himself, his staff, the president, the president\u2019s cabinet, the press, and the public at large), he also failed to achieve a resounding breakthrough or victory. Although Grant and the Army of the Potomac fought bravely, and stole a couple of marches on Lee, the Army of Northern Virginia always seemed just a half step or so ahead, and were dug in before the Union forces could assemble and attack. Bloody repulses in The Wilderness, Cold Harbor, and Spotsylvania Courthouse made for bad headlines, and despite the fact that Grant was backing Lee further and further up against Richmond, the progress was slow (and bloody). The one exception to this narrative was in front of Petersburg, yet Grant and Meade\u2019s army weren\u2019t able to exploit their flanking maneuver to take the city (so it settled into a siege). Further south, Gen. Butler got himself bottled up in the Bermuda Hundred Campaign, so during the summer of 1864, you had Grant stalled in front of Petersburg, Butler bottled up even further south, and Sherman unable to land a killing blow out west. The grand strategy to hit the Confederacy all at once in a series of coordinated attacks seemed like yet another blunder by Union forces unable to contend with the hardscrabble Confederate forces. Politically, Lincoln faced a number of challenges, both from the outside and within. He had a member of his own cabinet, Chase, angling for the Republican nomination (this didn\u2019t amount to much, but it was a disheartening development that Lincoln had to deal with), and he had a VERY popular general, McClellan, running on the Democrat ticket. Lincoln had every reason to worry that McClellan might split or even win the votes of the soldiers who made no secret of their love of the guy, and with the Union war effort stalled on every front, there was definitely reason to worry about reelection prospects. On top of all this, there was Copperhead agitation (which, again, didn\u2019t amount to much, but seemed like a big issue at the time), which was angling for peace talks, and a resolution of the conflict by way of negotiation. Lincoln had already committed to the prospect of a complete Union, unfractured, and was on record as saying that he would never, as president, rescind his Emancipation Proclamation (which would have certainly been a plank in the Confederate negotiation process). So the \"peace\" candidate was looking to negotiate a peace, almost certainly with a view towards rescinding Emancipation and negotiating with the Confederacy to allow them some level of autonomy, or at the very least, to allow them to dictate the grounds of Reconstruction. So to sum up, the military situation didn\u2019t look great, Lincoln\u2019s political prospects were up in the air, and domestically, there was a vocal minority pushing for a negotiated peace (which ran counter to everything Lincoln stood for). Ultimately, Sherman\u2019s capture of Atlanta was a HUGE boon to the Union\u2019s military prospects, McClellan wasn\u2019t nearly as popular with the troops as had been expected (they voted overwhelmingly for Lincoln), and the political agitation kicked up by Chase and the Copperheads never amounted to anything. Once Grant cornered Lee in Petersburg, it became clear to most that Lee\u2019s army was effectively in check and used up so that by the time the election rolled around, it seemed insane to vote against a continued pursuit of total victory, which was still a ways off, but looking much better in the fall than it did in the summer.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Well, this is a case of hindsight being 20/20.

In most contemporary Western cultures, religion is not all-encompassing. If you're asked to describe yourself, your religion isn't necessarily the first thing to comes to mind. However, in the 19th century, when Marx was writing, religion played a much larger role in peoples' lives. Religions bound people together and tore people apart in 19th century Europe. In the UK, for example, some were poor and some were rich, but everyone was an Anglican, which gave people a sense of unity. Meanwhile, over in Ireland, everyone was a Catholic, which to many Brits gave them a good reason to rule Ireland. Now, to a contemporary viewer, these might have just seemed to be the effects of nationalism, but Marx didn't see it that way. To Marx, history and everything in history was all about who held power, and to him, religion was just another way that the Bourgeoisie could oppress the Proletariat. For instance, when Marx saw all people of all classes participating in a common religion, he viewed it as a trick by the rich to pacify the working class with false promises of a better life after death. In this way, religion reinforced the status quo by fooling the poor into doing whatever the rich wanted. Meanwhile, Marx also saw religion as an imperialist force. I mentioned earlier that European powers often used their religion as an excuse to colonize foreign lands. Well Marx saw this as another move by the rich to gain more economic resources to increase profits. Meanwhile, the colonies would suffer increasing poverty under the rule of European powers and the Bourgeoisie would get ever richer. So, in short, Marx saw religion as a tool used by the rich to take advantage of the poor by fooling them into thinking that the afterlife would make up for their mortal suffering. Meanwhile, he also believed that the elite used religion as an excuse to colonize and exploit foreign nations for personal benefit.

There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. There is no staging system for hydatidiform moles. The following stages are used for GTN: Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV The treatment of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia is based on the type of disease, stage, or risk group. After gestational trophoblastic neoplasia has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer has spread from where it started to other parts of the body. The process used to find out the extent or spread of cancer is called staging, The information gathered from the staging process helps determine the stage of disease. For GTN, stage is one of the factors used to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be done to help find out the stage of the disease: Chest xray: An xray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body onto film, making pictures of areas inside the body. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium: A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Lumbar puncture: A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if choriocarcinoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually choriocarcinoma cells. The disease is metastatic choriocarcinoma, not lung cancer. There is no staging system for hydatidiform moles. Hydatidiform moles (HM) are found in the uterus only and do not spread to other parts of the body. The following stages are used for GTN: Stage I In stage I, the tumor is in the uterus only. Stage II In stage II, cancer has spread outside of the uterus to the ovary, fallopian tube, vagina, and/or the ligaments that support the uterus. Stage III In stage III, cancer has spread to the lung. Stage IV In stage IV, cancer has spread to distant parts of the body other than the lungs. The treatment of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia is based on the type of disease, stage, or risk group. Invasive moles and choriocarcinomas are treated based on risk groups. The stage of the invasive mole or choriocarcinoma is one factor used to determine risk group. Other factors include the following: The age of the patient when the diagnosis is made. Whether the GTN occurred after a molar pregnancy, miscarriage, or normal pregnancy. How soon the tumor was diagnosed after the pregnancy began. The level of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the blood. The size of the largest tumor. Where the tumor has spread to and the number of tumors in the body. How many chemotherapy drugs the tumor has been treated with (for recurrent or resistant tumors). There are two risk groups for invasive moles and choriocarcinomas: low risk and high risk. Patients with lowrisk disease usually receive less aggressive treatment than patients with highrisk disease.

{"original_text": "It's incredibly selective and biased. I'm going to take on two points in particular. The entire Chinese resettlement part is blatantly untrue and incredibly dishonest. The Malayan Emergency (1948-1960) is still to this day seen as the textbook example of a successful counterinsurgency. The British, with a co-ordinated and adapted strategy to local conditions, managed to defeat a communist insurgency based out of the Chinese minority in Malaya. The rural portion of the Chinese minority in Malaya, those targeted for resettlement which I will speak about in a broader context in a moment, lived as squatters on the fringes of the jungle and thus occupied land illegally. Due to the poor conditions (and the fact that many of these families either had a direct or semi-direct relationship with someone in the communist insurgency), they were a breeding ground for recruits and vital supplies for the insurgents. At the beginning of the Malayan Emergency, there was no real sign that a proper (modern) counterinsurgency strategy was ever forthcoming. Colonial policing was far more on the schedule and conventional tactics more akin to colonial warfare were used in the form of large search and destroy sweeps and a very heavy-handed approach towards the local population. The soldiers involved had no experience in fighting insurgencies nor were they trained for it, which led to such atrocities as the Batan Kali massacre in 1948 - typical of the sort of atrocities committed by forces more focused on killing insurgents than trying to win over the population to their side. As anyone can imagine, this certainly did not led to any results and it alienated the population away from British efforts to gain their trust. By 1950, it was recognized that the strategy had to be revised. This came first in the Briggs plan (named after Lieutenant General Sir Harold Briggs, Director of Operations) which pushed forward the concept of a counterinsurgency focused on the population. That meant that the population had to not only be separated from the insurgents (and thus denying the insurgents a base of support) but also to provide them with safety by continuous presence by police and military forces. The Briggs plan also pushed for more administration strength as well as overall co-ordination between both military and civilian administration. These were all good ideas and when put into practice, it did not all turned out well. The resettlement was done poorly, heavy-handed approaches by the police and military was still happening and an overall co-ordination was still not fully completed. As they say, Rome wasn't built in a day and it is important to mark the Briggs Plan as a foundation for what would come next. The first step was to get an individual to both command the military and civilian administration. That man was Lieutenant General Sir Gerald Templer. Templer's approach mirrored that of what we could call a modern counterinsurgency approach: population-centric with a focus on hearts and minds. He wanted to win the population over by winning their'hearts and minds'. This meant no more heavy-handed approaches or cultural insensitivities. The police was given proper training, resettlement to what was to be called the'Model Villages' were carried out in a far more efficient and humane way than under Briggs and more importantly, these villages began to be provided with medical facilities, schools, clean water, access to the outside world through roads etc., as well as jobs or their own land which the resettled population could cultivate. This not only made them feel more like citizens but also like they had something to lose by supporting the insurgents. This, in combination with increased security by native police, made it very effective. At the same time, the military forces kept the pressure on the insurgents with the use of smaller, more mobile units who with the help of intelligence now openly provided by a safe and supportive population were able to set up ambushes or hunt insurgents down directly. With the removal of food supplies, the insurgents began to starve and many surrendered. The final death blow came in the form of socio-economic and political reforms which ultimately led to the independence of Malaya in 1957. There were other local conditions which made it easier for the British to combat these insurgents however: Malaya received an economic boost due to the Korean War (1950-53), the insurgency was localized to the visible Chinese minority and the insurgents had no safe haven over the border with Thailand, making it difficult to gain equipment and supplies. Many rightfully point at the Malayan Emergency as the birth of the Hearts and Mind theory and it is still rightfully looked at with admiration. The idea that the resettlement policy was racist is absurd: The Malayan Chinese made up a majority of the MCP (Malayan Communist Party) and they specifically targeted the Chinese minority for support.

{"original_text": "Yes, this is the case. It's not the only thing that was common in many recent wars, though. As Walzer notes in *Just and Unjust Wars*, soldiers have often hesitated in situations that weren't just medics. While the Geneva Convention mentioned goes into detail about how medics are to be respected, soldiers have hesitated (at least, as he notes, during some wars) to shoot enemies who are in strange circumstances as well. He notes five different examples. The first, found in a letter from poet from Wilfred Owen to his brother in 1917, details how his group stumbled upon a solitary German \"...haring along toward us, with his head down and his arms stretched in front of him, as if he were going to take a high dive through the earth...Nobody offered to shoot him, he looked too funny...\" The second is found in Robert Graves' autobiography, where he detailed how he \"...disliked the idea of shooting a naked man\", handed off his rifle, and let someone else kill him. The third is found in George Orwell recounting the Spanish Civil War and his work as a sniper in the forward position in the republican lines. He says he did not shoot \"...partly because of that detail about the trousers\", where he said the man was \"...half-dressed and holding up his trousers with both hands as he ran\". The fourth is by Raleigh Trevelyan, a British soldier in WWII, who said in a published \"Diary of Anzio\" that he saw \"An individual, dressed in German uniform, was wandering like a sleep-walker across our line of fire. It was clear that for the moment he had forgotten war and--as we had been doing--was reveling in the promise of warmth and spring\". They chose to scare him away rather than kill him. The fifth example is an account by Emilio Lussu, who fought the Austrians (he was an Italian) in WWI. He watched the Austrians having morning coffee from a position overlooking their trenches, and said he had a lot of trouble shooting at a man who had been smoking a cigarette, and eventually gave up trying to.

In this sense, the Geneva Convention makes perfect sense, as does the refrain from shooting medics purposely.

{"original_text": "So I can answer this a bit plainly here. It's a little yes and a whole lot more no. The reasoning behind this is purely in terms of American pressure and the fact of the matter most if not all of South America relied heavily on US goods for many purposes. Albeit I'll point out under Getulio Vargas there was a lot of push to more actively industrialize Brazil. This however does not make up for the disparity in industrial capability between USA and pretty much the entire South American continent. There simply isn't a comparison to be made here. The USA was so utterly superior in industrial capability that it would be no contest even with the USA being unprepared conventionally against countries like Germany (the US army was more or less operating on an extremely low tier until the first drafts brought the army into respected size and capability) Given the disparity that didn't stop Germany from invading pretty much all of Europe! Which I've heard as the big retort against this. Well first of all Germany was still an industrial giant whereas nothing in South America was even close to performing or manufacturing the same amount of equipment the Germans did. There simply isn't enough industry or even manpower (Brazil the only thing that could be considered a competitor under the most ideal conditions) had 40 someodd million people to the USAs 120 million). To me this definitely seems like a recipe for disaster if they joined the Axis. Regardless of political leanings the South American counties simply lacked pretty much everything they needed to fight war on that scale. Before this the largest war south America had ever seen was the Paraguayan war which was devastating but pretty much every single side in that conflict performed absolutely poorly. So without a big military tradition, industrial capability, manpower, or equipment everyone wisely pulled together that it would be suicide to fight the Allies specifically since joining the Axis would almost certainly look like a violation of the Monroe doctrine to the Americans. If anything it would probably force America into the war earlier! The real meat of it though is it simply would be so much more beneficial for the South American countries to profit off of helping the United States and the Allies in the long run.

The reasoning behind this is purely in terms of American pressure and the fact of the matter most if not all of South America relied heavily on US goods for many purposes. Albeit I'll point out under Getulio Vargas there was a lot of push to more actively industrialize Brazil. This however does not make up for the disparity in industrial capability between USA and pretty much the entire South American continent. There simply isn't a comparison to be made here. The USA was so utterly superior in industrial capability that it would be no contest even with the USA being unprepared conventionally against countries like Germany (the US army was more or less operating on an extremely low tier until the first drafts brought the army into respected size and capability) Given the disparity that didn't stop Germany from invading pretty much all of Europe! Which I've heard as the big retort against this. Well first of all Germany was still an industrial giant whereas nothing in South America was even close to performing or manufacturing the same amount of equipment the Germans did. There simply isn't enough industry or even manpower (Brazil the only thing that could be considered a competitor under the most ideal conditions) had 40 someodd million people to the USAs 120 million). To me this definitely seems like a recipe for disaster if they joined the Axis. Regardless of political leanings the South American counties simply lacked pretty much everything they needed to fight war on that scale. Before this the largest war south America had ever seen was the Paraguayan war which was devastating but pretty much every single side in that conflict performed absolutely poorly. So without a big military tradition, industrial capability, manpower, or equipment everyone wisely pulled together that it would be suicide to fight the Allies specifically since joining the Axis would almost certainly look like a violation of the Monroe doctrine to the Americans. If anything it would probably force America into the war earlier! The real meat of it though is it simply would be so much more beneficial for the South American countries to profit off of helping the United States and the Allies in the long run.

{"original_text": "After ovarian germ cell tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. The following stages are used for ovarian germ cell tumors: Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV After ovarian germ cell tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body. The process used to find out whether cancer has spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. Unless a doctor is sure the cancer has spread from the ovaries to other parts of the body, an operation called a laparotomy is done to see if the cancer has spread. The doctor must cut into the abdomen and carefully look at all the organs to see if they have cancer in them. The doctor will cut out small pieces of tissue so they can be checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. The doctor may also wash the abdominal cavity with fluid, which is also checked under a microscope to see if it has cancer cells in it. Usually the doctor will remove the cancer and other organs that have cancer in them during the laparotomy. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Many of the tests used to diagnose ovarian germ cell tumor are also used for staging. The following tests and procedures may also be used for staging: PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Transvaginal ultrasound exam: A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and bladder. An ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The doctor can identify tumors by looking at the sonogram. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor. For example, if an ovarian germ cell tumor spreads to the liver, the tumor cells in the liver are actually cancerous ovarian germ cells. The disease is metastatic ovarian germ cell tumor, not liver cancer. The following stages are used for ovarian germ cell tumors: Stage I In stage I, cancer is found in one or both ovaries. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IC. Stage IA: Cancer is found inside a single ovary. Stage IB: Cancer is found inside both ovaries. Stage IC: Cancer is found inside one or both ovaries and one of the following is true: cancer is also found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries; or the capsule (outer covering) of the ovary has ruptured (broken open); or cancer cells are found in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity (the body cavity that contains most of the organs in the abdomen) or in washings of the peritoneum (tissue lining the peritoneal cavity). Stage II In stage II, cancer is found in one or both ovaries and has spread into other areas of the pelvis. Stage II is divided into stage IIA, stage IIB, and stage IIC. Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to the uterus and/or fallopian tubes (the long slender tubes through which eggs pass from the ovaries to the uterus). Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to other tissue within the pelvis. Stage IIC: Cancer is found inside one or both ovaries and has spread to the uterus and/or fallopian tubes, or to other tissue within the pelvis.

Stage III In stage III, cancer is found in one or both ovaries and has spread outside the pelvis to other parts of the abdomen and/or nearby lymph nodes. Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC. Stage IIIA: The tumor is found in the pelvis only, but cancer cells that can be seen only with a microscope have spread to the surface of the peritoneum (tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers most of the organs in the abdomen), the small intestines, or the tissue that connects the small intestines to the wall of the abdomen. Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the peritoneum and the cancer in the peritoneum is 2 centimeters or smaller. Stage IIIC: Cancer has spread to the peritoneum and the cancer in the peritoneum is larger than 2 centimeters and/or cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the abdomen. Cancer that has spread to the surface of the liver is also considered stage III ovarian cancer.

More information about the use of genetic carrier testing is available on GeneTests' Web site and can be viewed by clicking here. Individuals who are interested in learning about genetic testing and about their specific risk to be a carrier should speak with a genetics professional."}

{"original_text": "First, I have to point out that that chart is overly simplistic. There are at least eight distinct systems I know about, between ancient and modern, Jewish and Christian. There is no unified \"Protestant\" version; in fact, Lutherans use a numbering and division more similar to the Catholic one than to other Protestants. As to your question about dissent within the \"Protestant church,\" the answer is clearly yes, and doubly so because there was never a single unified Protestant church. The Western tradition that the Catholics and Lutherans mostly share goes back, as does much of their theology, to Augustine, Bishop of Hippo in the late 300s/early 400s. The twist that this chart calls \"Protestant\" (and is indeed used by many Protestants of different traditions) comes, to the best of my knowledge, from John Calvin, in his *Institutes of the Christian Religion*, where he cites concern for clearly proclaiming the prohibition against idolatry and graven images as the reason: > There is no room for controversy as to the fact, that the Law is divided into ten heads since this is repeatedly sanctioned by divine authority. The question, therefore, is not as to the number of the parts, but the method of dividing them. Those who adopt a division which gives three commandments to the First Table, and throws the remaining seven into the Second Table, expunge the commandment concerning images from the list, or at least conceal it under the first, though there cannot be a doubt that it was distinctly set down by the Lord as a separate commandment; whereas the tenth, which prohibits the coveting of what belongs to our neighbour, they absurdly break down into two. Institutes, chapter 8, section 12. Now, Calvin studies is not my strength, and the *Institutes* went through a large number of editions from 1536 through 1559, so I'm afraid I can't speak confidently as to when that dates within that range. Already in his 1545 Geneva Catechism, Calvin has changed the numbering away from the traditional Catholic/Lutheran system, so I feel comfortable thinking it may be from an earlier edition of *Institutes*.

{"original_text": "How might chronic fatigue syndrome be treated? Treatment options for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are limited.[9440] Treatment is largely supportive and is focused on the specific symptoms present in each individual. In most cases, symptoms of CFS lessen over time. Many therapies have been tried, but only cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy reportedly appear to produce meaningful benefit. CBT typically involves a series of onehour sessions designed to alter beliefs and behaviors that might delay recovery. Graded exercise therapy can be beneficial because prolonged lack of exercise may worsen the symptoms of the condition and should be discouraged.[9440] Gradual introduction of regular aerobic exercise, such as walking, swimming, cycling, or jogging, under close medical supervision may reduce fatigue and improve physical function. The goal is to have 30 minutes of light exercise five times a week. To avoid overexertion it is recommended to set a target heart rate range, generally <100 beats per minute. Graded exercise should be always supervised by a physical therapist or exercise therapist. In some studies, women with this condition were found to have low normal fitness on treadmill testing with no indication of heart or lung problems. Maximal testing did not result in worse fatigue or other symptoms. Because many people who have CFS are also depressed, treating the depression can make it easier to cope with the problems associated with CFS. Low doses of some antidepressants may help improve sleep and relieve pain.[6269] A number of medications, special diets and vitamin supplements have been evaluated in individuals with CFS, but none have been proven effective. Although there have been a number of viruses that were initially reported to cause CFS, additional studies have not proven this.[9440] Trials of antiviral agents have been ineffective in relieving the symptoms of CFS.

Many therapies have been tried, but only cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy reportedly appear to produce meaningful benefit. CBT typically involves a series of onehour sessions designed to alter beliefs and behaviors that might delay recovery. Graded exercise therapy can be beneficial because prolonged lack of exercise may worsen the symptoms of the condition and should be discouraged.[9440] Gradual introduction of regular aerobic exercise, such as walking, swimming, cycling, or jogging, under close medical supervision may reduce fatigue and improve physical function. The goal is to have 30 minutes of light exercise five times a week. To avoid overexertion it is recommended to set a target heart rate range, generally <100 beats per minute. Graded exercise should be always supervised by a physical therapist or exercise therapist. In some studies, women with this condition were found to have low normal fitness on treadmill testing with no indication of heart or lung problems. Maximal testing did not result in worse fatigue or other symptoms. Because many people who have CFS are also depressed, treating the depression can make it easier to cope with the problems associated with CFS. Low doses of some antidepressants may help improve sleep and relieve pain.[6269] A number of medications, special diets and vitamin supplements have been evaluated in individuals with CFS, but none have been proven effective. Although there have been a number of viruses that were initially reported to cause CFS, additional studies have not proven this.[9440] Trials of antiviral agents have been ineffective in relieving the symptoms of CFS. Several clinical trials aiming to find effective treatment are currently ongoing."}

To begin with, the greased cartridges so often associated with the rebellion \u2013 which, as I am sure you are aware, were rumoured to be coated with pig or cow fat, making them anathema to Muslim and Hindu troops respectively \u2013 were a product of the East India Company's 1853 decision to upgrade the Brown Bess muskets issued to the majority of its troops in India ever since 1740 to the 1853 model Enfield Rifle. The ammunition issued for use with the Enfield comprised a paper cartridge containing both powder and bullet, and the rifle was loaded by, first, holding the rifle in one hand and the cartridge in the other, and then tearing open the cartridge with the teeth, pouring the powder into the barrel, and using a ramrod to push down the rest of the cartridge, still containing the bullet, into the barrel. In order to make it easier to insert the cartridge into the barrel, the paper was lubricated at one end with grease. It was the fact that the cartridges had to be placed in the sepoys' mouths that was the problem, since it was taboo for Muslims and Hindus to *eat* (and not merely to handle) any part of the flesh of pigs and cows. To do so would be a serious matter for men of either religion, since it resulted in the defiling of their ritual purity, and though it is true that exceptions could be, and were, made by the local religious authorities in cases in which pollution was either accidental or a result of necessity \u2013 for example, occurring in action against an enemy \u2013 the British certainly were aware that the type of grease used was an issue. Samples of the new cartridges that had been made and greased in Britain were sent to India in 1853, and although they were never actually used \u2013 LeClair explains that they were intended > for handling and climate tests.... but *not* for firing trials. The ammunition either stayed in storage at the arsenals, or packets were placed in cartridge pouches carried by Indian guards to see how the cartridges stood up to daily handling. In 1855, the entire batch returned to England. \u2013 it does appear that the appearance of the new ammunition did worry at least one official in India. A warning about the possible consequences of issuing cartridges greased with pig or cow fat was, in fact, sent to the EIC's Military Board in 1853. Now, it is incontestable that a rumour that suggested the grease used incorporated pig and cow fat did spread among Indian troops stationed at the major EIC base at Meerut, in northern India, from January 1857, and that this was a significant factor in the events that triggered the Indian uprising in May of that year. Exactly why the sepoys became so alarmed, and what information they received about the grease, is, however, much less certain. Accounts written at the time suggested that the origin of the rumour was a dispute between a low-caste labourer and some sepoys of the highest \u2013 Brahmin \u2013 caste over access to drinking water at the EIC base at Dum Dum. Wagner notes that > the story of how the rumour actually came about was later to be endlessly repeated: allegedly a *khalasi* or labourer of low caste, who worked at the depot, asked a *sepoy* of the 2nd Bengal Native Infantry for some water from the soldiers *lota* or drinking vessel. Brahmins and high-caste Hindus always carried a *lota* so that they could drink water anywhere without having to bring to their mouth anything that might have been polluted by the touch of a person from a lower caste. The *sepoy* indignantly declined the inappropriate request, and the *khalasi* responded: \u2018You will soon lose your caste, as ere long you will have to bite the cartridges covered with the fat of pigs and cows.\u2019 Nonetheless, the reality \u2013 which emerged only much later, as the result of a detailed reinvestigation of the problem carried out after the rebellion had been quashed \u2013 is that we simply don't know what the grease was made of. This is because its production had in fact always been handed in what was \u2013 in retrospect \u2013 an alarmingly casual and \"hands-off\" way, even in the UK, where as LeClair explains, the grease mixture used was stated, in spectacularly vague terms, to comprise > common grease.... laboratory grease.... Belgian grease.... and Hoffman's Grease, in each case with the admixture of creosote and tobacco. This was a longstanding problem which the EIC had had plenty of time to address, but had failed to, and this failure can really only be attributed to the fact that at least some of the officers nominally responsible simply did not care about Indian religious proscriptions, and saw them, at best as superstition, and at worst as idolatry. Thus Wagner points out that the grease used on two models of rifle issued to Indian skirmishers before 1853 \"was supposed to be composed of linseed oil and beeswax,\" but that in fact \"it appears that various other types of lubricant were also used, including mutton-fat, wax, and coconut oil.\" A similarly casual attitude was also taken to the grease produced for the the 1853 model cartridges, which was made in India not under careful supervision in the official EIC arsenal, but by an Indian subcontractor, Gangadarh Banerji & Co. The instructions issued to this Indian owned- and operated firm by the Enfield firm stated that the grease was to be made of beeswax and tallow \u2013 which is animal fat. Enfield's instructions \u2013 which it appears had originally been written to be issued to British firms producing cartridges for British troops in the UK \u2013 simply did not specify what type of animal fat was to be used. Despite the warning issued in 1853, the senior officers at the arsenal, who were led by Inspector-General of Ordnance Augustus Abbott, did not bother to concern themselves with anything so mundane as the precise constituents of grease, and the man whose job it was to do so \u2013 one Lieutenant Curry, the junior officer responsible for actually obtaining the grease at the Commissary of Ordnance in the main EIC arsenal at Fort William, Kolkata \u2013 was likewise apparently indifferent to what exactly went on at Gangadarh Banerji & Co. Curry's post-rebellion evidence to a court of inquiry was this: > Q: You stated in your evidence on Saturday, that before the 27th January, cartridges were issued to the Delhi magazine from the arsenal, already greased; what are the orders you have received on the composition of grease for the use of cartridges? > > A: The grease was to be made of six parts of tallow and one part of bees-wax. > > Q: Of what ought that tallow to consist? > > A: No inquiry is made as to the fat of what animal is used. > > Q: You do not yourself know what fat is used? > > A: No, I don\u2019t know. > > Q: Is not the intention of Government that the tallow to be used in the preparation of grease should be mutton or goats fat? > > A: It is *not* the intention of Government that all grease used in any preparation in the magazine is to be made of goat\u2019s and sheep's fat only.

No one has ever looked, but a year at that would certainly be lethal. The only thing I'm not sure about is if the pulmonary edema would kill you first, or the CNS toxicity would kill you first. I lean to the pulmonary edema. Also, the girl would be seriously \"narc'ed\". At high partial pressures of nitrogen (pN2), she'd experience nitrogen narcosis, which is pretty much like being drunk.

Uses helium instead of nitrogen after a certain amount of time, and keeps the pO2 at atmospheric. The solubility of a gas in a liquid goes up with increasing pressure. You see this when you buy a 2L bottle of Coke. Squeeze the bottle...you can feel that it's pressurized. Look at the liquid...there are no bubbles. Now open the cap. You hear the pressure coming off and can feel the bottle start to give a little...there's no more pressure. Also, you see bubbles start to form in the liquid.

{"original_text": "We have piecemeal information from historical and archaeological sources. It changed over time from a loosely organized hegemonic power to a centralized state with a large bureaucracy. **Before the Empire** Prior to the formation of the empire, P'ur\u00e9pecha governments were organized around units roughly equivalent to city-states. The indigenous term, according to Gilberti (1983) is *ireta*, and the ruler was known as the *irecha*. Each ireta was composed of smaller units variously called \"barrios,\" wards, districts, or neighborhoods. The indigenous term for these units was *uap\u00e1tzequa* (singular), or uapatz\u00e9quecha (plural) (Gilberti 1983; Van Zantwijk 1967). The uap\u00e1tzequa was a political unit below the larger city-state government that included both nobles and commoners. Membership in them was likely hereditary (it is among modern P'ur\u00e9pecha, see Van Zantwijk 1967). Lesser levels of the nobility may have been heads of the *uapan\u00e9quecha*. A key insight made by some colonial administrators in the *Relaciones Geogr\u00e1ficas* is that the P'ur\u00e9pecha, like the Aztecs, may not have differentiated between rural and urban components of city-states. So a *uap\u00e1tzequa* may be a neighborhood within a city, or a suburb, or a completely separate town on the outskirts of the city's territory. Regardless, each had its own local council that managed local affairs such as marriages between residents or land disputes. Smaller informal subdivisions likely also existed within the larger neighborhood-level units. Additionally, there were also likely some form of trade guilds that managed the production of certain crafts like stone masons and the weaving of reed mats. These kinds of organizations exist today within modern P'ur\u00e9pecha villages (Van Zantwijk 1967), and there are similar organizations implied in the *Relacion de Michoac\u00e1n* (Acal\u00e1 2013). The ruling dynasty of each *ireta* was inherited patrilineally. The royal lineage claimed much of their authority from control over sacred religious idols of the city's patron deity (Beltr\u00e1n 1982). The actual position of Irecha was likely elected among the dynasty's heirs (Beltr\u00e1n 1982). As depicted in the *Relacion de Micoac\u00e1n* (Acal\u00e1 2013), the second most powerful ruler of the city was the *pet\u00e1muti* or high priest. The priesthood was also hereditary (Warren 1985) and had their own bureaucracy, although the relationship between the priesthood and neighborhood institutions is poorly understood. **The Early Tarascan Empire** Some time during the 14th century AD, the city of P\u00e1tzcuaro conquered the other cities in the Lake P\u00e1tzcuaro Basin and formed what might be best thought of as a tributary empire. The Uanacaze dynasty, from a tribe of Chichimecs known as the Uac\u00fasecha, deposed and eliminated many of the competing dynasties and placed members of their dynasty on the thrones of three key city-states. These cities established tributary hegemony over the lake basin and surrounding region. Tar\u00edacuri (the founder) had placed each of his three heirs Hiripan, Tangaxoan, and Hiquingaje in charge of Ihuatzio, Tzintzuntzan, and P\u00e1tzcuaro respectively (Acal\u00e1 2013). This early empire was likely a very fractious political arrangement. With some irony, it probably wasn't that different from the early Aztec Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan. Local political groups were likely granted a large degree of autonomy. Haskell (2013) actually argues that the Early Empire never really had control over the lake basin and instead relied on peripheral conquests to secure power in local politics. I'm not completely sold on that argument. but it's worth considering. The early empire likely resembled the tributary model seen elsewhere in Mesoamerica during the early part of its history more than it did at the time of Spanish contact. The ruler of the Tarascan Empire continued to use the title of *Irecha* (king) among P'ur\u00e9pecha language speakers. However, an additional title was added in diplomatic communications with the Aztecs: *Caltzontzin*, or (probably) \"Lord of Four Hundred Houses\" (Warren 1985). In 1454 (following Pollard's 1993 chronology), a mysterious conflict ensued upon the death emperor Hiqu\u00edngaje that may or may not have involved a civil war. A recently translated P'ur\u00e9pecha-language document published by Monz\u00f3n and colleagues (2009) indicates that the subsequent emperor, Tzitzispand\u00e1quare took the capital city of Tzintzuntzan by force. There are painfully few details on why this happened, but it's possible there was some kind of war of succession and/or rebellion after the last of the appointed successors of Tar\u00edacuri died. **The Late Tarascan Empire** After Tzitzisp\u00e1ndaquar\u00e9's accession to the throne the structure of the empire changed dramatically. A series of dramatic political reforms were enacted to reduce the ability of conquered peoples to rebel. Local nobility within some conquered provinces were replaced with leaders appointed by Tzintzuntzan from among more loyal ethnic groups (Acal\u00e1 2013), and all matters of succession among any vassals of the emperor were settled by the emperor. The actual provincial nobles were known now as the *caracha-capacha* (demoted from *irecha*). The emperor further usurped the ability of nobles to use marriage to make alliances. All daughters of nobles were sent to the emperor's palace in Tzintzuntzan when they came of age, and he would marry them off to other lords (Beltr\u00e1n 1982, Acal\u00e1 2013). Special tributary lands were set aside for the monarch in many conquered towns and cities, and farming or hunting on these lands without the King's permission was a serious offense. As was true for pre-imperial P'ur\u00e9pecha polities, the Tarascan Empire's second in command continued to be the Petamuti (or high priest). There was also a group of officials described in the *Relaci\u00f3n de Michoac\u00e1n* (Acal\u00e1 2013) as the \"Governors of the Four Quarters.\" Ostensibly, the empire was divided into four parts based on the cardinal directions centered on the capital Tzintzuntzan. Yet in practice, we have virtually know idea what these governors did on a day-to-day basis (Beltr\u00e1n 1982). Their role may have been critical or purely ceremonial. There was also a group of nobles known as the *Achaecha* (a general term for noble) that followed the monarch around at all times (Acal\u00e1 2013). These were likely members of various advisory councils, although they may have been provincial lords. A separate tributary bureaucracy, the *oc\u00e1mbecha*, now managed the collection of taxes directly from the population instead of taking tribute from the city's government. According to the *Relaci\u00f3n de Michoac\u00e1n* (Acal\u00e1 2013), these officials were at some point assigned to units of 25 households, which would mean they also bypassed the authority of the neighborhood *uap\u00e1tzequa* organization. In addition to collecting taxes, they also took census. The emperor also appears to have \"nationalized\" the trade guilds. The *Relaci\u00f3n de Michoac\u00e1n* describes how the head of various crafting guilds were typically hereditary but that the monarch officially appointed them, much like the provincial nobility (Acal\u00e1 2013, Beltr\u00e1n 1982). **Conclusion** By the time of the arrival of the Spanish the Tarascan Empire was a highly centralized, bureaucratized state, but this was largely a result of reforms later in the empire's history. For much of the history of the empire, this was not the case. The empire instead began as a loose hegemonic collection of city-states with multi-level subdivisions within city-states. The Tarascan Empire managed to build it's centralized bureaucracy by co-opting existing political arrangements and creating a dependency between local institutions and the monarchy. **Sources:** * Acal\u00e1, Ger\u00f3nimo de. 2013 [1540]. *Relaci\u00f3n de las ceremonias y ritos y poblacion y gobierno de los indios de la provincia de Michoac\u00e1n.* * Beltr\u00e1n, Ulises. 1982. *Tarascan State and Soceity in Prehispanic Times: An Ethnohistorical Inquiry.* PhD Dissertation, University of Chicago. * Gilberti, Fray Maturino. 1983 [1559] *Vocabulario en la lengua Mechuacan Compuesto por el reverendo padre Fray Maturino Gilberti de la ord\u00e9 del Ser\u00e1fico Padre San Francisco.* Balsal Editores.

The royal lineage claimed much of their authority from control over sacred religious idols of the city's patron deity (Beltr\u00e1n 1982). The actual position of Irecha was likely elected among the dynasty's heirs (Beltr\u00e1n 1982). As depicted in the *Relacion de Micoac\u00e1n* (Acal\u00e1 2013), the second most powerful ruler of the city was the *pet\u00e1muti* or high priest. The priesthood was also hereditary (Warren 1985) and had their own bureaucracy, although the relationship between the priesthood and neighborhood institutions is poorly understood. **The Early Tarascan Empire** Some time during the 14th century AD, the city of P\u00e1tzcuaro conquered the other cities in the Lake P\u00e1tzcuaro Basin and formed what might be best thought of as a tributary empire. The Uanacaze dynasty, from a tribe of Chichimecs known as the Uac\u00fasecha, deposed and eliminated many of the competing dynasties and placed members of their dynasty on the thrones of three key city-states. These cities established tributary hegemony over the lake basin and surrounding region. Tar\u00edacuri (the founder) had placed each of his three heirs Hiripan, Tangaxoan, and Hiquingaje in charge of Ihuatzio, Tzintzuntzan, and P\u00e1tzcuaro respectively (Acal\u00e1 2013). This early empire was likely a very fractious political arrangement. With some irony, it probably wasn't that different from the early Aztec Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan. Local political groups were likely granted a large degree of autonomy. Haskell (2013) actually argues that the Early Empire never really had control over the lake basin and instead relied on peripheral conquests to secure power in local politics. I'm not completely sold on that argument. but it's worth considering. The early empire likely resembled the tributary model seen elsewhere in Mesoamerica during the early part of its history more than it did at the time of Spanish contact. The ruler of the Tarascan Empire continued to use the title of *Irecha* (king) among P'ur\u00e9pecha language speakers. However, an additional title was added in diplomatic communications with the Aztecs: *Caltzontzin*, or (probably) \"Lord of Four Hundred Houses\" (Warren 1985). In 1454 (following Pollard's 1993 chronology), a mysterious conflict ensued upon the death emperor Hiqu\u00edngaje that may or may not have involved a civil war. A recently translated P'ur\u00e9pecha-language document published by Monz\u00f3n and colleagues (2009) indicates that the subsequent emperor, Tzitzispand\u00e1quare took the capital city of Tzintzuntzan by force. There are painfully few details on why this happened, but it's possible there was some kind of war of succession and/or rebellion after the last of the appointed successors of Tar\u00edacuri died. **The Late Tarascan Empire** After Tzitzisp\u00e1ndaquar\u00e9's accession to the throne the structure of the empire changed dramatically. A series of dramatic political reforms were enacted to reduce the ability of conquered peoples to rebel. Local nobility within some conquered provinces were replaced with leaders appointed by Tzintzuntzan from among more loyal ethnic groups (Acal\u00e1 2013), and all matters of succession among any vassals of the emperor were settled by the emperor. The actual provincial nobles were known now as the *caracha-capacha* (demoted from *irecha*). The emperor further usurped the ability of nobles to use marriage to make alliances. All daughters of nobles were sent to the emperor's palace in Tzintzuntzan when they came of age, and he would marry them off to other lords (Beltr\u00e1n 1982, Acal\u00e1 2013). Special tributary lands were set aside for the monarch in many conquered towns and cities, and farming or hunting on these lands without the King's permission was a serious offense. As was true for pre-imperial P'ur\u00e9pecha polities, the Tarascan Empire's second in command continued to be the Petamuti (or high priest). There was also a group of officials described in the *Relaci\u00f3n de Michoac\u00e1n* (Acal\u00e1 2013) as the \"Governors of the Four Quarters.\" Ostensibly, the empire was divided into four parts based on the cardinal directions centered on the capital Tzintzuntzan. Yet in practice, we have virtually know idea what these governors did on a day-to-day basis (Beltr\u00e1n 1982). Their role may have been critical or purely ceremonial. There was also a group of nobles known as the *Achaecha* (a general term for noble) that followed the monarch around at all times (Acal\u00e1 2013). These were likely members of various advisory councils, although they may have been provincial lords. A separate tributary bureaucracy, the *oc\u00e1mbecha*, now managed the collection of taxes directly from the population instead of taking tribute from the city's government. According to the *Relaci\u00f3n de Michoac\u00e1n* (Acal\u00e1 2013), these officials were at some point assigned to units of 25 households, which would mean they also bypassed the authority of the neighborhood *uap\u00e1tzequa* organization. In addition to collecting taxes, they also took census. The emperor also appears to have \"nationalized\" the trade guilds. The *Relaci\u00f3n de Michoac\u00e1n* describes how the head of various crafting guilds were typically hereditary but that the monarch officially appointed them, much like the provincial nobility (Acal\u00e1 2013, Beltr\u00e1n 1982). **Conclusion** By the time of the arrival of the Spanish the Tarascan Empire was a highly centralized, bureaucratized state, but this was largely a result of reforms later in the empire's history. For much of the history of the empire, this was not the case. The empire instead began as a loose hegemonic collection of city-states with multi-level subdivisions within city-states. The Tarascan Empire managed to build it's centralized bureaucracy by co-opting existing political arrangements and creating a dependency between local institutions and the monarchy. **Sources:** * Acal\u00e1, Ger\u00f3nimo de. 2013 [1540]. *Relaci\u00f3n de las ceremonias y ritos y poblacion y gobierno de los indios de la provincia de Michoac\u00e1n.* * Beltr\u00e1n, Ulises. 1982. *Tarascan State and Soceity in Prehispanic Times: An Ethnohistorical Inquiry.* PhD Dissertation, University of Chicago. * Gilberti, Fray Maturino. 1983 [1559] *Vocabulario en la lengua Mechuacan Compuesto por el reverendo padre Fray Maturino Gilberti de la ord\u00e9 del Ser\u00e1fico Padre San Francisco.* Balsal Editores.

{"original_text": "I used to study bubble dynamics from the context of ultrasound contrast agents, but the science is similar. One way to look at it is as an ideal gas with varying volume. As the volume decreases, temperature increases. With a strong enough collapse the bubble can reach a tiny fraction of its initial size, and thus many times its initial temperature. This, however, I don't think is enough to explain the observed temperatures. Bubble dynamics are often modeled by treating them as a harmonic oscillator (with some nonlinearities as well). The mass is proportional to the amount of water displaced by the bubble, and the spring constant is related to the pressure inside the bubble. When you apply an external pressure (from an ultrasound transducer), this acts as a driver of the harmonic oscillator. The radius oscillates with megahertz frequencies (for micron size bubbles), and if the oscillations are strong enough than the rate of change (velocity) can approach or exceed the speed of sound. The acceleration is quite intense (~100,000 g) and I think this, as well as the temperatures involved, is what contributes to the ionization. As a mechanical engineer/thermal fluids guy I imagine you know the importance of understanding cavitation. Specifically with sonoluminescence, there's interest in using it to induce/mediate chemical reactions. There was also a guy who claimed he produced nuclear fusion with it, but that's highly doubted.

{"original_text": "While it depends on the type, surgeries do tend to bleed a lot. Superficially there may not seem to be much bleeding, however a large amount of blood may have been suctioned away or hidden, collecting at the bottom of a cavity (e.g. abdominal surgery). However, unless there is truly significant blood loss, there is a tendency towards replacing fluid rather than using blood transfusions. There are several methods used to reduce blood loss. Most of the surgeries I've seen used a diathermy (rather than a scalpel) - It's a device that uses an electrical current to cut and cauterise tissue, closing the smaller blood vessels/capillaries and preventing excessive bleeding. Laser surgery presumably achieves a similar thing. For larger blood vessels, the surgeons can throw a few stitches (a ligature) to tie off the blood vessel, or close the vessel with a clip. Prior to tying/clipping the vessel, haemostats might be used to clamp close the vessel. For orthopaedic/limb surgery, a tourniquet can be used to completely occlude blood supply to that limb (which presents risks of ischaemia/damage). Positioning the patient in a certain way can also reduce bleeding (e.g. a downwards slope with the head and chest lower than the abdomen and legs). In terms of pharmaceuticals, the anaesthetist can use drugs to maintain a lower blood pressure to reduce bleeding. In scenarios with a high risk of blood loss, drugs can be used reduce bleeding (i.e. antifibrinolytics and coagulants).

{"original_text": "I can't answer all of this, but if you're interested in Hawaiian settlement I would highly recommend that you visit the Kahanu Garden on Maui. I've been to one of its sister gardens on Kauai, and they did a great job highlighting the native and canoe plants of the islands. What are canoe plants, you ask? Well, this is where I answer part of your question; namely, what they took with them. To a certain extent, Hawaii was similar to the other islands settled by Polynesian voyagers. However, they didn't just \"live off the land,\" as some romanticized depictions imply. They couldn't, because most of the islands they encountered didn't natively have a ready supply of edible and useful plants and animals. Instead, they brought plants and animals with them. One of the most important canoe plants was taro, a root vegetable. It is cooked, then pounded into a paste to create *poi,* a staple of the Hawaiian diet. Water is often added to vary consistencies, and poi is also sometimes left to ferment a little, which gives it a vaguely yoghurt-like flavor. Coconut trees were another very useful canoe plant. In addition to the obvious food usage, they could be used for lumber, and their fronds used for thatch. In fact, there's actually very little you *can't* make out of some part of the coconut tree, making it an important plant to have if you were venturing off to an uninhabited island. Versatility was key in a canoe plant. Boat space was tight, and the plants and seeds were tenderly looked after. Unlike animals, which could be slaughtered if times were rough, saplings and cuttings didn't provide a great source of emergency food. So, many of the canoe plants were, like coconuts, used for multiple purposes. The leaves of the banana plant were used for roofs. The mastwood tree was great for building ships, but also produced an oil that could be used as medicine. Gourds were grown to be used for containers for just about everything, as well as drums and rattles for making music. Anyone who has been to Hawaii knows that pork and pig products are a staple of their cuisine. Not only did the Polynesian settlers bring various plants with them, they brought pigs, chickens (junglefowl), and a type of dog that was once common to Polynesia. As you might imagine, they ate the pigs and chickens, as well as the chicken eggs. As you might not imagine, they also ate the dogs. The so-called \"Hawaiian dog\" more or less roamed free in the villages and taro fields, and were primarily fed poi. They do not seem to have been suitable for hunting or any of the usual things dogs are bred for. Instead, they were primarily a food source, and also were seen as a sort of \"good-luck\" charm. The Hawaiian dog was one variant of the Polynesian dog that was once common across the Marquesas, New Zealand, and other Polynesian areas. They have all died off since, so we are unfortunately left primarily with depictions and bones. Cook described them as \"having short crooked legs, long backs, and prickly ears.\u201d While feral pigs were (and very much still are) around in Hawaii, Polynesians seem to have generally tried to keep their pigs contained and close. We know this in part because free-roaming pigs would have been a major nuisance to the sweet potato and taro plants that were integral to the Polynesians' lifestyle. We also know this because Hawaii at the time did not have the resources necessary to sustain large populations of feral pigs. Even if they were a bit more free-ranging, the pigs would have had to keep close to humans if they wanted reliable food. So, the early Polynesian settlers of Hawaii were quite prepared, and had a fairly sophisticated agricultural system that helped ensure their survival in their new home. I have used the past tense in this article, because you were asking about the first settlers, but it's important to recognize that Hawaiian and Polynesian culture is not a thing of the past. That culture is still very much alive today, and you will undoubtedly meet plenty of proud Hawaiians who may still know and use these same plants in the ways their ancestors did. You will certainly eat plenty of coconut and pig products! I'd recommend trying poi as well, not because I'm particularly fond of it (I'm not), but because it has been so important to Hawaiian culture.

The so-called \"Hawaiian dog\" more or less roamed free in the villages and taro fields, and were primarily fed poi. They do not seem to have been suitable for hunting or any of the usual things dogs are bred for. Instead, they were primarily a food source, and also were seen as a sort of \"good-luck\" charm. The Hawaiian dog was one variant of the Polynesian dog that was once common across the Marquesas, New Zealand, and other Polynesian areas. They have all died off since, so we are unfortunately left primarily with depictions and bones. Cook described them as \"having short crooked legs, long backs, and prickly ears.\u201d While feral pigs were (and very much still are) around in Hawaii, Polynesians seem to have generally tried to keep their pigs contained and close. We know this in part because free-roaming pigs would have been a major nuisance to the sweet potato and taro plants that were integral to the Polynesians' lifestyle. We also know this because Hawaii at the time did not have the resources necessary to sustain large populations of feral pigs. Even if they were a bit more free-ranging, the pigs would have had to keep close to humans if they wanted reliable food. So, the early Polynesian settlers of Hawaii were quite prepared, and had a fairly sophisticated agricultural system that helped ensure their survival in their new home. I have used the past tense in this article, because you were asking about the first settlers, but it's important to recognize that Hawaiian and Polynesian culture is not a thing of the past. That culture is still very much alive today, and you will undoubtedly meet plenty of proud Hawaiians who may still know and use these same plants in the ways their ancestors did. You will certainly eat plenty of coconut and pig products! I'd recommend trying poi as well, not because I'm particularly fond of it (I'm not), but because it has been so important to Hawaiian culture. You'll find it in a variety of consistencies and tastes, some quite sour, so even if you don't like one version, you may like another."}

Affected infants are usually born with serious and progressive kidney disease due to congenital nephrotic syndrome, although some do not have kidney failure until adulthood. Most require a renal transplant for endstage kidney disease within the first decade of life. Ocular (eye) abnormalities are another common feature of Pierson syndrome. Most affected infants are born with abnormally small pupils (microcoria). Other ocular abnormalities may include cataracts, glaucoma, retinal detachments, and blindness. Those that survive past infancy typically have neurological disabilities and developmental delays. Many children with Pierson syndrome don't achieve normal milestones such as sitting, standing, and talking. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Pierson syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom.

Water is very nearly incompressible, but a large enough outside force can actually reduce the volume of a certain mass of water (ie make it more dense) so it occupies less space. Compression & pressurization are two different things, although they are not entirely independent of one another."}

{"original_text": "Enlarged and Misshapen Bones Paget's disease of bone causes affected bones to become enlarged and misshapen. Our bones are living tissue, and our bodies are constantly breaking down old bone and replacing it with new bone. In Paget's disease, however, old bone is broken down and replaced at a faster rate than normal. The new bone is larger and weaker than normal bone. Paget's disease can occur in any bone in the body, but it is most common in the pelvis, spine, skull, and leg bones. It may occur in just one bone or in several bones, but it does not affect the entire skeleton or spread from affected bones to normal bones. Common symptoms include pain, misshapen bones, and a greater chance of broken bones. Complications Paget's disease can also lead to complications, such as arthritis, headaches, hearing loss, or nervous system problems, depending on which bones are affected. If not treated, Paget's disease can reduce a person's ability to perform activities of daily living, thereby reducing quality of life. Although it is the second most common bone disease after osteoporosis, Paget's disease is still uncommon. According to Bone Health and Osteoporosis: A Report of the Surgeon General, an estimated 1 million people in the U.S. have Paget's disease, or about 1.3 people per 100 men and women age 4574. The disease is more common in older people and those of Northern European heritage. Men are more likely than women to have the disease. Cause is Unknown Paget's disease is named after the British surgeon, Sir James Paget, who first identified the disease in 1877. Researchers are not sure what causes it. Heredity may be a factor in some cases. Research suggests that a close relative of someone with Paget's disease is seven times more likely to develop the disease than someone without an affected relative. However, most people with Paget's disease do not have any relatives with the disease. Researchers think the disease also may be caused by other factors, such as a slowacting virus. A Treatable Disease The good news is that Paget's disease of bone is treatable, especially if it is diagnosed early. In recent years, the Food and Drug Administration has approved several medications that can stop or slow the disease's progression. In some cases, surgery can help patients manage the symptoms and complications of the disease.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Enlarged and Misshapen Bones Paget's disease of bone causes affected bones to become enlarged and misshapen. Our bones are living tissue, and our bodies are constantly breaking down old bone and replacing it with new bone. In Paget's disease, however, old bone is broken down and replaced at a faster rate than normal. The new bone is larger and weaker than normal bone. Paget's disease can occur in any bone in the body, but it is most common in the pelvis, spine, skull, and leg bones. It may occur in just one bone or in several bones, but it does not affect the entire skeleton or spread from affected bones to normal bones. Common symptoms include pain, misshapen bones, and a greater chance of broken bones.

{"original_text": "A number of changes occur in a person as they exercise, and we don't understand all of them (and I'm going to only talk about a few of the ones we do understand). These changes also differ between types of exercise. Since you mention running for an hour, I'm going to talk about aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise depends, among other things, upon your heart and lungs's ability to efficiently oxygenate blood and pump it to your muscles, your muscles' ability to take up oxygen and fuel (and store fuel in advance of exercise), and your muscles' ability to use fuel. Over time, aerobic exercise changes your heart. Your left ventricle in particular (this is the last chamber of your heart, which forces blood out to the body) may enlarge to hold more blood and strengthen to pump it better. You may notice that nowadays your resting heart rate it lower than it used to be; this is because your heart can now pump the same amount of blood with fewer beats. You may also increase the number of red blood cells you have for carrying oxygen (though often blood volume also increases to the point that your count/volume will stay the same or even drop). Your skeletal muscle also changes when you exercise a lot, and how it changes can depend on the kind of exercise you do. Very broadly speaking, there are two ways your muscles can burn fuel for energy. They can incompletely burn glucose very fast, without oxygen, for a quick burst of energy, or they can burn a variety of fuels, including sugar and fat, all the way to carbon dioxide and water using oxygen for a lot of energy over time. Aerobic exercise selectively increases your cellular equipment for the latter. This kind of metabolism happens in your mitochondria, and your muscles will make more of them and they will get bigger. They will also make more of the enzymes required to burn fuel in this manner. This makes them better at doing aerobic exercise, because the same muscle cell can now burn more fuel per second. However, they may actually make less of some of the enzymes used for the quick, no oxygen kind of metabolism. Aerobic exercise can also increase your muscles' ability to take fuel, especially fat, out of the blood to use for fuel.

In most cases, dietary restrictions and medications can significantly improve the problematic symptoms of this condition. Food allergy testing is used as a guide for restriction or elimination diets. An elimination diet means strictly avoiding all foods to which the patient has tested positive on allergy testing. Skin and patch testing are used to guide elimination diets. Sometimes a stricter diet, called an elemental diet, is needed. Skin and patch testing are used to guide elimination diets, but it only takes one false negative food for the diet to \"fail\".

Amino acids do not cause allergic reactions but whole or partial proteins can. Children and adults who rely in part, or completely, on an elemental amino acid based formula may have a difficult time drinking enough of the formula.

{"original_text": "This is a complex case where later narrative has muddled the issues considerably. The stereotype also depends on whom you ask: we in Finland haven't even really agreed yet on what the conflict should be called, since for those in the more nationalistic/right-wing/white (these are not exactly same things) end of the spectrum have preferred \"War of Independence\" or \"Freedom War,\" while those in the left end have used terms like \"revolution\" or \"rebellion,\" and others have used \"Red rebellion\" and the like. The Civil War is the neutral-ish term though, and the one I believe fits the best; although it isn't a contemporary term. But none of the other terms is completely wrong either: there *were* some elements of a struggle for independence, for example. As is usual with civil wars, the background is more nuanced than simplified narratives suggest. On the face of it, the conflict pitted the working class against landowners and the middle class; but the conflict also divided Finns along territorial lines. Many people in the northern and coastal parts of the country would have qualified as working class, but they actively supported the White side; and there were people from privileged backgrounds in the southern parts supporting the Red side (although these were fairly rare). Consequently, there is no simple answer to your question. If I stereotype somewhat, the prototypical or let's say \"modal\" White (right-wing isn't the term I'd use here) would be a rural farmer or farmer's son from the Western or North-Western part of Finland; the stereotypical \"butcher\" in the Red literature comes from Ostrobothnia. He would typically hail from a small homestead, and many possess an independent streak and pride of being a \"free man\" who boasts that he takes off his hat only in church for the God and no one else. Particularly in the Ostrobothnian region, a conservative pietist sect called Laestadianism (and other conservative Lutheran interpretations) would hold considerable influence, so most were at least on paper pious Christians; the level and steadfastness of actual religious practice may have differed greatly though. The one thing these men *did* certainly believe in was hard work: the line in the Bible, \"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread\" definitely rang a bell to people who scraped their living from the soil near the Arctic Circle. The massive famine of 1867-8 was still within the living memory, and everyone knew how to supplant their grain stocks with dried *pettu*, the somewhat-edible part between pine tree's bark and trunk. Sayings such as \"industrious man sweats when working, lazy when eating\" and \"work is man's honor\" were common, and to a large extent both men and women were valued on how hard-working they were. Communality was also important, and people identified themselves according to villages they lived in. But in the end, every household was supposed to look after itself; the other households would help if needed, but becoming reliant on others for help would have been a great shame indeed. But then: the very same description, with the possible exception of ultra-conservative Christianity (that did not root as much into southern part of the country), could easily describe the stereotypical Red as well. It was more an accident of birth or consequence that determined the side a \"prototypical\" Red or White might have taken in the Civil War, not any major difference in values or attitudes as such. The Reds were also, for the most part, true believers in hard work and at least (and by modern standards especially) good churchgoers, if not exactly good Christians always. Some of the more educated did question the religion for example, and such \"liberalism\" was more prevalent within the urban working class; but Finland was very much an agrarian country and that was still a minority compared to rural or semi-rural Reds. Here, economic circumstances mattered more: if you were a tenant farmer or a farmhand without any land to call your own, the Socialist cause that spoke of land reform was certainly appealing. It is a good question what was the extent of a typical Red's ideological education: I'd say it was probably fairly superficial, despite the efforts of so-called \"agitators.\" However, there were also those who had been in the Socialist movement for quite long and could be very knowledgeable indeed, so this is again a stereotype. Similarly, those on the White side were quite probably often fairly unaware of the larger implications: when they read from their newspapers and heard from the Church sermons that there is a rebellion against \"lawful\" government - by \"atheists\" allied with the Russians, and seeking to take away all private property no less - it probably didn't take much more to label the Reds as beasts in human form, despite the fact that a nominally land-owning smallholder from Kainuu or Savo might have had much greater common interests with tenant farmers and working class in the south. Note, though that newspapers on both sides of the ideological divide did their very best in painting the other guys as monsters: balanced reporting didn't exist then. Those on the Red side, for example, implicated the upper classes as being behind the bread shortages of 1917 so that they could profit from them. The bitterness resulting from the wartime rationing and rationing policies was probably a major factor dividing the people to Reds and Whites; e.g. to \"producers\" in the countryside vs. \"consumers\" in the cities. However, it needs to be noted that the abovementioned attitudes were far from uniform, and partially as a consequence the White army was not all-volunteer; the government introduced conscription, and the majority were in fact conscripts (estimated ca. 75 000 out of maximum strength of 90 000). The Red soldiers, on the other hand, were almost all volunteers. In fact, the White leadership believed that the motivation of smallholder soldiers from Central and Northern Finland to fight against men of very similar background and beliefs would be fairly low; and in propaganda, the fight was depicted as one against \"Red Russkies\" and their lap-dogs. Nevertheless, one estimate has it that 30 000 men did not report for call-ups in the White-controlled areas, and the most prominent probable reason was Red sympathies. In summary: it's complicated, at least if we're talking about the rank and file on both sides. It's easier with the upper classes, who tended to fairly uniformly favor the Whites and hoped that Finland would gain independence while retaining the pre-World War status quo where (in their imagination) wise, educated upper class would exert fatherly rule over noble, industrious, patriotic and grateful peasants. Well, it didn't work out exactly that way; and I suspect that in the backslash, the Reds got a lot of bad press.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This is a complex case where later narrative has muddled the issues considerably.

But in the end, every household was supposed to look after itself; the other households would help if needed, but becoming reliant on others for help would have been a great shame indeed. But then: the very same description, with the possible exception of ultra-conservative Christianity (that did not root as much into southern part of the country), could easily describe the stereotypical Red as well. It was more an accident of birth or consequence that determined the side a \"prototypical\" Red or White might have taken in the Civil War, not any major difference in values or attitudes as such. The Reds were also, for the most part, true believers in hard work and at least (and by modern standards especially) good churchgoers, if not exactly good Christians always. Some of the more educated did question the religion for example, and such \"liberalism\" was more prevalent within the urban working class; but Finland was very much an agrarian country and that was still a minority compared to rural or semi-rural Reds. Here, economic circumstances mattered more: if you were a tenant farmer or a farmhand without any land to call your own, the Socialist cause that spoke of land reform was certainly appealing. It is a good question what was the extent of a typical Red's ideological education: I'd say it was probably fairly superficial, despite the efforts of so-called \"agitators.\" However, there were also those who had been in the Socialist movement for quite long and could be very knowledgeable indeed, so this is again a stereotype. Similarly, those on the White side were quite probably often fairly unaware of the larger implications: when they read from their newspapers and heard from the Church sermons that there is a rebellion against \"lawful\" government - by \"atheists\" allied with the Russians, and seeking to take away all private property no less - it probably didn't take much more to label the Reds as beasts in human form, despite the fact that a nominally land-owning smallholder from Kainuu or Savo might have had much greater common interests with tenant farmers and working class in the south. Note, though that newspapers on both sides of the ideological divide did their very best in painting the other guys as monsters: balanced reporting didn't exist then. Those on the Red side, for example, implicated the upper classes as being behind the bread shortages of 1917 so that they could profit from them. The bitterness resulting from the wartime rationing and rationing policies was probably a major factor dividing the people to Reds and Whites; e.g. to \"producers\" in the countryside vs. \"consumers\" in the cities. However, it needs to be noted that the abovementioned attitudes were far from uniform, and partially as a consequence the White army was not all-volunteer; the government introduced conscription, and the majority were in fact conscripts (estimated ca. 75 000 out of maximum strength of 90 000). The Red soldiers, on the other hand, were almost all volunteers. In fact, the White leadership believed that the motivation of smallholder soldiers from Central and Northern Finland to fight against men of very similar background and beliefs would be fairly low; and in propaganda, the fight was depicted as one against \"Red Russkies\" and their lap-dogs. Nevertheless, one estimate has it that 30 000 men did not report for call-ups in the White-controlled areas, and the most prominent probable reason was Red sympathies. In summary: it's complicated, at least if we're talking about the rank and file on both sides. It's easier with the upper classes, who tended to fairly uniformly favor the Whites and hoped that Finland would gain independence while retaining the pre-World War status quo where (in their imagination) wise, educated upper class would exert fatherly rule over noble, industrious, patriotic and grateful peasants. Well, it didn't work out exactly that way; and I suspect that in the backslash, the Reds got a lot of bad press."}

{"original_text": "After uterine sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body. Uterine sarcoma may be diagnosed, staged, and treated in the same surgery. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. The following stages are used for uterine sarcoma: Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV After uterine sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body. The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following procedures may be used in the staging process: Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. CA 125 assay: A test that measures the level of CA 125 in the blood. CA 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream. An increased CA 125 level is sometimes a sign of cancer or other condition. Chest xray: An xray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. Transvaginal ultrasound exam: A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and bladder. An ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The doctor can identify tumors by looking at the sonogram. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen and pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues to show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Cystoscopy: A procedure to look inside the bladder and urethra to check for abnormal areas. A cystoscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder. A cystoscope is a thin, tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. Uterine sarcoma may be diagnosed, staged, and treated in the same surgery. Surgery is used to diagnose, stage, and treat uterine sarcoma. During this surgery, the doctor removes as much of the cancer as possible. The following procedures may be used to diagnose, stage, and treat uterine sarcoma: Laparotomy: A surgical procedure in which an incision (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. Sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease. Abdominal and pelvic washings: A procedure in which a saline solution is placed into the abdominal and pelvic body cavities. After a short time, the fluid is removed and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells. Total abdominal hysterectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the uterus and cervix through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen. Bilateral salpingooophorectomy: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy: A surgical procedure in which lymph nodes are removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. For a regional lymphadenectomy, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. For a radical lymphadenectomy, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. This procedure is also called lymph node dissection. Treatment in addition to surgery may be given, as described in the Treatment Option Overview section of this summary. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if uterine sarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually uterine sarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic uterine sarcoma, not lung cancer. The following stages are used for uterine sarcoma: Stage I In stage I, cancer is found in the uterus only. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB, based on how far the cancer has spread. Stage IA: Cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (muscle layer of the uterus). Stage IB: Cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium. Stage II In stage II, cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus. Stage III In stage III, cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix, but has not spread beyond the pelvis. Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis. Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and ligaments of the uterus. Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the vagina or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the uterus). Stage IIIC: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (largest artery in the body, which carries blood away from the heart). Stage IV In stage IV, cancer has spread beyond the pelvis. Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB, based on how far the cancer has spread.

{"original_text": "General Georges Boulanger was a French military officer and politician whose peaceful bid for power in the late 1880s was the French Third Republic's \"most serious peacetime challenge,\" in the words of historian Robert Tombs. A monumentally interesting and overlooked figure, Boulanger was defeated in part through his own personal failings, in part by his failure to build a political movement that transcended his own person, and in part by the belated wagon-circling of establishment republicans who were (and this is key) unafraid to play dirty to beat him. The moment of crisis came at a time when France was disunited, with a political spectrum running from far-left revolutionaries to far-right monarchists, barely held together by an unstable centrist coalition of left- and right-wing republicans. The 1880s added to this volatile mix political corruption, which discredited establishment powers and forced the resignation of the country's president. All the major political figures were too controversial to win a majority in parliament (which chose the president). To escape this gridlock, French deputies compromised by instead choosing a mediocrity: Sadi Carnot, the undistinguished grandson of famed Revolutionary genius Lazare Carnot. \u201cHe\u2019s not very bright, but he has a republican name,\u201d quipped Georges Clemenceau. Of humbler stock and bolder character was Boulanger, the son of a provincial lawyer who idolized Napoleon I and joined the army as soon as he could. There he distinguished himself for his courage, good fortune and excellent horsemanship, and later through bold action in the field in Algeria, Italy, and Paris itself (against both Germans and communards). He also demonstrated a knack for self-promotion and ideological flexibility: a secret police report said he had a reputation in the barracks as an \"ardent clerical\" even as he was forging politically advantageous ties to left-wing politicians like Clemenceau and L\u00e9on Gambetta, which earned him promotions: to general in 1880, and then to the army's Inspector of Infantry two years later. There Boulanger proved himself both a bold reformer and an outspoken nationalist. These were popular positions and Boulanger continued to milk this popularity and his political connections to rise, being appointed to command France's army in Tunisia in 1884 and then minister of war in 1886. One of his defeated rivals described Boulanger's character thusly: > [Boulanger's] chief attribute is his savoir-faire. He needed it to reach the position he holds at his age, but he lacks a cultivated mind. He has no conversation, either. You feel that here is a man who has read little, thought little about higher things and who has no wide-ranging ideas. His whole mind is bent towards advancement and personal politics. Never under any circumstances have I heard him express an idea or an opinion about what should be done out here. He is quite indifferent to it all. While probably apt, none of this posed the slightest obstacle to Boulanger's continued rise. For one thing, his peacetime military reforms were genuinely important: against fierce opposition, he eliminated widespread exemptions from nominally compulsory military service while also shortening the term of service from five years to three and making army life \"considerably less squalid\" with such improvements as mattresses instead of straw pallets and better food and uniforms. More substantively, he helped introduce a new rifle; more symbolically, he let soldiers grow beards (a liberty he promptly took advantage of). For another thing, the dominant political mood was *revanche*, a roiling popular resentment against Germany for the humiliation and annexations of the 1871 Franco-Prussian War. Boulanger, dashing on horseback, put himself at the head of this chauvinistic revival, and duly benefitted when Otto von Bismarck publicly warned that Boulanger was likely to provoke another war with Germany. Establishment politicians were far more cautious, and Boulanger soon became sweepingly popular, with more than 370 songs written about him in three years and newfangled photographs framed over mantles across the country. He was dubbed *G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Revanche*, or General Revenge. This rising popularity caused some of his erstwhile patrons to reconsider. \"There's something about you that appeals to the crowd,\" Clemenceau warned Boulanger. \"That's the temptation. That's the danger I want you to guard against.\" But Boulanger was made for the spotlight, and did not pull back. A charismatic chimera, the politically disaffected from all sides gazed on Boulanger and saw in General Revenge their ticket to power. Thus began to form \"*Boulangisme*,\" an inchoate political movement built around Boulanger and a sort of reflexive anti-establishmentarianism. In Tombs' words, it was \"a new and heady combination of Left and Right: a tawdry mixture of the intrigue of ambitious radicals, the revolutionary nostalgia of aging Blanquists, the desperate cynicism of failed royalists, and the weekend jingoism of Parisian office-boys.\" The fact that the communists and monarchists who rallied to Boulanger agreed on little else mattered little \u2014 they had the same enemy, moderate parliamentarism.

A monumentally interesting and overlooked figure, Boulanger was defeated in part through his own personal failings, in part by his failure to build a political movement that transcended his own person, and in part by the belated wagon-circling of establishment republicans who were (and this is key) unafraid to play dirty to beat him. The moment of crisis came at a time when France was disunited, with a political spectrum running from far-left revolutionaries to far-right monarchists, barely held together by an unstable centrist coalition of left- and right-wing republicans. The 1880s added to this volatile mix political corruption, which discredited establishment powers and forced the resignation of the country's president. All the major political figures were too controversial to win a majority in parliament (which chose the president). To escape this gridlock, French deputies compromised by instead choosing a mediocrity: Sadi Carnot, the undistinguished grandson of famed Revolutionary genius Lazare Carnot. \u201cHe\u2019s not very bright, but he has a republican name,\u201d quipped Georges Clemenceau. Of humbler stock and bolder character was Boulanger, the son of a provincial lawyer who idolized Napoleon I and joined the army as soon as he could. There he distinguished himself for his courage, good fortune and excellent horsemanship, and later through bold action in the field in Algeria, Italy, and Paris itself (against both Germans and communards). He also demonstrated a knack for self-promotion and ideological flexibility: a secret police report said he had a reputation in the barracks as an \"ardent clerical\" even as he was forging politically advantageous ties to left-wing politicians like Clemenceau and L\u00e9on Gambetta, which earned him promotions: to general in 1880, and then to the army's Inspector of Infantry two years later. There Boulanger proved himself both a bold reformer and an outspoken nationalist. These were popular positions and Boulanger continued to milk this popularity and his political connections to rise, being appointed to command France's army in Tunisia in 1884 and then minister of war in 1886. One of his defeated rivals described Boulanger's character thusly: > [Boulanger's] chief attribute is his savoir-faire. He needed it to reach the position he holds at his age, but he lacks a cultivated mind. He has no conversation, either. You feel that here is a man who has read little, thought little about higher things and who has no wide-ranging ideas. His whole mind is bent towards advancement and personal politics. Never under any circumstances have I heard him express an idea or an opinion about what should be done out here. He is quite indifferent to it all. While probably apt, none of this posed the slightest obstacle to Boulanger's continued rise. For one thing, his peacetime military reforms were genuinely important: against fierce opposition, he eliminated widespread exemptions from nominally compulsory military service while also shortening the term of service from five years to three and making army life \"considerably less squalid\" with such improvements as mattresses instead of straw pallets and better food and uniforms. More substantively, he helped introduce a new rifle; more symbolically, he let soldiers grow beards (a liberty he promptly took advantage of). For another thing, the dominant political mood was *revanche*, a roiling popular resentment against Germany for the humiliation and annexations of the 1871 Franco-Prussian War. Boulanger, dashing on horseback, put himself at the head of this chauvinistic revival, and duly benefitted when Otto von Bismarck publicly warned that Boulanger was likely to provoke another war with Germany. Establishment politicians were far more cautious, and Boulanger soon became sweepingly popular, with more than 370 songs written about him in three years and newfangled photographs framed over mantles across the country. He was dubbed *G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Revanche*, or General Revenge. This rising popularity caused some of his erstwhile patrons to reconsider. \"There's something about you that appeals to the crowd,\" Clemenceau warned Boulanger. \"That's the temptation. That's the danger I want you to guard against.\" But Boulanger was made for the spotlight, and did not pull back. A charismatic chimera, the politically disaffected from all sides gazed on Boulanger and saw in General Revenge their ticket to power. Thus began to form \"*Boulangisme*,\" an inchoate political movement built around Boulanger and a sort of reflexive anti-establishmentarianism. In Tombs' words, it was \"a new and heady combination of Left and Right: a tawdry mixture of the intrigue of ambitious radicals, the revolutionary nostalgia of aging Blanquists, the desperate cynicism of failed royalists, and the weekend jingoism of Parisian office-boys.\" The fact that the communists and monarchists who rallied to Boulanger agreed on little else mattered little \u2014 they had the same enemy, moderate parliamentarism. In Boulanger they saw what they wanted to see and assumed that it was their fellow-travelers who were the dupes. (Others were not taken in but saw Boulanger as a worthwhile gamble.

{"original_text": "ARHIES is usually caused by mutations in the DOCK8 gene. The protein produced from this gene plays a critical role in the survival and function of several types of immune system cells. One of the protein's functions is to help maintain the structure and integrity of immune cells called T cells and NK cells, which recognize and attack foreign invaders, particularly as these cells travel to sites of infection within the body. In addition, DOCK8 is involved in chemical signaling pathways that stimulate other immune cells called B cells to mature and produce antibodies, which are specialized proteins that attach to foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction. DOCK8 gene mutations result in the production of little or no functional DOCK8 protein. Shortage of this protein impairs normal immune cell development and function. It is thought that T cells and NK cells lacking DOCK8 cannot maintain their shape as they move through dense spaces, such as those found within the skin. The abnormal cells die, resulting in reduced numbers of these cells. A shortage of these immune cells impairs the immune response to foreign invaders, accounting for the severe viral skin infections common in ARHIES.

{"original_text": "You are smart to read books to better inform yourself of the investment process. I recommend reading some of the passive investment classics before focusing on active investment books: If you still feel like you can generate after-tax / after-expenses alpha (returns in excess of the market returns), take a shot at some active investing. If you actively invest, I recommend the Core & Satellite approach: invest most of your money in a well diversified basket of stocks via index funds and actively manage a small portion of your account. Carefully track the expenses and returns of the active portion of your account and see if you are one of the lucky few that can generate excess returns. To truly understand a text like The Intelligent Investor, you need to understand finance and accounting.

I recommend reading some of the passive investment classics before focusing on active investment books: If you still feel like you can generate after-tax / after-expenses alpha (returns in excess of the market returns), take a shot at some active investing. If you actively invest, I recommend the Core & Satellite approach: invest most of your money in a well diversified basket of stocks via index funds and actively manage a small portion of your account. Carefully track the expenses and returns of the active portion of your account and see if you are one of the lucky few that can generate excess returns.

Your refrigerator is cold while it's running, but the room overall is hotter because it's running; which is why you can't cool your house by leaving the fridge door open. A refrigeration cycle is a way to remove heat from one area and dump it into another area. In very general terms you've got some kind of working fluid that can absorb heat. It starts as a vapor, you compress this vapor into a liquid and then pump it over to the volume that you want to cool down. Then you let it evaporate and since that phase change energy has to come from somewhere it sucks heat out of the area around it. You take that vapor now and the cycle starts over.

{"original_text": "I would say no. Here's why. There are two important processes in play in high and low pressure systems, geostrophic wind balance, and friction at the surface, amung many other things. Geostrophic wind balance essentially tells us how fast the wind will be moving given a distribution of pressure. The closer the isobars (lines of constant pressure) are from each other, the faster the wind will become. The further the isobars are from each other, the slower the wind will become. Friction at the surface will cause the winds to converge toward a low pressure center, and diverge from a high pressure center. Now high and low pressure systems are very large (> 1000km). Let's say we have a low pressure center with a pressure of 980mb, over 1000km. Assuming that 1000mb is average, this means there is 20mb over 1000km, or 20 isobars over 1000km. Now if we shrink the low pressure to 100km and keep the pressure the same, there will be 20 isobars over 100km. The geostrophic wind will be 10x greater in the smaller low than the normal sized low. With a higher wind speed caused by the tighter isobars, there will be more wind moving toward the center, which will add mass to the low pressure system, and decrease the central low pressure, weakening the system. The winds the low creates actually acts to destroy itself. This is why low pressure centers need to be so large, so the winds converging toward to center don't start to fill the low with mass as quickly.

It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels. As a result, the body produces more insulin to compensate, but eventually, the pancreas is unable to keep up with the demand, and blood sugar levels rise. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with lifestyle factors, such as obesity, physical inactivity, and an unhealthy diet. It is also linked to genetic predisposition and age.

{"original_text": "An important question to ask about residual monarchism under the early Republic is whether a distinction was seen between the establishment of a new monarchy *a la* Yuan Shikai in 1915, and the restoration of the Manchu monarchy as was briefly attempted in 1917. The reason I bring this up is because Yuan was not attempting to'revive the Chinese monarchy', not least because the Qing were not Chinese and had a distinct style of ruling, but instead was trying to establish his own system, a centralised, nominally constitutional monarchy modelled after Japan or Germany. It's more than clear that a restoration of the Manchu Qing was very much off the table, even in the chaos following Yuan's death. Politics had moved on in the wake of the revolution, and while a few old moderate constitutionalists like Kang Youwei supported Puyi's restoration in 1917, the constitutionalist faction as a whole had since 1898 already moved in a more radical direction under the overall leadership of Liang Qichao. Under Liang's leadership, the Republican Party of Li Yuanhong, the the Unity party of Jiang Binglin and the Democratic Party of Tan Hualong merged into the pro-republican Jinbudang (JBD for convenience), or Progressive Party, in 1913 \u2013 ironically this was arguably the more politically moderate of the two major political parties, when compared to Sun Yat-Sen's Kuomintang (KMT), or Nationalist Party. The pro-Manchu Royalist Party was effectively unrepresented in the official channels of power, and its activities were primarily confined to anti-Republic sedition in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia \u2013 indeed in the event Zhang Xun's attempt at a restoration in 1917 was barely linked at all to the official Royalist movement, though it proved destabilising enough to lead to Li Yuanhong's resignation as President shortly following its suppression. It must also be noted that Manchu rule was a specific grievance of many anti-Qing elements, radical constitutionalists and revolutionary republicans alike, and so the reestablishment of foreign Manchu rule would have been markedly more unpalatable than a Han Chinese monarchy. However, Yuan may not have been totally delusional when he made his own bid at the throne. For one, the suppression of the Nationalist Party in November 1913 meant that, ostensibly, the most powerful ideological opposition to a new monarchy was gone. Voter turnout to the Assembly elections earlier that year had been quite low, and in any case the franchise was property-based, so although the the KMT gained a sizeable plurality in both houses of the National Congress, with 48% of the Senate and 45% of the House under their control, the Nationalists probably came to power off the back of a very vocal radical minority, with Yuan still in reasonable standing with the broadly moderate consensus. Although the JBD was a relatively distant second in the Assembly, holding only 22% and 26% of the seats in the higher and lower houses, respectively, that still left a substantial number of minor parties and independents who, in all, seem to have been moderates leaning either pro-Yuan or relatively neutral. Although Yuan dissolved the Assembly outright in January 1914, he took 66 of the remaining members to form a nominal rump Assembly, which although not very warmly received by the JBD, nonetheless seems to have been a relatively stable arrangement, which Yuan (at least in public) acknowledged as a temporary measure against radical derailment of the revolution. For another, Yuan's decision to declare a new monarchy must be seen in the context of a fundamental problem besetting the post-revolutionary order, namely that while the initial goals of the revolution itself, those being the overthrow of the Qing and establishment of a republican government, were shared by most major parties involved, there was very little agreement on how the republican state should be structured. In the last years of the Qing, the republican faction supported the idea of a strong state with popular mandate, whereas the radical constitutionalists had envisioned the continuation of the process of decentralisation begun with the emergency measures against the Taiping in the 1850s, with an end goal of establishing powerful regional governments representing elite interests answering to a central government similarly dominated by regional representatives of the property-owning elite. While Yuan had been no republican, he did not share the decentralising tendencies of the radical constitutionalists, either, but instead had generally been aligned with the more moderate constitutionalists of Kang Youwei, who had advocated a system in which imperial power was more circumscribed, but where power was nonetheless still invested in a central government balancing imperial and regional interests. Shan argues that Yuan, despite his distaste for the republicans, nonetheless was a centraliser, and that as such, he had always seen the presidency as a relatively autocratic role. In turn, the emperorship may well have appeared like a logical step forward in securing a restrengthened central government and arresting the particularising tendencies of the Late Qing. There's also the particular circumstances of the imperial appointment to consider. Yuan had in August 1915 begun investigating the possibility of establishing a monarchy, probably under the assumption that the JBD and similar would not particularly object to the replacement of the presidency with a monarchy given their former status as constitutionalists. And, in the event, the rump Assembly did approve and petition for Yuan's accession in December 1915. Obviously, said assembly was headed by Yuan's cronies, although he may not have been too far off regarding moderate interest in a new monarchy. The warlords of the provinces which first rebelled in the National Protection War following Yuan's attempted accession \u2013 Yunnan and Guizhou \u2013 were predominantly Japanese-educated former members of Sun Yat-Sen's Tongmenghui, and generally not radical constitutionalists, although there were of course exceptions. We must also consider that Yuan's information flow was increasingly being handled by a small clique of men, including his son, who allegedly bribed newspaper publishers in Beijing to produce special, erroneous copies for Yuan specifically, which may further have helped distort his view of the public's reception of a new imperial accession. In sum, then, Yuan's decision to establish a monarchy in 1915 was not entirely without good cause. Following the suppression of the KMT, the main political party was the successor to the late Qing constitutional monarchist faction, making the prospect of a monarchy a reasonably realistic one from a pragmatic standpoint; Yuan's own (mis)interpretation of the role of the presidency and general inclination towards centralisation made an imperial reestablishment appear like a relatively small step in the right direction; and Yuan's immediate supporters seem to have done much themselves to push Yuan towards the imperial title. In the event, we may never know for sure how far there was broad support for Yuan's monarchy given both its extreme brevity and the general dominance of regional and capital elite strongmen in political affairs. However, it must be said that there was at least the *perception* that certain people in the political class might not be disinclined to a new Han Chinese monarchy. What is probably certain is that there were very few enthusiastic about creating it. The republican revolution had done little to enfranchise the general public, whose political interests thus would have lain outside the official republican organs of power, and those military and plutocratic elites who had gained power thanks to the revolution, particularly in the wealthier south of China, were evidently not inclined to giving up their newfound authority, given the rapidity with which the anti-Yuan faction in the National Protection War spread. **Sources, Notes and References** * Patrick Fuliang Shan, *Yuan Shikai: A Reappraisal* (2018) * Ernest P.

Red Dead takes place in 1911, so I realize that the days of the large Indian conflicts were long past. But there certainly were a number of Native Americans living in Texas, New Mexico, and the Great Plains (the American areas that I've heard Red Dead is supposed to be based upon on). From what I recall, the only Native Americans you meet in the entire game are in Dutch's gang - the very worst of the bad guys. I don't think this was a conscious effort by Rockstar to demonize Native Americans, and it does fit in with the classic western motif of Indians as savages, but it made me uncomfortable. For a game that is all about the end of the West and the transition to modernity (which I don't think it actually portrayed or addressed very well), having a sympathetic Indian character through which to explore this shift would have gone a long way. Rockstar may have decided to avoid the Native American situation for political reasons, which I think is a lousy excuse.

But there certainly were a number of Native Americans living in Texas, New Mexico, and the Great Plains (the American areas that I've heard Red Dead is supposed to be based upon on). From what I recall, the only Native Americans you meet in the entire game are in Dutch's gang - the very worst of the bad guys. I don't think this was a conscious effort by Rockstar to demonize Native Americans, and it does fit in with the classic western motif of Indians as savages, but it made me uncomfortable. For a game that is all about the end of the West and the transition to modernity (which I don't think it actually portrayed or addressed very well), having a sympathetic Indian character through which to explore this shift would have gone a long way. Rockstar may have decided to avoid the Native American situation for political reasons, which I think is a lousy excuse. It's a real shame this dynamic of the West wasn't explored in Red Dead."}

EpsteinBarr virus infection increases the risk of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. Signs of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Tests that examine the lymph system are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system. Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymph system, which is part of the body's immune system. The immune system protects the body from foreign substances, infection, and diseases. The lymph system is made up of the following: Lymph: Colorless, watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system. Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors. Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream. Lymph nodes: Small, beanshaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body. Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, abdomen, pelvis, and groin. Spleen: An organ that makes lymphocytes, filters the blood, stores blood cells, and destroys old blood cells. The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach. Thymus: An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone. Tonsils: Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat. The tonsils make lymphocytes. Bone marrow: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of large bones. Bone marrow makes white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach, thyroid gland, brain, and skin. There are two general types of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma and nonHodgkin lymphoma.

Lee was a very complicated person and owned slaves himself. He does seem to express dislike for slavery as a system, but could treat his own slaves pretty badly at times. He certainly regarded them as property, which their owner could do with what they wanted. He certainly agonized about whether or not to join the Confederate Army. Many of his compatriots from Virginia that were in the military stayed and fought with the Union, rather than support their home state. However, we know that eventually Lee did decide to support Virginia and the Confederacy. It was not an easy decision for him to make though.

{"original_text": "I finished reading Brian Catlos' *Infidel Kings and Unholy Warriors* last night, and it's really good. I could totally nitpick here and there about characterisations I don't like or areas where I think his statements are a touch more sweeping than I'd like, but honestly that's basically just par for the course for anything written for a more general audience and not worth getting in a twist over. It does a lot of really great things, though, and it's definitely worth checking out if you're interested in the Crusades as a period rather than the narrative of the individual Crusades. Several of the things I really liked about it were: * All the al-Andalus stuff. I don't really study this area, so it was great to get a high level discussion of the *taifa* kings period and early Almoravid period. * The overall thesis of the book. Catlos is focusing on the relationships between Muslims, Christians, and Jews in this period and how regional and class concerns often transcended religious divides. It's a great antidote to a lot of pop culture depictions of the Crusading Period as being at its core a conflict of religions rather than a political conflict that featured a lot of religious people. * The Fatimids chapters. The Fatimids are often left to the periphery of Crusading histories - they're an important player but rarely is their story ever told from their perspective. Instead they are a passive state to be acted upon by the Abbasids and Crusaders.

I could totally nitpick here and there about characterisations I don't like or areas where I think his statements are a touch more sweeping than I'd like, but honestly that's basically just par for the course for anything written for a more general audience and not worth getting in a twist over. It does a lot of really great things, though, and it's definitely worth checking out if you're interested in the Crusades as a period rather than the narrative of the individual Crusades. Several of the things I really liked about it were: * All the al-Andalus stuff. I don't really study this area, so it was great to get a high level discussion of the *taifa* kings period and early Almoravid period. * The overall thesis of the book. Catlos is focusing on the relationships between Muslims, Christians, and Jews in this period and how regional and class concerns often transcended religious divides. It's a great antidote to a lot of pop culture depictions of the Crusading Period as being at its core a conflict of religions rather than a political conflict that featured a lot of religious people. * The Fatimids chapters. The Fatimids are often left to the periphery of Crusading histories - they're an important player but rarely is their story ever told from their perspective. Instead they are a passive state to be acted upon by the Abbasids and Crusaders. By telling their story from the perspective of the Fatimids themselves Catlos gives a really interesting perspective on their role in the period.

If you assume all the wiring in your house is 12-2, and that your house has 4,000 feet of wire, then you have 8,000 total feet of wire (4,000 to outlets and 4,000 back to the main).

{"original_text": "Just to be clear here, OCD is not just the stereotypical hand-washing-afraid-of-germs-can't-stand-asymmetry behavior made popular by the media. Not everyone with OCD has physical compulsions, and they certainly don't all involve \"cleanliness\". ICD defines it as: Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterised by the presence of either obsessions or compulsions, but commonly both. An obsession is defined as an unwanted intrusive thought, image or urge, which repeatedly enters the person's mind. Obsessions are distressing but are acknowledged as originating in the person's mind, and not imposed by an outside agency. They are usually regarded by the individual as unreasonable or excessive. A minority are regarded as having overvalued ideas (Veale, 2002) and, rarely, delusions. The person usually tries to resist an obsession, but in chronic cases this may be to a very minor degree or not at all. Unwanted intrusive thoughts, images or urges are almost universal in the general population and their content is usually indistinguishable from clinical obsessions (Rachman & de Silva, 1978). Examples include having the urge to push someone under a train or a thought that the cooker has been left on. According to current psychological models, the difference between a normal intrusive thought and an obsessional thought is the meaning that OCD patients attach to the occurrence and/or content of the intrusions. Individuals with OCD tend to believe that intrusive thoughts and urges are dangerous or immoral and that they are able to prevent harm occurring either to their self or a vulnerable person (Salkovskis et al., 1995). Compulsions are repetitive behaviours or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform. A compulsion can either be overt and observable by others, such as checking that a door is locked, or a covert mental act that cannot be observed as in repeating a certain phrase in the mind. Covert compulsions are generally more difficult to resist or monitor than overt ones as they are can be performed anywhere without others knowing and are easier to perform. A compulsion is not in itself pleasurable which differentiates it from impulsive acts, such as shopping or gambling, that are associated with immediate gratification. The term \"ritual\" is synonymous with compulsion but usually refers to behaviours that other people can see. This is how DSM IV defines the criteria for OCD: A. Either obsessions or compulsions: Obsessions as defined by (1), (2), (3), and (4): (1) recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are experienced at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and inappropriate and that cause marked anxiety or distress (2) the thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems (3) the person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action (4) the person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind (not imposed from without as in thought insertion) Compulsions as defined by (1) and (2): (1) repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly (2) the behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts either are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent or are clearly excessive B. At some point during the course of the disorder, the person has recognized that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable. Note: This does not apply to children. C.

D.

{"original_text": "This is a tricky question to answer for a number of reasons. Firstly, the official stance of the USSR from the 1930s onward was that unemployment, like other social ills that characterized monopoly capitalism such as homelessness, did not exist in the Soviet Union. Although the Eastern bloc states did keep tabs on their unemployed, the states' treated unemployment as an individual's own fault. The Soviet constitutions guaranteed an right for employment for all Soviet citizens and therefore if an individual did not take advantage of this, they were somehow asocial and abnormal according to the state. How the state reacted to this asociality depended heavily upon both historical timing and specific context. The most dangerous time to be \"that guy\" on the Soviet shopfloor was the Stalinist industrialization drive of the 1930s, especially during the Great Terror. Factory managers were under intense pressure to meet quotas and uncover evidence of wrecking and sabotage by enemies of the Soviet state. As such, an individual working in a factory without a good work ethic was an ideal candidate for scapegoating the shortfalls of the first Five Year Plans. The Stalinist period also saw the unmuzzling of Soviet policing and Soviet police often sought to prune out the undesirable elements in society, including vagrants and layabouts. Depending upon the seriousness of the charges for shirking, sentences could range from death, to factory discipline, or assignment to a GULAG. The GULAGs themselves had a high turnover/release rate of around 30% during the Stalinist period, but were brutal and harsh labor camps. The attitude of the Soviet state to those sentenced to the GULAGs for shirking work or other asocial crimes was that hard labor would reform these individuals and the GULAGs operated on the principle of \"he who does not work, does not eat.\" Gulag rations were often quite mean and the corv\u00e9e labor had little to no safety standards. The German invasion sharpened the Soviet state's attitude towards shirking and other signs a Soviet citizen was not doing their part. The loss of so much agricultural land to the Germans meant that between 1941-1943, the only segments of the Soviet population that were adequately fed were the military and the workers in war production factories. The simple fact that workplace canteens were one of the few areas available for Soviet citizens not in uniform to supplement their meager rations was an incentive to show up for work. While the Stalin period witnessed the harshest approach to shiftlessness, the state's concern for those unwilling to work did not go away with Stalin. In both the Thaw and the early Brezhnev period, there was a persistent concern with youth hooliganism and the inability of for Soviet youth to shape up and take their place as workers. Soviet police often enacted harsh penalties for crimes they associated with youth hooliganism. Some of these \"crimes\" could be as innocuous as picking flowers on a road and hanging out in a park afterwards. The post-Stalinist state also sought to deal with problems like homelessness by shipping individuals to areas inside the Soviet interior where the police would keep an eye on them. Part of the problem with the Soviet perspective on unemployment was that the Soviet state was of two minds about the nature of work, and these ideas were somewhat contradictory. Om one hand, the Soviet state enshrined the idea that work was a natural right of the proletariat and the planned economy would resolve all the issues of shortages and overwork. The Soviets also held themselves up as the paragon of the worker's state in which the toiling classes would be able to enjoy a full life of leisure and cultural fulfillment. The problem was that the Soviet state could never really deliver on both promises. Soviet industry was never really able to deliver the masses the promised consumer goods in appreciable quantity and were chronically inefficient. The guarantee of work also meant that Soviet firms often maintained an excess number of workers for the tasks needed, with much duplication of effort and wastage. The Soviets were hesitant to introduce any innovations in management for production beyond the Taylorism of the 1920s. The typical Soviet factory often went through periods of relative inactivity to frenzied work hours to meet quotas (the best analogy I have to this is it is the postwar Soviet factory life is like a typical American college student work ethos- there is a lot of minor stuff in the semester punctuated by all-nighters as test and paper dates loom). The Soviet commitment to education meant that this was one avenue to go down if one wanted to opt out on factory life. The over-stuffed employment often meant Soviet graduate students often tried to find work in the boiler rooms of various state-run buildings. By the late Soviet period, \"Boiler-room jobs\" became a slang term meaning a sinecure that allowed a Soviet citizen to engage in other activities, such as doctoral research or forming their own garage band. Of course, gaining a boiler room job was highly dependent upon access. *Blat*, meaning influence or sway, was a vital aspect of navigating the Soviet system.

Firstly, the official stance of the USSR from the 1930s onward was that unemployment, like other social ills that characterized monopoly capitalism such as homelessness, did not exist in the Soviet Union. Although the Eastern bloc states did keep tabs on their unemployed, the states' treated unemployment as an individual's own fault. The Soviet constitutions guaranteed an right for employment for all Soviet citizens and therefore if an individual did not take advantage of this, they were somehow asocial and abnormal according to the state. How the state reacted to this asociality depended heavily upon both historical timing and specific context. The most dangerous time to be \"that guy\" on the Soviet shopfloor was the Stalinist industrialization drive of the 1930s, especially during the Great Terror. Factory managers were under intense pressure to meet quotas and uncover evidence of wrecking and sabotage by enemies of the Soviet state. As such, an individual working in a factory without a good work ethic was an ideal candidate for scapegoating the shortfalls of the first Five Year Plans. The Stalinist period also saw the unmuzzling of Soviet policing and Soviet police often sought to prune out the undesirable elements in society, including vagrants and layabouts. Depending upon the seriousness of the charges for shirking, sentences could range from death, to factory discipline, or assignment to a GULAG. The GULAGs themselves had a high turnover/release rate of around 30% during the Stalinist period, but were brutal and harsh labor camps. The attitude of the Soviet state to those sentenced to the GULAGs for shirking work or other asocial crimes was that hard labor would reform these individuals and the GULAGs operated on the principle of \"he who does not work, does not eat.\" Gulag rations were often quite mean and the corv\u00e9e labor had little to no safety standards. The German invasion sharpened the Soviet state's attitude towards shirking and other signs a Soviet citizen was not doing their part. The loss of so much agricultural land to the Germans meant that between 1941-1943, the only segments of the Soviet population that were adequately fed were the military and the workers in war production factories. The simple fact that workplace canteens were one of the few areas available for Soviet citizens not in uniform to supplement their meager rations was an incentive to show up for work. While the Stalin period witnessed the harshest approach to shiftlessness, the state's concern for those unwilling to work did not go away with Stalin. In both the Thaw and the early Brezhnev period, there was a persistent concern with youth hooliganism and the inability of for Soviet youth to shape up and take their place as workers. Soviet police often enacted harsh penalties for crimes they associated with youth hooliganism. Some of these \"crimes\" could be as innocuous as picking flowers on a road and hanging out in a park afterwards. The post-Stalinist state also sought to deal with problems like homelessness by shipping individuals to areas inside the Soviet interior where the police would keep an eye on them. Part of the problem with the Soviet perspective on unemployment was that the Soviet state was of two minds about the nature of work, and these ideas were somewhat contradictory. Om one hand, the Soviet state enshrined the idea that work was a natural right of the proletariat and the planned economy would resolve all the issues of shortages and overwork. The Soviets also held themselves up as the paragon of the worker's state in which the toiling classes would be able to enjoy a full life of leisure and cultural fulfillment. The problem was that the Soviet state could never really deliver on both promises. Soviet industry was never really able to deliver the masses the promised consumer goods in appreciable quantity and were chronically inefficient. The guarantee of work also meant that Soviet firms often maintained an excess number of workers for the tasks needed, with much duplication of effort and wastage. The Soviets were hesitant to introduce any innovations in management for production beyond the Taylorism of the 1920s. The typical Soviet factory often went through periods of relative inactivity to frenzied work hours to meet quotas (the best analogy I have to this is it is the postwar Soviet factory life is like a typical American college student work ethos- there is a lot of minor stuff in the semester punctuated by all-nighters as test and paper dates loom). The Soviet commitment to education meant that this was one avenue to go down if one wanted to opt out on factory life. The over-stuffed employment often meant Soviet graduate students often tried to find work in the boiler rooms of various state-run buildings. By the late Soviet period, \"Boiler-room jobs\" became a slang term meaning a sinecure that allowed a Soviet citizen to engage in other activities, such as doctoral research or forming their own garage band. Of course, gaining a boiler room job was highly dependent upon access. *Blat*, meaning influence or sway, was a vital aspect of navigating the Soviet system.

{"original_text": "The \"X\" is a surname-like identifier given to members of the Nation of Islam (NOI)--the organization that all of these men were in. As for the number, those were given out based on one's first name. In each city, the NOI has a temple/mosque and the first person who joined that temple with a particular first name was simply given the \"surname\" X. So the first John at the NY temple was given the name John X. The second John who joined was given the name John 2X. Etc. So Norman 3X means he was the third Norman to join his temple (which I believe was Newark's temple, No. 25). Now, because the naming system was temple-based, people could be from different temples and have the same name. So for instance, in the 50s and 60s there were 2 prominent NOI figures named John 3X, one from Chicago and one from Newark. As for the why they were given the X name.... First of all, you should know that when the NOI started in the 1930s, almost no one in the group got an X. Instead, the NOI founder, WD Fard, personally gave members more traditional sounding Muslim surnames, like Sharreiff, Karreim, and Muhammad. That is why the NOI's later famous leader Elijah Muhammad, who joined in the early 30s, has that surname. In the 1940s, it was explained that the reason the X started being used was because the NOI believed that only Fard himself could give out a \"righteous\" name, so after his departure in 1934 new members were supposedly given the X name as a placeholder, X being the standard placeholder (ie variable) in mathematics, and it was expected that Fard would one day resturn as a Messiah in an Armageddon and give all the people with Xs their \"righteous\" names. (This connecting of the X with Armageddon, by the way, suggests that the X name was looked upon by early members as having deep cullture meaning, since black folk religion since the 19th c contained the idea that the symbol X was a sign of black people and their expected redemption from oppression, as foretold [they said] in the 7th chapter of the Book of Revelation. The X was therefore seen as a magical, important symbol.) But It was also said that even in the early days, when new members were waiting to hear back from Fard with their new names, at that time they too were given an X, so the Armageddon stuff came later. However, that 1940s report seems to imply that even after Fard left, for a few years his ministers (like Elijah Muhammad) had the ability to give righteous names too. And in fact when dozens of NOI members were arrested in the 1940s and had their names appear in the newspapers, NOT ONE had the surname of X (although 1 FBI report from that time does mention someone using it, and oral reports attest to it.) So it seems the group was rather inconsistent at about the X name at that time. However, upon the inprisonment of many members in the 40s, Elijah Muhammad started changing and standardizing many NOI practices, including the giving of the X. Thus, by 1950 pretty much all new members were consistently given the X name. And in the 1960s, new explanations had appeared for its use. Now it was emphasized that the X stood for the unknown, just as the African family names of the slaves were unknown, and the X served to replace the \"slave name\" --ie the surnames African Americans had received from slavemasters. (By the way, the earliest recorded black Muslim use of the term \"slave name\" comes not from NOI members, but from Members of the Moorish Science Temple, which preceded and influenced the NOI.) But, that is still not the whole story. Even after Elijah Muhammad's reforms, he still sometimes gave his ministers the surname Shabazz (which is the name of the tribe, according to NOI theology, from which African Americans are decended.) And sometimes, despite it going against the official NOI rules, members gave themselves and their kids traditional Muslim names, first and last. This is the original of the surname of the famous rapper Tupac Shakur. The Shakur name was adopted by certain NOI Muslims from the same family in New York. These Muslims were well respected followers of Malcolm, so when Malcolm died and they joined the Black Panthers, other people they knew took the Shakur name out of respect for that family (eg the notorious Assata Shakur). Tupac's mom Afeni had a relationship with a Shakur, which is how she got the name, plus she was close to other Shakurs, including Assata. After Elijah died in 1975, his son Wallace dissolved the NOI, made the community Sunni, and therefore abandoned the use of the X, letting everyone take Muslim names.

{"original_text": "Well, this might not be an orthodox view, but it's still a view many neuroscientists hold. It's the idea that there are two competing sources of influence in your brain. One is retrospective and shaped by phylogenetic and ontogenetic conditioning. The other is prospective and based on mental representations of your environment. Roger Sperry wrote about downward causation in 1993. Since then (well, also before), this has become a topic of interest to many researchers. The idea of complex systems defying determinism is under a lot of discussion. You can think of it as having to do with consequences. If an animal does something that leads to its death, that's a consequence with a significant impact. The species will be shaped by individual occurrences of this sort. In the same manner, if through random genetic mutations an animal ends up with something that leads to better consequences, this mutation will be \"favored\" by evolution. The past of a species shapes its future. Even in the life of a single specimen this is the case. If you give a dog electric shocks whenever it is located in a certain area of its cage, it will avoid this area. If it is given morphine in an area, it will spend a lot of time in this area. Its behavior is shaped by classical and operant conditioning in addition to evolutionary (phylogenetic) selection (or non-random elimination, if you will). The point is that the consequences come first, and the outcomes after. This is important. In the basal ganglia, habits are acquired and selected for based on consequences. Its direct dopaminergic pathway, employing D1-family-receptors, learns beneficial consequences (leading to approach motivation). The indirect pathway, employing D2-family-receptors, learns detrimental consquences (leading to avoidance motivation). Meanwhile, something interesting is going on in the neocortex, and especially in the prefrontal cortex. Somehow, we have become able to reverse-engineer this process. By constructing a mental representation of our environment in our hippocampus, we can use this representation to do something really cool. We can start with an outcome, and work out the consequences that would take us there. \"I want to learn how to play guitar,\" you might think. Even if you've never before played guitar, you should have representations in your brain that can help you reverse-engineer your way to success. Perhaps your idea is that skill is a consequence of training, training is a consequence of discipline, and discipline is a consequence of good teaching. So you sign up for lessons. Congratulations; you just acted in a way that defied the evolutionary shaping of your species and the conditioned responses you have attained in your lifetime by an act of will. So how does this work? One idea is that this has got to do with prediction. The idea that the neocortex extracts the statistical regularities of its environment and uses this information to form predictions is pretty popular. The idea that dopamine is used as a signal that gauges deviations from expected consequences is also pretty solid (the reward prediction error hypothesis). With this, we have the competition of conditioned and planned responses. Let's say you sit down to study. Based on conditioning, you might rather want to watch Netflix. Retrospective control, as we can call it, is only concerned with immediate consequences because that's the way this system works. Immdiate consequences--good or bad--are learned and used to predict outcomes. Prospective control we can call this other system. This system also predicts outcomes, but it does it, as we mentioned, backwards. It starts with the desired outcome and finds consequences that will lead to the expected outcome. Let's say the desired outcome is an A. A is the consequence is hard studying, you might believe, and so you sit down and open your textbook. Or you might have an undesired outcome (flunking), and believe that the consequences of not studying will lead to this outcome. This is also based on prospective control. What determines whether you will be influenced by the retrospective or prospective system? It's hard to say. But there are clues that neuromodulation plays a big part. Deprive a rat of serotonin, and it will not be able to control its impulses. It will fail the marshmallow test. So levels of serotonin should be important for being able to use the prospective system. What controls levels of serotonin? The major influence on the raphe nuclei is the lateral habenula. This is an evolutionary ancient epithalamic structure (you can find it in lampreys). It seems that this structure can act as a sort of test mechanism for your mental representations/prefrontal cortex. If you expected that action A would lead to desired outcome B and it didn't, the lateral habenula is excited. If it led to an even better outcome than predicted, the lateral habenula is inhibited. And the lateral habenula influences the neuromodulation of serotonin based on this information, in effect deciding whether your plans are \"trustworthy\" enough to allocate control to the prospective system. Too much failure, and you should stick to the tried and true retrospective system. This might not be the full story, but I believe it's better than the awful glucose hypothesis of willpower.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Well, this might not be an orthodox view, but it's still a view many neuroscientists hold.

In the same manner, if through random genetic mutations an animal ends up with something that leads to better consequences, this mutation will be \"favored\" by evolution. The past of a species shapes its future. Even in the life of a single specimen this is the case. If you give a dog electric shocks whenever it is located in a certain area of its cage, it will avoid this area. If it is given morphine in an area, it will spend a lot of time in this area. Its behavior is shaped by classical and operant conditioning in addition to evolutionary (phylogenetic) selection (or non-random elimination, if you will). The point is that the consequences come first, and the outcomes after. This is important. In the basal ganglia, habits are acquired and selected for based on consequences. Its direct dopaminergic pathway, employing D1-family-receptors, learns beneficial consequences (leading to approach motivation). The indirect pathway, employing D2-family-receptors, learns detrimental consquences (leading to avoidance motivation). Meanwhile, something interesting is going on in the neocortex, and especially in the prefrontal cortex. Somehow, we have become able to reverse-engineer this process. By constructing a mental representation of our environment in our hippocampus, we can use this representation to do something really cool. We can start with an outcome, and work out the consequences that would take us there. \"I want to learn how to play guitar,\" you might think. Even if you've never before played guitar, you should have representations in your brain that can help you reverse-engineer your way to success. Perhaps your idea is that skill is a consequence of training, training is a consequence of discipline, and discipline is a consequence of good teaching. So you sign up for lessons. Congratulations; you just acted in a way that defied the evolutionary shaping of your species and the conditioned responses you have attained in your lifetime by an act of will. So how does this work? One idea is that this has got to do with prediction. The idea that the neocortex extracts the statistical regularities of its environment and uses this information to form predictions is pretty popular. The idea that dopamine is used as a signal that gauges deviations from expected consequences is also pretty solid (the reward prediction error hypothesis). With this, we have the competition of conditioned and planned responses. Let's say you sit down to study. Based on conditioning, you might rather want to watch Netflix. Retrospective control, as we can call it, is only concerned with immediate consequences because that's the way this system works. Immdiate consequences--good or bad--are learned and used to predict outcomes. Prospective control we can call this other system. This system also predicts outcomes, but it does it, as we mentioned, backwards. It starts with the desired outcome and finds consequences that will lead to the expected outcome. Let's say the desired outcome is an A. A is the consequence is hard studying, you might believe, and so you sit down and open your textbook. Or you might have an undesired outcome (flunking), and believe that the consequences of not studying will lead to this outcome. This is also based on prospective control. What determines whether you will be influenced by the retrospective or prospective system? It's hard to say. But there are clues that neuromodulation plays a big part. Deprive a rat of serotonin, and it will not be able to control its impulses. It will fail the marshmallow test. So levels of serotonin should be important for being able to use the prospective system. What controls levels of serotonin? The major influence on the raphe nuclei is the lateral habenula. This is an evolutionary ancient epithalamic structure (you can find it in lampreys). It seems that this structure can act as a sort of test mechanism for your mental representations/prefrontal cortex. If you expected that action A would lead to desired outcome B and it didn't, the lateral habenula is excited. If it led to an even better outcome than predicted, the lateral habenula is inhibited. And the lateral habenula influences the neuromodulation of serotonin based on this information, in effect deciding whether your plans are \"trustworthy\" enough to allocate control to the prospective system. Too much failure, and you should stick to the tried and true retrospective system. This might not be the full story, but I believe it's better than the awful glucose hypothesis of willpower."}

It's relatively easy for the layperson to understand and there is a lot of popular interest in certain types of military weapon systems - tanks and fighter jets in particular. In reality, these differences really don't matter much on a strategic level. Wars are very complex and messy affairs and there are a *lot* of factors involved that have nothing to do with the quality of the equipment. Things such as doctrine, average training levels, logistics, terrain, intelligence and coordination between different military branches all matter a lot more than having a tank that is slightly better than the enemy's tank. It doesn't matter if you have the best tank in the world if it isn't in the right place at the right time, and things like reliability and strategic mobility help a lot with that. A lot of military thinking centers around gaining *local superiority* - an advantage at the right place at the right time.

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Valinemia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance Drowsiness Failure to thrive Hyperkinesis Hypervalinemia Muscle weakness Vomiting The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom.

Abnormally low muscle tone (hypotonia); hyperkinesia; hyperactivity; excessive drowsiness; and delayed mental and physical development have also been reported. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Valinemia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance Drowsiness Failure to thrive Hyperkinesis Hypervalinemia Muscle weakness Vomiting The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."}

{"original_text": "To understand high blood cholesterol (koLESterol), it helps to learn about cholesterol. Cholesterol is a waxy, fatlike substance thats found in all cells of the body. Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods. Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs. However, cholesterol also is found in some of the foods you eat. Cholesterol travels through your bloodstream in small packages called lipoproteins (lipoPROteens). These packages are made of fat (lipid) on the inside and proteins on the outside. Two kinds of lipoproteins carry cholesterol throughout your body: lowdensity lipoproteins (LDL) and highdensity lipoproteins (HDL). Having healthy levels of both types of lipoproteins is important. LDL cholesterol sometimes is called bad cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. (Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body.) HDL cholesterol sometimes is called good cholesterol. This is because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver removes the cholesterol from your body. What Is High Blood Cholesterol? High blood cholesterol is a condition in which you have too much cholesterol in your blood. By itself, the condition usually has no signs or symptoms. Thus, many people dont know that their cholesterol levels are too high. People who have high blood cholesterol have a greater chance of getting coronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease. (In this article, the term heart disease refers to coronary heart disease.) The higher the level of LDL cholesterol in your blood, the GREATER your chance is of getting heart disease. The higher the level of HDL cholesterol in your blood, the LOWER your chance is of getting heart disease. Coronary heart disease is a condition in which plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary (heart) arteries. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ATHerosklerOsis). Atherosclerosis Over time, plaque hardens and narrows your coronary arteries. This limits the flow of oxygenrich blood to the heart. Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). This causes a blood clot to form on the surface of the plaque. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery. If the flow of oxygenrich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, angina (anJInuh or ANjuhnuh) or a heart attack may occur. Angina is chest pain or discomfort. It may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The pain also may occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion. A heart attack occurs if the flow of oxygenrich blood to a section of heart muscle is cut off. If blood flow isnt restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. Without quick treatment, a heart attack can lead to serious problems or death. Plaque also can build up in other arteries in your body, such as the arteries that bring oxygenrich blood to your brain and limbs. This can lead to problems such as carotid artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Outlook Lowering your cholesterol may slow, reduce, or even stop the buildup of plaque in your arteries. It also may reduce the risk of plaque rupturing and causing dangerous blood clots.

{"original_text": "Well it's not like the heme group take a look at some incoming possible substrate molecule and decides it likes the one it already has better. The way these things work is that you have an equilibrium, where a certain proportion of the substrate molecules will be bound, and a certain portion will be in solution, and the individual molecules move back and forth, while the proportions stay the same. Heme-CO (bound) < -- > Heme + CO (solution) What those proportions are depend on how strongly the molecule binds. If it binds more strongly, then a higher proportion of the molecules will be in the bound state. So the situation could be that you have 90% of O2 bound to heme and 10% in solution, while with CO it'd be 99% vs 1%. (qualitatively but not quantitatively accurate numbers since I can't bother to look up the actual ones). So you have a situation where both these molecules are competing with each other, but CO wins out. But if you take someone with carbon monoxide poisoning away from the CO gas and give them pure oxygen, you increase the amount of O2 in solution in the blood, allowing a corresponding increase in O2 bound to the heme. At the same time the fraction of CO that's in solution in the blood may escape through the lungs, and since there's no new CO around, that concentration will go down with time. The equilibrium strives to keep that 1%-99% proportion so as CO gets lost from solution in the blood, it gets replaced with CO previously bound to the hemes. Now, molecules can bind so strongly that for all intents the reaction is irreversible and there is no equilibrium worth talking about. Perhaps only one trillionth of the molecules of that type are in solution rather than 1%. This is the case with cyanide ions, which bind to heme even more strongly than CO does. (again that's not the exact number) In that case you do not recover by breathing oxygen for a while, because the cyanide doesn't dissociate and leave through the lungs to any appreciable extent.

{"original_text": "Ok, I know assumptions are bad here, but it simply has to do with the consumer culture of the post war period and the scarcity of the Great Depression if WWII is the turning point of the industry. If someone can refute that, I'd be pretty surprised. Before the war, people simply couldn't have a lot of material wealth because of the Great Depression. And, according to Nash in \"The American People\" ~40% of people in the Roaring'20s had practically no purchasing power because of their low wages and could be defined as living in poverty. Heck, he says that when the Great Depression happened, there wasn't a lack of goods and products, but there weren't enough consumers. These were people who were living paycheck to paycheck and there's no way they could have afforded the expense. The 50s really was a time where Americans could buy a lot of stuff. We were the sole industrial power left in the world, the Marshall plan ensured trade, and the American worker had it good and could buy a house, car, appliances, etc. That all really came to be an important part of the American dream. With materialism/consumerism comes excess and people needed a place to put their stuff and we get storage. And, of course, the surplus income to be able to afford it. I think that's going to be your post-WWII turning point. Urbanization is probably going to be a factor too. Smaller living spaces demand extra room for the extra stuff you can buy. And a much larger portion of the population was still farming before WWII. I'd imagine that serving a rural area really isn't good for self-storage because of the low population density and the fact that they would have had much more space to store their stuff. Side question: do you guys actually sell stuff in unpaid lockers and how does it really go down? I'm actually free this summer after July since I'm doing a decent chunk of the PCT. However, I'm only undergrad. But I'd do good work for you if you're interested and think that the project will only be ~2 months of good work. What exactly are you looking for in terms of length and complexity? edit: to back this up a little, here's a quote from wiki, sourced from: The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War II by William H. Chafe \"the ordinary individual has access to amenities \u2013 foods, entertainments, personal transportation, and plumbing \u2013 in which not even the rich rejoiced a century ago.\"[26] Consumerism represented one of the consequences (as well as one of the key ingredients) of the postwar economic boom. The initial quest for cars, appliances, and new furniture after the end of World War II quickly expanded into the mass consumption of goods, services, and recreational materials during the Fifties. Between 1945 and 1960, GNP grew by 250%, expenditures on new construction multiplied nine times, and consumption on personal services increased three times. By 1960, per capita income was 35% higher than in 1945, and America had entered what the economist Walt Rostow referred to as the \"high mass consumption\" stage of economic development. Short-term credit went up from $8.4 billion in 1946 to $45.6 billion in 1958. As a result of the postwar economic boom, 60% of the American population had attained a \"middle-class\" standard of living by the mid-50s (defined as incomes of $3,000 to $10,000 in constant dollars), compared with only 31% in the last year of prosperity before the onset of the Great Depression. By the end of the decade, 87% of families owned a TV set, 75% a car, and 75% a washing machine. Between 1947 and 1960, the average real income for American workers increased by as much as it had in the previous half-century.[27] As noted by the historian Nancy Wierek: \"In the postwar period, the majority of Americans were affluent in the sense that they were in a position to spend money on many things they wanted, desired, or chose to have, rather than on necessities alone.\" Basically, the point that I'm trying to make is that the post-WWII era sees an explosion in Americans owning stuff.

If someone can refute that, I'd be pretty surprised. Before the war, people simply couldn't have a lot of material wealth because of the Great Depression. And, according to Nash in \"The American People\" ~40% of people in the Roaring'20s had practically no purchasing power because of their low wages and could be defined as living in poverty. Heck, he says that when the Great Depression happened, there wasn't a lack of goods and products, but there weren't enough consumers. These were people who were living paycheck to paycheck and there's no way they could have afforded the expense. The 50s really was a time where Americans could buy a lot of stuff. We were the sole industrial power left in the world, the Marshall plan ensured trade, and the American worker had it good and could buy a house, car, appliances, etc. That all really came to be an important part of the American dream. With materialism/consumerism comes excess and people needed a place to put their stuff and we get storage. And, of course, the surplus income to be able to afford it. I think that's going to be your post-WWII turning point. Urbanization is probably going to be a factor too. Smaller living spaces demand extra room for the extra stuff you can buy. And a much larger portion of the population was still farming before WWII. I'd imagine that serving a rural area really isn't good for self-storage because of the low population density and the fact that they would have had much more space to store their stuff. Side question: do you guys actually sell stuff in unpaid lockers and how does it really go down? I'm actually free this summer after July since I'm doing a decent chunk of the PCT.

What exactly are you looking for in terms of length and complexity? edit: to back this up a little, here's a quote from wiki, sourced from: The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War II by William H. Chafe \"the ordinary individual has access to amenities \u2013 foods, entertainments, personal transportation, and plumbing \u2013 in which not even the rich rejoiced a century ago.\"[26] Consumerism represented one of the consequences (as well as one of the key ingredients) of the postwar economic boom. The initial quest for cars, appliances, and new furniture after the end of World War II quickly expanded into the mass consumption of goods, services, and recreational materials during the Fifties. Between 1945 and 1960, GNP grew by 250%, expenditures on new construction multiplied nine times, and consumption on personal services increased three times. By 1960, per capita income was 35% higher than in 1945, and America had entered what the economist Walt Rostow referred to as the \"high mass consumption\" stage of economic development. Short-term credit went up from $8.4 billion in 1946 to $45.6 billion in 1958. As a result of the postwar economic boom, 60% of the American population had attained a \"middle-class\" standard of living by the mid-50s (defined as incomes of $3,000 to $10,000 in constant dollars), compared with only 31% in the last year of prosperity before the onset of the Great Depression. By the end of the decade, 87% of families owned a TV set, 75% a car, and 75% a washing machine. Between 1947 and 1960, the average real income for American workers increased by as much as it had in the previous half-century.[27] As noted by the historian Nancy Wierek: \"In the postwar period, the majority of Americans were affluent in the sense that they were in a position to spend money on many things they wanted, desired, or chose to have, rather than on necessities alone.\" Basically, the point that I'm trying to make is that the post-WWII era sees an explosion in Americans owning stuff.

{"original_text": "Well, one answer to why psychology was more popular in the 1880s than previously, is that psychology's official origin date is often held to be 1879. This was the date when Wilhelm Wundt started the first experimental psychology laboratory focused on generating new research (with William James in America also having a parallel claim). Before this - with exceptions like Gustav Fechner's psychophysics or Wundt with his'thoughtmeter' - psychology was essentially just a branch of philosophy (and one which had seen a lot of philosophical work since Descartes had identified consciousness as the founding principle of epistemology with the whole'I think therefore I am' thing). However, the kind of psychology that, say, Wilhelm Wundt did - focused on determining the nature of the mind, not necessarily on mental illness - is not really what you're asking about, I think. Instead, I think what you're largely interested in is *psychiatry*. For context, the usual definition of'psychology' is'the scientific study of mind and behaviour' - it's a scientific discipline which aims to understand how humans think and behave much more generally. In contrast, psychiatry is the subdiscipline of medicine, in which medical doctors specialise in mental health. There are also specialists within psychology, clinical psychologists, who focus on mental health, but clinical psychologists, more or less, date from after World War II. Medical doctors who've been focused on scientific/entirely physical explanations for mental illness (something which distinguishes them from more magical approaches to mental illness, which have likely been around as long as mental illness) have been around since Hippocrates and people in his tradition, but it was around the turn of the 19th century that you get'moral treatment', in which treatment of the mentally ill by medical doctors was focused on putting the mentally ill in more healthy situations and coming to understand who the patient was and where they were at - previously, to the extent that doctors paid attention to mental health, they had often advocated mental health treatments as advanced as bloodletting and chaining people up in mental asylums. This kind of moral treatment became rapidly more common over the course of the 19th century (leading to problems of its own, as the asylums of the era became very overcrowded and thus not particularly healthy as per their original purpose). Even with the problems caused by overcrowding, you could certainly argue moral treatment led to an increased *medicalisation* of mental illness in Western societies where the moral treatment movement had been successful. Previous to this, mental illness was rarely seen as or treated as medical, but was instead treated within a community (rather than by doctors) and was seen as a combination of afflictions of the spirit and/or simply inherited and unchangeable (and so not worth medically treating). By the 1880s, you begin to get a particularly medicalised idea of mental illness, as advocated by the likes Emil Kraepelin, who framed diagnoses like *dementia praecox* (what we'd now call schizophrenia) as medical diagnoses in a way that would look familiar to those familiar with modern DSM diagnoses, and who attempted to find causal factors causing these mental illnesses (e.g., Kraepelin thought that schizophrenia was effectively early onset dementia). Similarly, over the course of the 19th century, the understanding of the physiology of the brain and the nervous system increased in leaps and bounds. You get widely publicised cases like Phineas Gage, who survived a railway spike through the head, but whose personality was seemingly altered, or'Tan', a French man who had brain damage to a part of the brain that's now called Broca's Area (after Paul Broca, the doctor who investigated Tan's brain after his death). Tan's brain lesions made him unable to say any word but'Tan'; while this now reminds us of a certain Game of Thrones character, it showed in interesting ways that the brain was specialised to do different tasks to some extent. Similarly, a young Sigmund Freud in the 1870s did physiological research in the laboratory of Ernst Brucke, comparing aspects of the human nervous system under a microscope to equivalent bits of animal nervous systems (Brucke's work helped pave the way for the discovery of the neuron as the basic component of the brain was first figured out in the late 1880s by Santiago Ramon y Cajal). Additionally, in 1859, you get Darwin's *Origin Of Species*, which implied that humans were simply evolved creatures that were entirely material in origin and nature - including our brains and minds. This was unsurprisingly a big influence on early psychology and psychiatry (and especially on Freud, whose theorising about sex is directly derived from Darwinian ideas about sexual selection). Furthermore, during the 19th century, you get the increasing professionalisation of the university along the German model, which was very influential worldwide, and which provided a model by which there could be professional scientific and medical researchers. The medical profession, in the German model, was increasingly focused on scientific research and how that could be applied to the treatment of patients, in a way that was not previously emphasised so strenuously. During the 1870s/1880s, to again use Freud as an example, whilst a student at university he fairly seamlessly transititioned from physiological research to graduating as a medical doctor when he could not secure a full-time position in Brucke's lab. This all came together, unsurprisingly, in a certain level of public curiosity about psychology and psychiatry, though popular interest in psychology and psychiatry has basically continued to increase across the 20th century and beyond, seeing we live in a world where people are'triggered', perhaps by other people with'inferiority complexes' who only think they have high'IQs', and where we're'reinforced' for acting in certain ways by governments full of'narcissists' and'psychopaths' who think they're'idiots'.

So even though it's in the centre of the galaxy, we really orbit within the total gravitational field of all the stars and gas and dark matter of the galaxy, and the supermassive black hole is just a small addition to this."}

You'll probably have to read a variety of sources very critically to form a fair picture. That being said, here's a take that would be fairly familiar to modern students of economics. The monetary system is unavoidably complex. Governments generally attempt to keep it reasonably stable while accomplishing other goals. However the supply and the demand of money are both, in various ways, not under government control (because private lending changes the money supply in practice). In the 19th and early 20th century, western governments chose to let inflation occur from time to time and deflation occur from time to time. The problem with this was that periodic deflation was hugely damaging to economic activity and caused banks, businesses and even farms to fail, sometimes even when they were generally productive. This was disruptive, but not in a \"creative disruption\" type culling out process of inefficient firms, just in a kind of random and uncontrolled way. The alternative was to create government agencies and banking processes that controlled inflation and prevented deflation. These institutions could still not control changes in the rate of inflation entirely given other government policies. However, by letting inflation swing between zero percent and, say, six percent instead of between negative three percent and positive three percent, they could ensure that deflation did not occur. This means that there will always be some positive inflation, because whenever deflation looms, the government threatens to (or actually does) print money.

{"original_text": "The definition of state sovereignty (\"Westphalian sovereignty\"), in the sense we understand it today, really only goes back to the Treaty of Westphalia (1648), before which the idea of \"recognition\" doesn't easily apply in a modern sense. Thus, pre-modern \"recognition\" would effectively entail the period between the Treaty of Westphalia (1648) and the end of the Second World War (1945), or approximately 300 years. So this question is really the crux of colonialism: the absence of recognition of the Other in \"international\" affairs (really better considered \"extraterritorial\" affairs during this period because there was recognized *civilized* territory and unrecognized *savage* territory that lacked borders, integrty, etc.). This was expressed through the very general, widespread practice of not respecting the territorial integrity indigenous peoples and \"First Nations\" in effectively all locations outside of Europe, for reasons which included the *lack* of civilization as defined by the civilized. Specific examples can be considered from every country outside of Europe and even those countries of Eastern Europe conquered by the USSR after the Russian Revolution (1917). Haiti might be considered a good example of a lack of recognition. Originally (after first being conquered and stolen from the native peoples of that island) called Saint-Domingue after changing hands from Spain to France, it was much as any other slave colony until the Haitian Revolution (1791\u20131804), which effectively ended with Napolean's withdrawal from the Americas (the reasons for this are complex and had much to do with his being overstretched in Europe). Haiti, however, was *not* recognized by the United States until 1862 and there are obvious political reasons for this: it was a slave colony that liberated itself and asserted independence. The lack of recognition was essentially to appease the Southern States, but this was no longer a concern by the time of the Civil War (Lincoln abolished slavery altogether 6 months after establishing relations with Haiti). Declarations of independence from foreign rulers, along with recognition as independent states by other nations, are something of an exception -- the United States is a usual example. But this example also disregards the reality that there were already in place nation-to-nation treaties between the North American \"First Nations\" and Great Britain. So what the United States effectively did was sever those treaties and illegally claim title, which was later made \"official\" in the Treaty of Paris and related treaties that involved Britain and the United States. The historically sovereign nations of the claimed territories had no say. Another interesting modern example of no recognition is Somaliland, a territory that has claimed independence since 1991 but has not been recognized internationally as being separate from Somalia. What is remarkable about that situation is that Somalia, for decades, lacked effective central governance of any kind and was widely considered a \"failed state\" -- so Somaliland, while having a government and exercising control over the territory *without* an effective competing claim from Mogadishu, *should* have received international recognition according to the rules for this.

The invasion was bloodless and led to the English Bill of Rights, which established constitutional monarchy and limited the power of the monarch. Therefore, it can be argued that the Glorious Revolution was a combination of both revolution and invasion.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "The history of the Glorious Revolution is told through the eyes of William III, the leader of the Orange Brigade, who led the invasion of England in 1688, and his son William IV, the Duke of Orange, who played a key role in the event., this article is copyrighted."}

{"original_text": "Congrats on getting your B.A. Glad to see you are able to use it to teach. First step is to form an idea about what you want to study. Ask yourself what topic or period do you love most (or are best at). Write it down, look it up online, check the different sub-topics, focuses, etc. Look back at your past papers, what you think were your best. Then check The American Historical Society website, it has a list of schools and the topics/teachers they are known for. Once you have figured out your interest and potential list of schools that have those courses/programs, then it's time to narrow down a list of potentials. Visit the webpages of schools that you are interested in. Make sure you are thorough and use google/any other search engine as much as possible to look up where certain teachers or topics are located. Once you have them all, you got to find a way to focus on what fits best. Be realistic. You don't want to shoot for the stars, but you don't want to only apply to duds or safety schools. (A good rule of thumb is to stay away from online programs so that the degree is held in higher esteem by potential employers). I recommend choosing about 3-6 schools. At least one dream and safety school, the rest based on the program, people, and location you want most. Location is important, it can tedious in small towns and strenuous in big cities. It also has an impact on your employment possibilities (not everyone gets to be an intern). Account for the social life, you will go crazy without one. Also make sure the program isn't so big you get lost in the shuffle. Most importantly, read the admission requirements carefully. What does the application require? Probably GPA scores (your college transcripts), GRE scores, recommendations, a statement of purpose (or some statement of intended research), and a writing sample. If you haven't taken the GRE test already, you will need to, and you will need to do well. The better the score, the better your chances. Honestly the sooner you take the GRE the better, so you can retake it if necessary. 3 months before application deadlines should be your last chance to schedule the test in time for it to reach the school. Now you have the option to take the test right away if you are dead set on pursuing this path, it will give you a leg up on meeting with your professors, as you have just illustrated commitment. However, I find it is always prudent to seek some professional opinion before jumping so far into the process. Once you have about 6 schools, a general topic/period/area of emphasis, and have considered the additional steps needed to pursue this, you should meet with your professors. Meet with your favorite professors/the ones who liked you the best/the class you did the best in and ask them about pursuing that path. Tell them why you want to do this, your motivations, ideas of where you want to go, what you want to study, what path you see this degree being used (i.e. tenure professor, think tank consultant, government position, Alien Guy on the History Channel, etc.). Then ask them what they think. They will give you mixed information and may temper your expectations/decision. I do not wish to be a buzz kill and do not mean to imply that these professors won't help you, but I've been told this a lot recently by senior professors at several universities, \"Unless you can't live without it, don't go for the Ph.D.\" (Some say Masters too, others do not). The field is not in the best shape right now. I've just submitted my second round of Ph.D apps and have got a lot of varying advice. They will say that Funding is down. Costs are up. The political situation is having a negative effect on public universities. Private ones are weathering the storm, but also suffering cuts. The ability for a Masters to get you a great job is not what it use to be. Most say if you are serious about being a tenure professor and teaching/researching in academia for a living then a Ph.D is required. In some areas you can still get away with teaching community colleges with just a Masters, but job security is not there anymore. Don't get discouraged. They will say that there are rays of hope. That some of the places you named sound like a great fit, that our profession is always around and is highly adaptable (as is our degree). Essentially what they say is that if you got the knack, the passion, an idea of what you'd be interested in studying, and good GPA/GRE scores, then you've made your life a lot easier in applying to schools. Then they add that it'll be easier that is in accepting the fact that you will be over-worked, under paid, and generally overlooked for the first half of your career. But again, this is just to be upfront with you. It isn't discouragement, it is just realistic observations about the state of our profession. At this point, once you have stated that you understand and love history and are set on pursuing it, then ask for a recommendation. Offer to provide stamps and envelopes (if the applications are hard copy, many do it online now...though even some of those require some hard copy of some of the submission materials) this will win some small points. They will ask to see the intended statement of purpose (or whatever your school calls it) so they can tailor their recommendation. They may also ask to see your intended writing sample. Hopefully you have an idea of the best paper you have done and have a saved copy that you can send them. The statement of purpose/whatever can be general or ask specific points. Usually it is to talk a little about yourself, your interests, potential research ideas, how your past work or experiences has gotten you to where you are (in terms of interest), and what you intend to do with your degree. Once you have it written, get it reviewed a few times. Re-write it if you have to. I find that this system is effective: first paragraph is a hook with some personal story or something that brings home your passion for history, second paragraph academic background and classes that peaked your interest in your old institution. Third is potential research topics/direction. Fourth why you chose that school. Fifth what you intend to do with it and conclusion. This of course depends on the word limit, but do what you think flows best. Do this process for every school, one size never fits all. Now send those statements to your professors while you either take your GRE or put together your application materials. Each one will cost some money, so hopefully you have planned to pay a minimum of $50 an application (not to mention the few hundred or so on the GRE). If you are doing hard copies, be thorough, make sure you include your SOP, recommendations, a standard cover letter, your CV, writing sample, transcripts, and scores (if you didn't have them sent from the GRE directly).

{"original_text": "Early Diagnosis is Important Although there is no cure for Paget's disease of bone, it is treatable. Treatment is most effective when the disease is diagnosed early, before it causes major changes in the affected bones. The goal of treatment is to relieve bone pain and prevent the disease from progressing. Medications Are Available The Food and Drug Administration has approved several medications that can stop or slow down the progression of the disease and reduce pain and other symptoms. These medications fall into two categories: bisphosphonates and calcitonin. Both medications work by stopping or reducing the excessive breakdown of old bone that leads to excessive formation of new, but weaker, bone. People with Paget's disease should talk to their doctors about which medication is right for them. Bisphosphonates Six bisphosphonates are currently available for patients with Paget's disease. Doctors most commonly recommend the strongest ones, which include risedronate alendronate pamidronate zoledronic acid tiludronate and etidronate are not as strong but may be appropriate for some patients. risedronate alendronate pamidronate zoledronic acid tiludronate and etidronate are not as strong but may be appropriate for some patients. Some of the bisphosphonates approved for the treatment of Paget's disease, including risedronate and alendronate, are also approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. However, people with Paget's disease must take higher dosages of these medicines for shorter periods of time than people with osteoporosis. Calcitonin Doctors also may prescribe calcitonin to treat Paget's disease in some people, although it has been found to be less effective than bisphosphonates. Calcitonin is a naturally occurring hormone made by the thyroid gland. Your doctor may recommend that you repeat calcitonin treatments with brief rest periods in between treatments. The nasal spray form of calcitonin is not recommended or approved to treat Paget's disease. Surgery Surgery may be a treatment option for some people. Hip or knee replacement surgery may help people with severe arthritis. Surgery can also realign affected leg bones to reduce pain or help broken bones heal in a better position. Nutrition and Exercise Good nutrition and exercise are important for bone health, and that is true for people with Paget's disease as well. Women over age 50 should consume 1,200 milligrams (mg) of calcium daily. Men between the ages of 51 and 70 should consume 1,000 mg of calcium a day, and men over 70 should consume 1,200 mg per day. People ages 51 to 70 should consume at least 600 international units (IU) of vitamin D daily. People over age 70 should consume at least 800 IUs daily. Calcium keeps bones strong, and vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium. Exercise is very important in maintaining bone health, avoiding weight gain, and keeping joints mobile. However, people with Paget's disease need to avoid putting too much stress on affected bones. They should discuss their exercise program with their doctor to make sure it is a good one for them. Finding New Treatments Recently, there have been major advances in the treatment of Paget's disease of bone. Research into new treatments continues. Some researchers are trying to identify the genetic and viral causes of the disease. Other researchers are learning more about bone biology to better understand how the body breaks down old bone and replaces it with new bone.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Early Diagnosis is Important Although there is no cure for Paget's disease of bone, it is treatable.

There were also some alleged coup attempts, like the 1975 US government's \"Plumbers\" unit, which was accused of trying to overthrow President Richard Nixon. But it's hard to know for sure if it was really a coup attempt. In other modern democracies, like India, Brazil, and South Africa, there have been some attempts at coups, but they haven't been successful.

{"original_text": "The notion of needing a \"spear unit against cavalry\" comes from video games with rock-paper-scissor mechanics and has no bearing on actual military history. Spears were by far the most common weapon used in antiquity, whether by infantry or by cavalry, and spear-armed infantry would almost always be fighting other infantry. Indeed, to some extent the entire idea of \"units\" is a war-game or video-game idea. Professional Hellenistic and (less professional) Roman armies had distinct types of infantry with specialist roles, but tribal forces and the like were organised in battle-lines with little differentiation, and even the Greek soldiers would typically be formed in a single solid phalanx. They would still have some sort of subdivisions, but these would not usually be armed with distinct types of weaponry (\"units of spearmen\") but instead be things like the retinues of individual leaders or contingents from certain tribes or regions. In most armies, particularly tribal ones, these would not be capable of independent action and manoeuvre. It was one of the demonstrations of the Roman army's skill that they could and did occasionally send cohorts to outflank enemies, launch rear attacks, or react to breakthroughs and enemy movements. But even for them this was a risky kind of ploy, and even for them it would be impossible to use any unit of infantry specifically against cavalry unless you managed to surprise them like Caesar did at Pharsalus. It should also be noted that the examples I can think of tend to involve the more professional army of the late Republic, and not the one of the middle Republic that had the spear-armed *triarii.* Before I go too far the other direction, though: spears themselves certainly *were* useful when fighting cavalry, because of their longer reach. We do have various instances, such as the battle of Pharsalus or Arrian's array against the Alans, where infantry are specifically instructed to use spears against cavalry. (Or their *pila,* in the case of Pharsalus.) It's just that there usually is no way in a battle of making sure any \"unit\" with a certain kind of weapon ends up fighting the enemy cavalry, if there even is such a thing as a unit at all. In the examples we have, the general knows they're going to face a cavalry-heavy enemy and organises his army accordingly. He isn't keeping a reserve of spearmen like the *triarii.* Nor was it a case of \"old Romans clinging to tradition\" since the *triarii* kept their spears in generation after generation, and these same men would in their youth have used the javelin and short sword just like the other soldiers in the legion. (Indeed, they did still carry swords in addition to their spears.) It was no more or less traditional to carry the heavy spear than to carry the javelin. So why did the *triarii* carry spears? Or indeed, the rest of the hoplite panoply? Our sources aren't very explicit in explaining why. We do know the tactical role of the *triarii*, though: they were the ultimate reserve, and would often cover the retreat of the rest of the army. This is probably why their equipment is different. The first two lines of heavy infantry had to attack the enemy, and so carried throwing spears to soften them up and short swords to launch aggressive close-quarter attacks. The more heavily equipped *triarii* would typically rest on one knee, or even sit down, and watch the battle progress. Usually, they would do nothing much at all. (\"Come now, everyone sit on the periphery, just like the *triarii*,\" Plautus jokes in one of his plays.) But if the battle went poorly for the Romans, and they had to retreat, the *triarii* were there to fall back on. These older, steadier men, who wouldn't panic as easily as the younger soldiers, would take up their heavy shields, form a dense phalanx, and either fight with their longer spears or plant them in the ground to make a deadly fence of spearpoints and fight with their swords, thereby presenting a very formidable obstacle to the tired enemy who thought they had already won the battle. (Indeed, on one occasion the heavy spears of the *triarii* were given to the first line of *hastati* to help them block a wild Gallic (infantry) charge.) Since the vast, vast majority of casualties in ancient battles occurred when one army broke and ran and was pursued for miles by the vengeful enemy, this practice seems very sensible in safeguarding against devastating loss. It is also plausible that the younger soldiers were much encouraged by knowing they had the *triarii* waiting at their back in case things went pear-shaped, and therefore would be much more confident in their own attacks. **Sources:** * Erdkamp, Paul, *A Companion to the Roman Army,* (2011). * Goldsworthy, Adrian, *The Complete Roman Army,* (2003).", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "The notion of needing a \"spear unit against cavalry\" comes from video games with rock-paper-scissor mechanics and has no bearing on actual military history.

The answer turns out to be pretty simple; unless you do renovation-type work as your day job, or have really good friends in the residential contracting business, sell as-is. You will virtually never get back the full price of bringing in a gen-con to renovate any space in your home; you do that when you want to spend the extra to make your home exactly what you wanted, so you can live in it for decades and get the enjoyment out of it. If you're trying to turn a profit with the renovation, like house-flippers do professionally, you look for easy repairs/renos, buy good-looking but inexpensive materials, and do the labor yourself. Whether you sell to the market or to a specifically-interested buyer is your call, but I will caution you that a specifically-interested buyer is going to be looking for a deal, or a steal. When marketing our house, we met with three different realtors. The first one was very overoptimistic about what we could list for (basically assuming that we could get the same price as a fully-upgraded version of our same floor plan with a pool out back). She also had a to-do list a mile long, and my wife and I both noticed that she looked very apprehensive about the house when looking around, even as she reassured us that selling it would be no trouble. We eventually realized why she was so apprehensive, and fired her before we got even halfway through her to-dos, which included major landscaping, new kitchen floors and countertops, etc, which would have cost us thousands and would not have gotten the house price even close to the target. The second one took a look at our half-finished refinish and told us to stop everything we were doing to update the minor stuff like paint and fixtures, saying we were putting lipstick on a pig; she would market the house to some cash buyers she knew personally, for about 80% of the list price our first realtor quoted, and implied that we should be kissing her boots for finding us a buyer willing to take the house off our hands at all. During the tour, she pointed out \"\"problems\"\" with the house that weren't even there, like foundation issues such as sloping floors, in an attempt to scare us into going with her strategy. We sniffed that out pretty quickly, showed her the door at the end of the initial consult and never called back. This, by the way, is the kind of thing you want to avoid; unless your home is really dilapidated or torn apart with unfinished major renos, it should have decent value on the market and you shouldn't have to resort to a cash buyer looking for a flip or a rental property on the cheap. Just like Goldilocks, our third choice was just right. He saw all the same comparables, toured our house, and recommended that we offer about $20k less than the fully-upgraded version (but still about $20k more than the second realtor was estimating), targeting a \"\"real\"\" buyer and not an investor or flipper, but at a price that would make the lack of upgrades more acceptable. We finished the paint and finish projects we started, brought in a weekend's worth of scheduled showings, and our house was under contract for full price within 3 days, giving us the extra $20k worth of down payment to put into our new house. In summary, I highly recommend a realtor, because the one we eventually listed with worked his butt off on the business side while we fixed up the house. However, make sure you find the right one; realtors are ultimately in business for themselves, and their ultimate interest is in getting your house sold and getting you into a new one.

Until you have that, your focus may as well be on getting there, because you can't fix much else about your finances until you fix this. A number you want to know is your percentage of income saved, and a good goal for that is about 15%, with 10-12% going to retirement savings and the rest to shorter-term goals and emergency fund and so forth.

Doing both is even better. The book Your Money or Your Life by Dominguez and Robin is good for showing how to obsessively focus on cash flow, even though you may not share their zeal for early retirement. A simpler exercise than what they recommend: take 3 months of your checking and credit card statements, go through each expenditure and put them in a spreadsheet column, SUM() that column. Then add up 3 months of after-tax paychecks. Divide both numbers by three and compare. (The 3 months is to average out your spending, which probably varies a lot by month.) After positive cash flow and savings rate, the next thing I'd go through is insurance. Risk management for what you have. This can include checking you have all the important insurance coverages (homeowner's/renter's, auto, potentially umbrella, term life, disability, and of course health insurance, are some highlights); and also adjusting all your policies to be most cost-effective, which usually means raising the deductible if you have a good emergency fund. Often you can raise the deductible on policies you have, and use the savings to add more catastrophe coverage (such as term life if you didn't have it, or boosting the liability protection on your homeowner's, or whatever).

In his analysis, settlers of various European ethnic backgrounds - or \u2018backwoodsmen\u2019 - in their violent struggle to colonize the western frontier, had forged a unique sense of American identity out of multiple ethnicities, that was defined by its emphasis on bravery and a masculine sense of muscular resilience. But because only white Americans possessed these racial traits, he held, only they could be entrusted with the responsibility of democratic participation. Thus, even a staunch Progressive like Roosevelt didn't attempt to question the ideological framework behind the racial exclusion of the South - in fact, he only reinforced the underlying ideological notion of Jim Crow that black were simply not a part of the American nation. Woodrow Wilson is best remembered for his Wilsonian perspective on foreign relations: the belief that all peoples of the world have a right to self-determination, and that colonialism, by extension, has no place in a just world. Yet, he supported segregation in the federal government, and when discussing the self-governance of Germany's former sub-Saharan colonies, he was unwilling to grant sovereignty to residents that, in the very words of the League of Nations charter, were \u201cnot yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world.\u201d Just as in the case of Roosevelt, this leaves us with a Progressive politician that was unwilling to question the fabric of racism that was so ever-present in the America before the 1960's.

{"original_text": "To answer the question in depth we first have to look at the circumstances of the charter. After William II. Rufus died on August 2nd of 1100, Henry hurried first to Winchester - to secure the royal treasure - and then to Westminster, where he was crowned king on August 5th, despite only a handful of nobles being present and both archbishops of the kingdom unavailable. This haste was necessary though because Henry's oldest brother, Robert Curthose, also had a very good claim to the throne of England, even though during this time he was still on his way back from the first crusade. So, either on the day of his coronation or a few days after (there is no consensus on this, but for this question it can be ignored) Henry issued the charter, which was largely based on the threefold coronation oath common at the time, and had it distributed in the kingdom. It's not entirely sure if the initative to the charter came from Henry himself or if Henry was pressed by the nobles, as many of the points in the charter discussed the relation between king and nobles, especially the status of heirs and widows. In any case the charter can be seen as a token to secure Henry's reign which wasn't very stable in its first years. The charter was confirmed again by Henry when his brother Robert set sail in 1101 to gain the english throne which he laid claim on. In the end Robert could be paid off by Henry and the first rough part of his reign laid behind him. So, why is this important? The monarchs following Henry simply had more support in the nobility than Henry had in his first years. Stephen, at least in the beginning of his reign in England, had the support of the nobles while Mathilda and Geoffrey of Anjou were busy in Normandy until 1144. In 1154 Henry II could wait six whole weeks between the death of Stephen and his own coronation because he didn't have to fear anyone taking the throne in the meantime. And Richard even had the support of the french king Philipp August, even though that friendship broke apart quite soon. Despite this I wouldn't say that the charter was forgotten. Stephen and Henry issued coronation charters themselves, and the charter of liberties was nothing else before it became the charter of liberties (the name was applied later on). Both of them even referenced the coronation charter of Henry I, even though their charters weren't as long as Henrys. Henry II basically wrote *I give you all the good laws that my grandfather Henry gave*. So while the contents may have been ignored or simply not enforced, a tradition of distributing the oral coronation oath in written form seems to have taken hold in England. Henry II was later on even confronted by Thomas Becket who explicitly referred to Henry II's coronation charter. The charter then got new gravitas when Stephen Langton used it as a blueprint for Magna Carta. This may have been caused by a rising interest in justice and law. J. C. Holt, Magna Carta, 3rd ed., Cambridge 2015, p. 25, writes on this: > [...] there were many copies of Henry I's Charter in circulation in the early years of the thirteenth century, and [...] they were studied intensively \u2013 which is what has always been apparent from the chroniclers, inaccurate though some of the details of their accounts have been judged to be.

{"original_text": "From what I've read on British perceptions of the American Revolution (which is admittedly far less than I've read from the American perception), it wasn't so much that the British didn't care as it was that they thought of the Revolution in terms far different from the way the colonists did. For many Americans, the Revolution was an attempt to reestablish what they believed to be a true republican system. According to them, the British system had been corrupted and a revolution was necessary to preserve the legacy of what was known as the radical Whig ideology. This ideology emphasized the importance of separations of and limitations to each branch of government's political power, educated political action by virtuous and disinterested republican citizens, and an active opposition movement. *See anything by Gordon Wood (Radicalism of the American Revolution, Creation of the American Republic), Pauline Maier (From Resistance to Revolution). There were also powerful motivations in terms of political and economic self-interest (see, for example, Woody Holton's Forced Founders) but the American rebels generally spoke in terms of ideology and at least pretended that their own self-interest was less important. For the British, the Revolution was seen in terms of strategic and imperial concerns. The colonies along the Atlantic seaboard were a relatively minor concern in the larger empire (the Caribbean sugar colonies were far more profitable and had a much more powerful lobby in Parliament - see William Ashworth's Customs and Excise). Relatively little attention was paid to the colonies that would eventually become the United States, which operated essentially independently until the taxation crises began after the Seven Years War ended in 1765. As a result, Britain had very little grasp of those colonies' belief systems or political and economic interests. So, there was a very real series of misunderstandings and miscommunications that occurred between the British and their colonial subjects leading up to the Revolution (see Lawrence Henry Gipson's The British Empire before the Revolution - it's 15 volumes, fair warning). In all likelihood British officials at the time were genuinely perplexed regarding the American's complaints. Each time a taxation crisis cropped up from 1765 (passage of the Stamp Act) until the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, the British attempted to answer American complaints with at least partial administrative reforms while maintaining its right to govern in any way it saw fit. When each attempt was met with further opposition, that confusion only grew. That coupled with the fact that the American colonists were basing their beliefs about the British political system on a political ideology (the radical Whig one) that was considered a relatively inconsequential political failure in Britain drove many in Britain to draw the conclusion that colonists' complaints were founded in something other than the ideology they claimed to uphold. Instead, it was believed that the Americans were resentful of Britain's status within the empire. So, by the time actual hostilities broke out in 1775 there was a drastic diversion between American and British perceptions over what caused the breakdown in relations between the colonies and the empire. For the Americans, it was considered an ideological struggle. For the British, it was seen as a significant challenge to its authority within the empire. Losing the Revolution would mean a significant blow to British authority both in relation to its position within the empire and in relation to its position versus other imperial powers (mainly Spain and France). So, when the colonies formally rebelled, Britain focused on the rebellion within a larger context (especially when France and Spain declared their allegiance to the new United States). The Revolution became, in essence, a world war throughout the empires of all three European powers. Despite this fact, the colonies were still a major concern in the war. After all, if Britain lost the colonies it opened the way for a resurgence of French or Spanish power in North America. So, an incredible number of British troops were sent to quell the rebellion and British leaders remained focused upon the American front throughout the war (see Andrew O'Shaughnessy's The Men Who Lost America). After the loss of the colonies, the British suffered a massive loss of faith in their role as an empire. This translated into the rise of a large number of movements devoted to reforming the movement so that it could be deemed worthy of wielding global power. The anti-slavery movement and the educational, criminal justice, and political reform movements all arose at this time essentially as a means of cleansing the empire and regaining what the British believed to be God's blessing for its future as a worldwide empire (see Christopher Leslie Brown's Moral Capital.)* *The presence of a large number of refugee former slaves from the American colonies in Britain after the Revolution also prompted many in Britain to become involved in the anti-slavery and reform movements (see Simon Schama's Rough Crossings).

Forgetfulness may be subtle at first, but the loss of memory worsens over time until it interferes with most aspects of daily living. Even in familiar settings, a person with Alzheimer disease may get lost or become confused. Routine tasks such as preparing meals, doing laundry, and performing other household chores can be challenging. Additionally, it may become difficult to recognize people and name objects.

{"original_text": "That's a whole lot of jurisprudence, biology and psychology you're digging up here. I'll try to address them separately and maybe mash up an answer. **Jurisprudence** There's a difference between punishment, deterrent, and prevention. I think most modern western legal scholars will agree that our judicial system does not dish out'punishment' (we do a lot of the time, but we don't want to see it that way). Punishment implies some sort of retribution, like harming the perpetrator is fair because they've caused harm. Western judicial systems are trying very hard to steer away from that. Deterrent is setting up consequences so people wont commit the crimes in the first place. It's an important part of preventing crime (although some people question whether it does, some studies have shown that the size of the deterrent has little effect on the average criminal). It is a necessary corollary of a justice system. Prevention is how western legal systems like to frame things like prison sentences. The point isn't to punish the person, but to prevent them from committing further offences, hence protecting the public. **Psychology** Emotions like shame, remorse, guilt are what is called secondary emotions (as opposed to primary emotions such as happiness, fear, sadness, anger). We also know that we do have some sort of'justice meter' in ourselves. For example, people who do a lot of good in one area of life likely neglects doing good in other areas. Once people feel like they've done enough good, their motivation to do more decreases. So we have a vague altruism threshold. We also feel bad about doing bad things so we feel guilty. We also get angry at other people's bad behaviour. Whether these secondary emotions come from social conditioning or is innate is another debate. Either way, we're talking about social animals so that question is irrelevant. We know that other social animals (esp mammals) have secondary emotions. They have jealousy, guilt, and shame. They certainly do have a concept of retribution, to punish those who've wronged them in the past. **Answer** Lots of social animals do seem to have a'justice system'. They punish wrong doers and sometimes do so as a group. They also have altruistic behaviours. However one thing to keep in mind is that a'justice system' is only a social construct. Anything that any social animal constructs under any rules which results from societal interactions may fit into this category. In response to your question about ants. I'd say no....

I'll try to address them separately and maybe mash up an answer. **Jurisprudence** There's a difference between punishment, deterrent, and prevention. I think most modern western legal scholars will agree that our judicial system does not dish out'punishment' (we do a lot of the time, but we don't want to see it that way). Punishment implies some sort of retribution, like harming the perpetrator is fair because they've caused harm. Western judicial systems are trying very hard to steer away from that. Deterrent is setting up consequences so people wont commit the crimes in the first place. It's an important part of preventing crime (although some people question whether it does, some studies have shown that the size of the deterrent has little effect on the average criminal). It is a necessary corollary of a justice system. Prevention is how western legal systems like to frame things like prison sentences.

Kaifeng, Luoyang, Hangzhou (back when it was called Lin'an) have all also been the capital more than once. Beijing, however, was not chosen willy nilly.

The following risk factors may increase the risk of prostate cancer: Age Family history of prostate cancer Race Hormones Vitamin E Folic acid Dairy and calcium The following protective factors may decrease the risk of prostate cancer: Folate Finasteride and Dutasteride The following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known: Selenium and vitamin E Diet Multivitamins Lycopene Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. New ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical trials. Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer. Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer. The following risk factors may increase the risk of prostate cancer: Age Prostate cancer is rare in men younger than 50 years of age. The chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older. Family history of prostate cancer A man whose father, brother, or son has had prostate cancer has a higherthanaverage risk of prostate cancer. Race Prostate cancer occurs more often in AfricanAmerican men than in white men. AfricanAmerican men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer. Hormones The prostate needs male hormones to work the way it should. The main male sex hormone is testosterone. Testosterone helps the body develop and maintain male sex characteristics. Testosterone is changed into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by an enzyme in the body. DHT is important for normal prostate growth but can also cause the prostate to get bigger and may play a part in the development of prostate cancer. Vitamin E The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) found that vitamin E taken alone increased the risk of prostate cancer. The risk continued even after the men stopped taking vitamin E. Folic acid Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. Folic acid is a manmade form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as wholegrain breads and cereals. A 10year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid. However, the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets. Dairy and calcium A diet high in dairy foods and calcium may cause a small increase in the risk of prostate cancer. The following protective factors may decrease the risk of prostate cancer: Folate Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. Folic acid is a manmade form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as wholegrain breads and cereals. A 10year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets. However, the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid. Finasteride and Dutasteride Finasteride and dutasteride are drugs used to lower the amount of male sex hormones made by the body. These drugs block the enzyme that changes testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Higher than normal levels of DHT may play a part in developing prostate cancer. Taking finasteride or dutasteride has been shown to lower the risk for prostate cancer, but it is not known if these drugs lower the risk of death from prostate cancer. The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) studied whether the drug finasteride can prevent prostate cancer in healthy men 55 years of age and older. This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men that took finasteride compared with the group of men that did not. Also, the men who took finasteride who did have prostate cancer had more aggressive tumors. The number of deaths from prostate cancer was the same in both groups. Men who took finasteride reported more side effects compared with the group of men that did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, and enlarged breasts. The Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events Trial (REDUCE) studied whether the drug dutasteride can prevent prostate cancer in men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk for the disease. This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men who took dutasteride compared with the group of men that did not. The number of less aggressive prostate cancers was lower, but the number of more aggressive prostate cancers was not. Men who took dutasteride reported more side effects than men who did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, less semen, and gynecomastia (enlarged breasts). The following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known: Selenium and vitamin E The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) studied whether taking vitamin E and selenium (a mineral) will prevent prostate cancer. The selenium and vitamin E were taken separately or together by healthy men 55 years of age and older (50 years of age and older for AfricanAmerican men). The study showed that taking selenium alone or selenium and vitamin E together did not decrease the risk of prostate cancer. Diet It is not known if decreasing fat or increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet helps decrease the risk of prostate cancer or death from prostate cancer. In the PCPT trial, certain fatty acids increased the risk of highgrade prostate cancer while others decreased the risk of highgrade prostate cancer. Multivitamins Regular use of multivitamins has not been proven to increase the risk of early or localized prostate cancer. However, a large study showed an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer among men who took multivitamins more than seven times a week. Lycopene Some studies have shown that a diet high in lycopene may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but other studies have not. It has not been proven that taking lycopene supplements decreases the risk of prostate cancer. Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.

{"original_text": "A lot of the way the Greek mercenary market worked is controversial, because sources are thin on the ground, and they rarely tell us much about disreputable characters like mercenaries. For much of their experience we rely on a single source: Xenophon's account of his own mercenary service in the army of the Persian pretender Kyros, and his retreat to Greece with the mercenary army after Kyros' death (401-399 BC). Even so, this source and others give us some idea of the typical process. Generally, if you wanted mercenaries, there were two ways to go about it. First, you could give a big bag of money to your representatives and send them off to places that supplied them. Certain areas (like Arkadia or Thrace) were known to provide men for hire, and you'd send your people to the areas that supplied the troop types you needed. Also, some port cities were known to have people passing through who might be willing to enter a paymaster's service. In the Hellenistic period, Tainaron, a harbour town on the southern end of the Peloponnese, developed into a literal mercenary market, a sort of Tortuga for hired warriors. In more civilised places your people would have to work with a city's *xenologos* - literally \"one who speaks with strangers\" - the official who managed the mercenary hiring process. The second method was to become the unofficial supporter of some local commander or other, with the understanding that the army he gathered and maintained at your expense was eventually to enter your personal service. The added advantage of this latter, more long-term approach is that your eventual mercenaries would be veterans who were already well-disposed towards you. Kyros used both methods to get his army of mercenaries together: > In the first place, he sent orders to the commanders of all the garrisons he had in the cities to enlist as many Peloponnesian soldiers of the best sort as they could. (...) > Still another army was being collected for him in the Chersonese, in the following manner: Klearchos was a Spartan exile; Kyros, making his acquaintance, came to admire him, and gave him ten thousand darics. And Klearchos, taking the gold, collected an army by means of this money. (...) > Again, Aristippos the Thessalian chanced to be a friend of Kyros, and since he was hard pressed by his political opponents at home, he came to Kyros and asked him for three months' pay for two thousand mercenaries, urging that in this way he should get the better of his opponents. And Kyros gave him six months' pay for four thousand, and requested him not to come to terms with his opponents until he had consulted with him. (...) > Furthermore, Kyros directed Proxenos the Boiotian, who was a friend of his, to come to him with as many men as he could get, saying that he wished to undertake a campaign against the Pisidians, because, as he said, they were causing trouble to his province. He also directed Sophainetos the Stymphalian and Sokrates the Achaian, who were likewise friends of his, to come with as many men as they could get. -- Xenophon, *Anabasis* 1.1.6-11 From the fact that the resulting army appears to have been prearranged into units (called *lochoi*) of about 100 men, it's been suggested that mercenaries were hired in such 100-man groups, rather than individually. However, given the disparate background of the individual men, it's likely that this was simply a matter of leaders of mercenary bands steadily snowballing a unit until it was large enough to be considered for hire by paymasters. The price of a mercenary appears to have been fixed: one daric or kyzikene for a month of service (Xenophon, *Anabasis* 1.3.21, 7.6.1). These gold coins were both worth roughly 25 Attic drachmai, or 150 obols, which meant that mercenaries earned a daily wage of about 5 obols - about the equivalent of the wage earned by a skilled worker in a Greek city-state. Commanders of *lochoi* were paid double; generals were paid four times the base amount. There doesn't appear to have been any difference in pay between different troop types. In Greek citizen armies, there was such a difference; hoplites were paid twice as much as light infantry, and cavalry were paid four times as much as hoplites. The reason for this is that hoplites were expected to have a servant with them (another mouth to feed), and the horsemen's horses eat a lot more than people do. It has therefore been suggested that the wages of mercenaries were paid *on top of* a food allowance, removing the need for horsemen to be paid more than others. On top of that, you would probably be expected to arm the men you hired. While many of them would bring whatever weapons they owned, others would have nothing, and all would benefit from receiving new weapons (and uniform equipment). Dionysios I of Syracuse is said to have gone to great lengths to secure for his various mercenaries the weapons they were used to using in their native lands, so that they would fight most effectively (Diodoros 14.41.5). The result of these standard arrangements was that mercenaries were expensive. To maintain a large number of men for a prolonged period of time was potentially ruinous; Isokrates complained at the end of Athens' long, futile war to recover Amphipolis in the mid-4th century that the Athenians had spent as much as 1,000 talents (6,000,000 drachmai) on mercenaries alone. This is why the most formidable mercenary armies of the Classical world were raised and maintained by autocratic rulers who held sway over significant domains (Kyros, Iason of Pherai, and above all Dionysios of Syracuse). Sources for the above are in a bunch of scholarly articles and primary sources, but the main modern work on this topic, which I would definitely recommend if you can get hold of it, is Matthew Trundle's *Greek Mercenaries: From the Archaic Period to Alexander* (2004).", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "A lot of the way the Greek mercenary market worked is controversial, because sources are thin on the ground, and they rarely tell us much about disreputable characters like mercenaries.

Term life insurance is generally more affordable and provides more straightforward coverage. If you do need a guaranteed death benefit, you could consider a term conversion option, which allows you to convert your term policy to a permanent policy later on.

It was essentially a popular revolt throughout Russia as a result of the conditions the lower classes found themselves in, as well as the disastrous and unpopular Russo-Japanese War. It started with what's now known as Bloody Sunday. Prior to 1905, the tsar was still popular and respected among the lower classes, who saw him as a father figure they could appeal to. Russia's problems were usually blamed on the corrupt bureaucracy. In January of 1905, Father Gapon, a priest, led a peaceful march of workers and their families to the Winter Palace to present a petition requesting a number of rights and freedoms (particularly labor rights). There was a bit of confusion and panic amongst the police, and they ended up opening fire on the people. Although the tsar wasn't in the palace at the time, he was blamed for those deaths, and this is when people really stopped seeing him as the \"little father\" who would help them, and started seeing him as the cause of the problem. There was a widespread outbreak of strikes, riots and terrorism throughout Russia in response to this. Peasants and workers alike attacked officials and landlords and their property. In May, a Constitutional Democrat called Milyukov persuaded the various liberal/revolutionary groups to join in a Union of Unions to organise an alliance of the people and called for a constituent assembly to replace the tsarist regime. In some major cities undergoing a general strike, workers formed councils known as soviets which would later become the power base of the revolutionary groups in 1917. Another key event was a mutiny aboard the Battleship Potemkin. Although it was the only mutiny of its kind, it scared the hell out of the government - they could no longer rely on their armed forces. By October the tsar managed to suppress the revolution by appeasing a number of key groups - peasants were release from mortgage repayments and liberals got an elected duma (parliament). The workers were now the only opposition to the tsar, and he brutally repressed them, destroying the soviets and arresting their leaders. Then he issued the October Manifesto, effectively making the duma powerless. An important thing to note about 1905 is that there was almost no involvement by the revolutionary groups.

The workers were now the only opposition to the tsar, and he brutally repressed them, destroying the soviets and arresting their leaders. Then he issued the October Manifesto, effectively making the duma powerless. An important thing to note about 1905 is that there was almost no involvement by the revolutionary groups. Most of the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks weren't even in Russia at the time, with the exception of Leon Trotsky. On the images, I can't help unfortunately. All I can say is they were probably made by and for the urban workers or the Social Revolutionaries/Social Democrats (don't let the name fool you, the SD's were a revolutionary group who hated the tsarist order) because they were never appeased by the tsar and they continued to hate him."}

{"original_text": "Treatments for atherosclerosis may include hearthealthy lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures or surgery. The goals of treatment include: Lowering the risk of blood clots forming Preventing atherosclerosisrelated diseases Reducing risk factors in an effort to slow or stop the buildup of plaque Relieving symptoms Widening or bypassing plaqueclogged arteries HeartHealthy Lifestyle Changes Your doctor may recommend hearthealthy lifestyle changes if you have atherosclerosis. Hearthealthy lifestyle changes include hearthealthy eating, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity and quitting smoking. HeartHealthy Eating Your doctor may recommend hearthealthy eating, which should include: Fatfree or lowfat dairy products, such as skim milk Fish high in omega3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, blackeyed peas, and lima beans Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas When following a hearthealthy diet, you should avoid eating: A lot of red meat Palm and coconut oils Sugary foods and beverages Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise: Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats. Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a hearthealthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples: 1,200 calories a day 8 grams of saturated fat a day 1,500 calories a day 10 grams of saturated fat a day 1,800 calories a day 12 grams of saturated fat a day 2,000 calories a day 13 grams of saturated fat a day 2,500 calories a day 17 grams of saturated fat a day Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are: Avocados Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils Peanut butter Salmon and trout Tofu Sodium You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use lowsodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt. The DASH eating plan is a good hearthealthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH. Alcohol Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is: 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine 1 ounces of liquor Maintaining a Healthy Weight Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a hearthealthy eating plan and keeping physically active. Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI: Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range. Between 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight. A BMI of 30.0 or higher is considered obese. A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal. Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk. For more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, visit Aim for a Healthy Weight. If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol. Managing Stress Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stressreducing activities, such as: A stress management program Meditation Physical activity Relaxation therapy Talking things out with friends or family Physical Activity Regular physical activity can lower many atherosclerosis risk factors, including LDL or bad cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL or good cholesterol, which helps prevent atherosclerosis. Everyone should try to participate in moderateintensity aerobic exercise at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week. Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. Read more about physical activity at: Physical Activity and Your Heart U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Quitting Smoking If you smoke or use tobacco, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, visit Smoking and Your Heart. Medicines Sometimes lifestyle changes alone arent enough to control your cholesterol levels. For example, you also may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have: Coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a prior stroke Diabetes High LDL cholesterol levels Doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with people who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to: Lower your blood pressure Lower your blood sugar levels Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack and stroke Prevent inflammation Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your atherosclerosis. Medical Procedures and Surgery If you have severe atherosclerosis, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure or surgery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, is a procedure thats used to open blocked or narrowed coronary (heart) arteries. PCI can improve blood flow to the heart and relieve chest pain. Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to keep it open after the procedure. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a type of surgery. In CABG, arteries or veins from other areas in your body are used to bypass or go around your narrowed coronary arteries. CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack. Bypass grafting also can be used for leg arteries. For this surgery, a healthy blood vessel is used to bypass a narrowed or blocked artery in one of the legs. The healthy blood vessel redirects blood around the blocked artery, improving blood flow to the leg. Carotid endarterectomy is a type of surgery to remove plaque buildup from the carotid arteries in the neck. This procedure restores blood flow to the brain, which can help prevent a stroke.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Treatments for atherosclerosis may include hearthealthy lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures or surgery. The goals of treatment include: Lowering the risk of blood clots forming Preventing atherosclerosisrelated diseases Reducing risk factors in an effort to slow or stop the buildup of plaque Relieving symptoms Widening or bypassing plaqueclogged arteries HeartHealthy Lifestyle Changes Your doctor may recommend hearthealthy lifestyle changes if you have atherosclerosis. Hearthealthy lifestyle changes include hearthealthy eating, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity and quitting smoking. HeartHealthy Eating Your doctor may recommend hearthealthy eating, which should include: Fatfree or lowfat dairy products, such as skim milk Fish high in omega3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, blackeyed peas, and lima beans Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas When following a hearthealthy diet, you should avoid eating: A lot of red meat Palm and coconut oils Sugary foods and beverages Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise: Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats. Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a hearthealthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples: 1,200 calories a day 8 grams of saturated fat a day 1,500 calories a day 10 grams of saturated fat a day 1,800 calories a day 12 grams of saturated fat a day 2,000 calories a day 13 grams of saturated fat a day 2,500 calories a day 17 grams of saturated fat a day Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are: Avocados Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils Peanut butter Salmon and trout Tofu Sodium You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use lowsodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt. The DASH eating plan is a good hearthealthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH. Alcohol Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is: 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine 1 ounces of liquor Maintaining a Healthy Weight Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a hearthealthy eating plan and keeping physically active. Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI: Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range. Between 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight. A BMI of 30.0 or higher is considered obese. A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal. Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.

If symptoms of dry eye persist, consult an eye care professional to get an accurate diagnosis of the condition and begin treatment to avoid permanent damage. Goal of Treatment Dry eye can be a temporary or ongoing condition, so treatments can be short term or may extend over long periods of time. The goal of treatment is to keep the eyes moist and relieve symptoms. (This short video discusses causes, symptoms, and treatments for dry eye.) Talk to your doctor to rule out other conditions that can cause dry eye, such as Sjgren's syndrome. You may need to treat these conditions. If dry eye results from taking a medication, your doctor may recommend switching to a medication that does not cause dry eye as a side effect. Types of Treatments Medication. Cyclosporine, an antiinflammatory medication, is a prescription eye drop available to treat certain kinds of dry eye. In people with certain kinds of dry eye, it may decrease damage to the cornea, increase basic tear production, and reduce symptoms of dry eye. It may take three to six months of twiceaday dosages for the medication to work. Some patients with severe dry eye may need to use corticosteroid eye drops that decrease inflammation. Nutritional Supplements. In some patients with dry eye, supplements of omega3 fatty acids (especially ones called DHA and EPA) may decrease symptoms of irritation. Talk with your eye care professional or your primary medical doctor about whether this is an option for you. Lenses. If dry eye is a result of wearing contact lens for too long, your eye care practitioner may recommend another type of lens or reducing the number of hours you wear your lenses. In the case of severe dry eye, your eye care professional may advise you not to wear contact lenses at all. Punctal plugs. Another option to increase the available tears on the eye surface is to plug the small circular openings at the inner corners of the eyelids where tears drain from the eye into the nose. Lacrimal plugs, also called punctal plugs, can be inserted painlessly by an eye care professional. These plugs are made of silicone or collagen. These plugs can be temporary or permanent. Punctal cautery. In some cases, a simple surgery called punctal cautery is recommended to permanently close the drainage holes. The procedure works similarly to installing punctal plugs, but cannot be reversed. Medication.

Try overthecounter remedies such as artificial tears, gels, gel inserts, and ointments. They offer temporary relief and can provide an important replacement of naturally produced tears. Avoid remedies containing preservatives if you need to apply them more than four times a day or preparations with chemicals that cause blood vessels to constrict. Wearing glasses or sunglasses that fit close to the face (wrap around shades) or that have side shields can help slow tear evaporation from the eye surfaces.

Allow your eyes to rest when doing activities that require you to use your eyes for long periods of time. Use lubricating eye drops while performing these tasks. If symptoms of dry eye persist, consult an eye care professional to get an accurate diagnosis of the condition and begin treatment to avoid permanent damage. Goal of Treatment Dry eye can be a temporary or ongoing condition, so treatments can be short term or may extend over long periods of time. The goal of treatment is to keep the eyes moist and relieve symptoms. (This short video discusses causes, symptoms, and treatments for dry eye.) Talk to your doctor to rule out other conditions that can cause dry eye, such as Sjgren's syndrome. You may need to treat these conditions. If dry eye results from taking a medication, your doctor may recommend switching to a medication that does not cause dry eye as a side effect. Types of Treatments Medication. Cyclosporine, an antiinflammatory medication, is a prescription eye drop available to treat certain kinds of dry eye. In people with certain kinds of dry eye, it may decrease damage to the cornea, increase basic tear production, and reduce symptoms of dry eye. It may take three to six months of twiceaday dosages for the medication to work. Some patients with severe dry eye may need to use corticosteroid eye drops that decrease inflammation. Nutritional Supplements. In some patients with dry eye, supplements of omega3 fatty acids (especially ones called DHA and EPA) may decrease symptoms of irritation. Talk with your eye care professional or your primary medical doctor about whether this is an option for you. Lenses. If dry eye is a result of wearing contact lens for too long, your eye care practitioner may recommend another type of lens or reducing the number of hours you wear your lenses. In the case of severe dry eye, your eye care professional may advise you not to wear contact lenses at all. Punctal plugs. Another option to increase the available tears on the eye surface is to plug the small circular openings at the inner corners of the eyelids where tears drain from the eye into the nose. Lacrimal plugs, also called punctal plugs, can be inserted painlessly by an eye care professional. These plugs are made of silicone or collagen. These plugs can be temporary or permanent. Punctal cautery. In some cases, a simple surgery called punctal cautery is recommended to permanently close the drainage holes. The procedure works similarly to installing punctal plugs, but cannot be reversed. Medication.

Research suggests that the likelihood of being ambidextrous is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including brain structure, handedness, and early childhood experiences. Genetically, ambidexterity may be more common in individuals who have a family history of left-handedness, as left-handedness is often associated with a more bilateral brain structure. Additionally, studies have shown that ambidextrous individuals tend to have a more symmetrical brain structure, with less dominance from one hemisphere over the other. Environmentally, early childhood experiences, such as playing with both hands or using both hands for tasks, may also play a role in the development of ambidexterity.

Almost every significant point on the battlefield traded hands multiple times and resulted in bloody casualties for both sides. Such attrition is never generally favorable for an invader at the end of a long supply tether, and doubly unfavorable for Napoleon's scheme of seeking grand and decisive battles (and therefore, victories). The best way to describe the French plan of attack that day is'hammer blows.' In short, the French effort was a series of frontal assaults on positions deeply fortified and almost all covered by local reserves. Napoleon's command at Borodino was distant, indifferent and was overall lacking any great brilliance or scope of thought. The French had run into strongly defended fieldworks erected by the Russians before - in 1807 - and the results then had been equally disappointing and inconclusive. They had the experience in 1812 to know better to mount a series of costly frontal pressure assaults; more importantly they potentially had the ground and time to mount a significant flanking manouver. Yet this is precisely what occurred. Napoleon's insistence on restricting independent thought among his Corps commanders, coupled with his essential removal from the battlefield all but guaranteed that the French would prosecute the battle stiffly. They would be unable to react quickly to potential windfalls as the battle developed, and equally delayed in reacting to Russian counterthrusts. As a general rule and hitherto, Napoleon's iron grip on the affairs of battle had created a unity of command and he had wielded effective control over his forces to ensure excellent flexibility and timing in the commitance of reserves or change of orders. With the exception of the 1809 campaign, Napoleon never held'battle conferences' in which he would deliberately subject himself to the opinions of his subordinates. He generally found it to be a waste of time - opinions offered to him were often very much unsolicited. Such was the case at Borodino, in which several of his generals, and in particular the Marshal Davout (who ironically, would be blamed for the failure at the Moskowa, to use the French name for the battle) strongly suggested that the enemy be taken in their right flank. Napoleon failed to listen, and the battle raged on in a series of blow-counter-blow until the Russians quit the field in relative good order. The sheer size of the field and the forces he had to command also greatly denied him his more traditional methods of command, during the actual invasion march, Napoleon simply could not keep in contact with all his units with the technology of the time. His force was far too large to allow for him and him alone to decide the final letter of events. The true fatal mistake however, was the failure to make good on his victory with his usual vigor. The Guard, quite a large formation in 1812 and relatively untouched, was not committed to pursuing the Russians and applying the pressure necessary to disrupt their good order.

{"original_text": "You're looking for a general answer where unfortunately we possess none. We only have the law codes for a tiny fraction of the full number of poleis in existence. Those we do have indicate that arrangements regarding crime and punishment could vary wildly. But to give you an indication, we have less than 10 complete or partial lawcodes, and there are over 1000 known Greek poleis. So, whilst I'd like to be able to talk generally about Ancient Greek law I can't. I don't have the evidence to. Athens' laws are the only body of law that we are really certain of, and even then there are blankspots particularly in the Archaic period. Sparta maybe comes close, and we have Gortyn's famous law code as well. Athens continues to be the one most frequently cited due to the depth of our knowledge. Unfortunately, this often leads people to conflate Athenian law with Greek law, and Athenian ideology with Greek ideology. I will talk about Athens a little because that one will probably give you the most depth. Athens possessed no police force. For extreme circumstances, there were mercenary Scythians who were used as bodyguards and heavies, but they were only rarely used. There is no concept of the state as separate from its citizens in Athens, because the citizens were the state. Over their lifetime, every Athenian citizen would be directly involved in the government in some way. Law and crime are a prime area of that civic responsibility, which will lead me into talking about the actual system itself. All actions had to be brought by a private citizen. There was no equivalent of the Crown Prosecution Service as in the UK. However, there were multiple courts and avenues for bringing a case against an individual. A basic distinction was made between types of action; a *dike* was resolving a private matter and a *graphe* was relating to public law. There were a few more distinctions than this, but these are the two that most often come up with. One restriction was that a *graphe* had to be brought with the intention of punishing the accused individual. There were also no lawyers. In theory, both defendant and accusor had to speak for themselves. Neither were allowed notes or anything else to read of, so a speech had to be learned off by heart. And there usually were speeches. The reason why I say in theory was because there was a cheat- *synegeroi* were'supporting speakers', brought in to talk about specialist topics. For example, you might bring in a *synegeros* to talk about sacred matters. My Greek Law tutor, Lene Rubinstein, is convinced the practice is more prevalent than it is often stated- of the cases we know, a third either mention a *synegeros* or we actually have a recorded speech from one. So one could line up several professional orators, and only have to make an introductory speech and probably something to round off the speech. So who were they speaking to? Juries. There were no judges in our sense of the word, and usually no arbiter either. Very occasionally one of the city's Archons would be sitting in on the trial, usually the Basileos Archon or'King' Archon, but they did not pass judgement. Instead, the juries were the sole meaningful audience, and we are not talking pools of 12. There were always an odd number, to prevent a hung jury. The minumum number was 201 jurors for a regular *dike*, and 501 jurors for a *graphe*. Votes were anonymous, and passed by placing one of two different kind of stones in a pot; one had a hole, the other not. The stones would be counted and the verdict pronounced. So where did these juries come from? A pool of at least 6000 jurors were selected by lot from the citizen body every single year. Given that the citizen body was only ever about 40,000 max (in terms of male Athenian citizens) that means an enormous proportion of Athenians were directly part of the justice system every year. No juror would know what case they were judging until the day; many measures were taken to make sure that jurors could not be bribed, and not knowing in advance the case they were judging was one of them. Eventually, the Athenians actually created something of a mechanism to randomly assign cases each day to make it even more last minute. The jurors were under oath, unlike people who met at the city's Assembly (which could be any male citizen who felt like turning up). However, the jurors could not be censured for any decision they made, unlike people at the Assembly. The actual procedure of a case depended on the precise nature of it. Some cases did not get beyond a certain point because the action was privately settled- Athenians above a certain age were required to serve as Arbitrators for a year, and they acted to encourage private settlements rather than have full criminal trials. If a *graphe* did come to trial, then this is roughly what would happen; first the prosecutor, then the defendant, spoke. Each had three hours to do so, timed with a water clock. This included time for their own speech, any *synegeroi* they wanted to bring in, cross-examining their counterpart, and bringing in any witnesses. After these six hours, the jury deliberated, and then voted. Having decided which one of the two legal agents was correct, one of two things could have happened; either the defendant was judged not-guilty and proceedings ended right there, or the defendant was judged guilty and then a new part of the trial began. Now there were speeches from each agent regarding what they felt an appropriate punishment would be, and after each had spoken the Jury would deliberate on which to follow. What punishments were available? Fines were common, and for capital/public crimes they could run into the thousands of drachmae. If a fine could not be paid, then usually the person was pronounced *atimia*, which was not'harmful' but was extremely serious. It meant the loss of all citizen rights, or rather the ability to actively exercise political citizen rights. They were no longer allowed to set foot in the Agora, and especially not to speak at the Assembly or serve on a jury. This could also be a punishment directly sentenced as well. The death penalty was used, but generally speaking you had to really piss of the jury or do something really bad for it to get that far- most cases were preferred to be settled with fines unless there was no choice. Now to confirm something you will have been suspecting. Athenian crimes were mostly NOT prescriptive- they had no set punishment that had to be applied. Now, some did have a set range of punishments available. And a very select few *did* possess a set punishment. But Athenian laws were also often NOT prescriptive- the crime of *asebeia* was'impiety'. What was impiety, precisely? That wasn't defined legally anywhere. Instead, it was up to the individual jury on the individual day to decide whether the defendant had been impious. And the Athenian system did not operate on the principle of legal precedent- the deliberations of Juries were deliberately not preserved. This also meant that many crimes were essentially'excuse' crimes- the principle of having laws available in order to bring someone to trial, and then to accuse them of other things. This was obviously not true for everything, for example homicide, but this applied to most of the ambigious crimes on the books. In addition, there was no obligation to stick to the crime that someone was technically being accused of. You were free to accuse the person you had brought up on not paying a fine of murdering their elderly parent (which did in fact happen in one particular trial). And you were allowed to wander off topic, and also to character assassinate. Character assassination was extremely common. Most often, verdicts came down to whomever had the strongest case. But that was as much due to the convinction and integrity of the argument simply rhetorically, rather than its actual forensic qualities in our modern sense. Evidence, whilst important, was not the major deciding factor in many trials.

But to give you an indication, we have less than 10 complete or partial lawcodes, and there are over 1000 known Greek poleis. So, whilst I'd like to be able to talk generally about Ancient Greek law I can't. I don't have the evidence to. Athens' laws are the only body of law that we are really certain of, and even then there are blankspots particularly in the Archaic period. Sparta maybe comes close, and we have Gortyn's famous law code as well. Athens continues to be the one most frequently cited due to the depth of our knowledge. Unfortunately, this often leads people to conflate Athenian law with Greek law, and Athenian ideology with Greek ideology. I will talk about Athens a little because that one will probably give you the most depth. Athens possessed no police force. For extreme circumstances, there were mercenary Scythians who were used as bodyguards and heavies, but they were only rarely used. There is no concept of the state as separate from its citizens in Athens, because the citizens were the state. Over their lifetime, every Athenian citizen would be directly involved in the government in some way. Law and crime are a prime area of that civic responsibility, which will lead me into talking about the actual system itself. All actions had to be brought by a private citizen. There was no equivalent of the Crown Prosecution Service as in the UK. However, there were multiple courts and avenues for bringing a case against an individual. A basic distinction was made between types of action; a *dike* was resolving a private matter and a *graphe* was relating to public law. There were a few more distinctions than this, but these are the two that most often come up with. One restriction was that a *graphe* had to be brought with the intention of punishing the accused individual. There were also no lawyers. In theory, both defendant and accusor had to speak for themselves. Neither were allowed notes or anything else to read of, so a speech had to be learned off by heart. And there usually were speeches. The reason why I say in theory was because there was a cheat- *synegeroi* were'supporting speakers', brought in to talk about specialist topics. For example, you might bring in a *synegeros* to talk about sacred matters. My Greek Law tutor, Lene Rubinstein, is convinced the practice is more prevalent than it is often stated- of the cases we know, a third either mention a *synegeros* or we actually have a recorded speech from one. So one could line up several professional orators, and only have to make an introductory speech and probably something to round off the speech. So who were they speaking to? Juries. There were no judges in our sense of the word, and usually no arbiter either. Very occasionally one of the city's Archons would be sitting in on the trial, usually the Basileos Archon or'King' Archon, but they did not pass judgement. Instead, the juries were the sole meaningful audience, and we are not talking pools of 12. There were always an odd number, to prevent a hung jury. The minumum number was 201 jurors for a regular *dike*, and 501 jurors for a *graphe*. Votes were anonymous, and passed by placing one of two different kind of stones in a pot; one had a hole, the other not. The stones would be counted and the verdict pronounced. So where did these juries come from? A pool of at least 6000 jurors were selected by lot from the citizen body every single year. Given that the citizen body was only ever about 40,000 max (in terms of male Athenian citizens) that means an enormous proportion of Athenians were directly part of the justice system every year. No juror would know what case they were judging until the day; many measures were taken to make sure that jurors could not be bribed, and not knowing in advance the case they were judging was one of them. Eventually, the Athenians actually created something of a mechanism to randomly assign cases each day to make it even more last minute. The jurors were under oath, unlike people who met at the city's Assembly (which could be any male citizen who felt like turning up). However, the jurors could not be censured for any decision they made, unlike people at the Assembly. The actual procedure of a case depended on the precise nature of it. Some cases did not get beyond a certain point because the action was privately settled- Athenians above a certain age were required to serve as Arbitrators for a year, and they acted to encourage private settlements rather than have full criminal trials. If a *graphe* did come to trial, then this is roughly what would happen; first the prosecutor, then the defendant, spoke. Each had three hours to do so, timed with a water clock. This included time for their own speech, any *synegeroi* they wanted to bring in, cross-examining their counterpart, and bringing in any witnesses. After these six hours, the jury deliberated, and then voted. Having decided which one of the two legal agents was correct, one of two things could have happened; either the defendant was judged not-guilty and proceedings ended right there, or the defendant was judged guilty and then a new part of the trial began. Now there were speeches from each agent regarding what they felt an appropriate punishment would be, and after each had spoken the Jury would deliberate on which to follow. What punishments were available? Fines were common, and for capital/public crimes they could run into the thousands of drachmae. If a fine could not be paid, then usually the person was pronounced *atimia*, which was not'harmful' but was extremely serious. It meant the loss of all citizen rights, or rather the ability to actively exercise political citizen rights. They were no longer allowed to set foot in the Agora, and especially not to speak at the Assembly or serve on a jury. This could also be a punishment directly sentenced as well. The death penalty was used, but generally speaking you had to really piss of the jury or do something really bad for it to get that far- most cases were preferred to be settled with fines unless there was no choice. Now to confirm something you will have been suspecting. Athenian crimes were mostly NOT prescriptive- they had no set punishment that had to be applied. Now, some did have a set range of punishments available. And a very select few *did* possess a set punishment. But Athenian laws were also often NOT prescriptive- the crime of *asebeia* was'impiety'. What was impiety, precisely? That wasn't defined legally anywhere. Instead, it was up to the individual jury on the individual day to decide whether the defendant had been impious. And the Athenian system did not operate on the principle of legal precedent- the deliberations of Juries were deliberately not preserved. This also meant that many crimes were essentially'excuse' crimes- the principle of having laws available in order to bring someone to trial, and then to accuse them of other things. This was obviously not true for everything, for example homicide, but this applied to most of the ambigious crimes on the books. In addition, there was no obligation to stick to the crime that someone was technically being accused of. You were free to accuse the person you had brought up on not paying a fine of murdering their elderly parent (which did in fact happen in one particular trial). And you were allowed to wander off topic, and also to character assassinate. Character assassination was extremely common. Most often, verdicts came down to whomever had the strongest case. But that was as much due to the convinction and integrity of the argument simply rhetorically, rather than its actual forensic qualities in our modern sense. Evidence, whilst important, was not the major deciding factor in many trials. EDIT: Corrected 1500-3000 jurors to 6000 due to faulty memory and factchecking myself."}

{"original_text": "First, why *are* we bilaterally symmetrical? Our left/right halves are mirrored, but there's a distinction between front/back and top/bottom due to how selection would favor differentiation between these. Consider an animal that moves with its belly facing the ground (a worm, a fish, a rhino, whatever). The animal kingdom is fairly unique in that animals are mobile. As such, a general animal that is seeking food will naturally have a front end that encounters food first. As the first end that encounters stuff during movement, it makes sense for sensory structures to evolve at this front (cranial, head) end, giving a rise to a distinct front/back end. In a similar fashion, the top/bottom face different selection pressures. On land, the bottom is either in contact or closer to the ground, while the top is facing the open environment. Even in water, where gravity is less of an issue, top and bottom face different selection pressures. A fish viewed from above will be against a backdrop of the ocean floor; viewed from below will be against a backdrop of clearer water lit from above. This can explain why many fish are camouflaged with dark colors on its top side, and light colors on its belly. So, while top/bottom and front/back have been differentiated, there is no reason why an animal would experience different things to its left or right. Sensory organs and limbs are thus symmetrical along this left/right plane, as asymmetry along this plane (the same direction as movement) would make locomotion difficult, or make animals less perceptive of one side of them, or some other maladaptive outcome. Internally, movement and sensory organs don't have the same selection pressure and are free to evolve in non-symmetrical ways if it's advantageous. And once just one thing becomes asymmetrical, the others have to as well, to fill the remaining space efficiently. One big player in this is the digestive system, which is essentially one long continuous tube from mouth to anus. In some animals, like worms, this really is a straight, symmetrical tube. But other animals have different nutritional requirements, and one way to increase the efficiency of absorption is increasing the length (not necessarily width) of the digestive tract. To do so, you have to start bending the tube around the body cavity in a non-symmetrical way. This initial asymmetry could have paved the way for further internal developmental asymmetries that were selected for because they made the most use out of the remaining space.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "First, why *are* we bilaterally symmetrical?

{"original_text": "Cardiogenic (kardeeohJEnik) shock is a condition in which a suddenly weakened heart isn't able to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The condition is a medical emergency and is fatal if not treated right away. The most common cause of cardiogenic shock is damage to the heart muscle from a severe heart attack. However, not everyone who has a heart attack has cardiogenic shock. In fact, on average, only about 7 percent of people who have heart attacks develop the condition. If cardiogenic shock does occur, it's very dangerous. When people die from heart attacks in hospitals, cardiogenic shock is the most common cause of death. What Is Shock? The medical term \"shock\" refers to a state in which not enough blood and oxygen reach important organs in the body, such as the brain and kidneys. Shock causes very low blood pressure and may be life threatening. Shock can have many causes. Cardiogenic shock is only one type of shock. Other types of shock include hypovolemic (hypovoLEEmik) shock and vasodilatory (VAZohDILEahtore) shock. Hypovolemic shock is a condition in which the heart cant pump enough blood to the body because of severe blood loss. In vasodilatory shock, the blood vessels suddenly relax. When the blood vessels are too relaxed, blood pressure drops and blood flow becomes very low. Without enough blood pressure, blood and oxygen dont reach the bodys organs. A bacterial infection in the bloodstream, a severe allergic reaction, or damage to the nervous system (brain and nerves) may cause vasodilatory shock. When a person is in shock (from any cause), not enough blood and oxygen are reaching the body's organs. If shock lasts more than a few minutes, the lack of oxygen starts to damage the bodys organs. If shock isn't treated quickly, it can cause permanent organ damage or death. Some of the signs and symptoms of shock include: Confusion or lack of alertness Loss of consciousness A sudden and ongoing rapid heartbeat Sweating Pale skin A weak pulse Rapid breathing Decreased or no urine output Cool hands and feet If you think that you or someone else is in shock, call 911 right away for emergency treatment. Prompt medical care can save your life and prevent or limit damage to your bodys organs. Outlook In the past, almost no one survived cardiogenic shock. Now, about half of the people who go into cardiogenic shock survive. This is because of prompt recognition of symptoms and improved treatments, such as medicines and devices.

{"original_text": "What are the signs and symptoms of Book syndrome? To our knowledge, Book syndrome has only been reported in one, large Swedish family (25 cases in 4 generations) and in one other isolated case. The signs and symptoms reported in the Swedish family included premolar aplasia (when the premolars fail to develop); excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis); and early whitening of the hair. Early whitening of the hair was the most constant symptom, being found in every affected family member. The age of onset of this symptom ranged from age 6 to age 23. In some cases, there was whitening of hair on other parts of the body such as the armipits, genital hair, and eyebrows. Twothirds of the affected people had an abnormality of the sweat glands. In the isolated case, additional features that were reported include a narrow palate (roof of the mouth); hypoplastic (underdeveloped) nails; eyebrow anomalies; a unilateral simian crease; and poorly formed dermatoglyphics (skin patterns on the hands and feet). The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Book syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Premature graying of hair 90% Short palm 90% Abnormality of the eyebrow 50% Abnormality of the fingernails 50% Abnormality of the palate 50% Single transverse palmar crease 50% Autosomal dominant inheritance Hypodontia Palmoplantar hyperhidrosis The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study.

To our knowledge, Book syndrome has only been reported in one, large Swedish family (25 cases in 4 generations) and in one other isolated case. The signs and symptoms reported in the Swedish family included premolar aplasia (when the premolars fail to develop); excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis); and early whitening of the hair. Early whitening of the hair was the most constant symptom, being found in every affected family member. The age of onset of this symptom ranged from age 6 to age 23. In some cases, there was whitening of hair on other parts of the body such as the armipits, genital hair, and eyebrows. Twothirds of the affected people had an abnormality of the sweat glands. In the isolated case, additional features that were reported include a narrow palate (roof of the mouth); hypoplastic (underdeveloped) nails; eyebrow anomalies; a unilateral simian crease; and poorly formed dermatoglyphics (skin patterns on the hands and feet). The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Book syndrome.

{"original_text": "This sounds like the sort of question that would require several lectures to answer properly. I\u2019ll do my best to simplify somewhat (but apologize in advance for any long-windedness). Your question can be broken into three parts: **I. What was the Ancien R\u00e9gime?** The Ancien R\u00e9gime (or Old Regime) is a term used to describe the social and political systems in France from roughly the 15th century to the 18th century. In politics, this means monarchy and aristocracy; in society, it means the estate system. *Politics*: The first thing you need to know about the 15th-18th centuries is that it is an era of increased centralization. Beginning under Henry IV and continuing through Louis XIV, a series of ministers worked to consolidate the administrative units of France under the rule of the king. There were several reasons for this: (1) perceived threats from other countries; (2) increased trade and transportation systems; and (3) increased court costs coupled with a need to standardize taxation. Of course, this was happening all over Europe, and in fact the map of Europe begins to resemble that of today as countries form larger administrative groups \u2013 but I digress. The centralization was thus fuelled by political and economic reasons. The king, or his chief ministers, would place first *gouverneurs* and later *intendants* in each region to maintain order and ensure that judicial power in the provinces ran from the king, rather than the local nobleman. This, naturally, did not please aristocrats, who did not particularly wish to cede all of their powers to the centralized state. Parlements remained in place that maintained some judicial and legislative control (subject to the king and the Parlement of Paris), but much of the real power of aristocrats was taken. There were many justifications for this, but the most important one is known as the *divine right of kings*. Basically, the king was chosen by God to rule over his people. To question that, or to challenge the king\u2019s authority, was to challenge God. Since nobody really wanted to challenge the power of Heaven, the king and his ministers were allowed an enormous amount of power within the state. *Society*: In order to understand the French Revolution, it is important to understand the estate system. In France during the pre-revolutionary period, there are three \u201cestates\u201d that divide the population. The First Estate is comprised of the clergy. The clergy were exempt from any taxes (they instead gave a \u2018donation\u2019 to France every year that was much lower than the taxes they would have had to pay). The Second Estate is comprised of the nobility. The nobility were exempt from most taxes and were given privileges at court. [If you\u2019re interested, they\u2019re technically divided into the \u201cnobility of the robe\u201d, who dealt with civil governance, and \u201cnobility of the sword\u201d, which is fairly self-explanatory.] The Third Estate was everyone else: non-noble bourgeoisie, urban and rural craftsmen, farmers, peasants, etc. The majority of taxes was levied on this estate, despite the fact that their income was considerably less than the first and second estates. Good so far? Excellent. **II. What were the causes of the French Revolution?** The causes of the Revolution are many, and I apologize for oversimplifying somewhat. First, the philosophes. Philosophes were public intellectuals whose life philosophy might be summed up by Kant\u2019s famous maxim \u201cSapere aude\u201d \u2013 dare to know. They fought for the democratization of knowledge, the replacement of superstition with skepticism; they championed the sciences and applied logical rigor to all subjects. The philosophes are primarily remembered for their \u201crepublic of letters\u201d (they were a literary bunch, and would spread their views through publishing) and for their consistent fight against dogma. This took the form of religion, naturally \u2013 with a few exceptions, most philosophes disavowed particular sects of Christianity in favor of Deism \u2013 but also of government. Divine right monarchy was soundly criticized as a poor reason for governance, and so the philosophes proposed an alternative system based on talent rather than birth. They were responsible for most of the criticism of the Ancien R\u00e9gime in the years leading toward the French Revolution, and their popular works did much to sway public opinion. In addition, intellectuals such as Voltaire and Diderot did much to champion the ideas of \u201cequality\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d that would become central to the Revolution. Next, the wars in America. The colonies rebelled against England in 1776. Despite having just fought the colonies for control of North America during the Seven Years\u2019 War, France sought to challenge British global dominance and supported the rebellion. This support (which included troops during the latter half of the American Revolution) was instrumental to the revolution\u2019s success, but it came at a hefty cost. To make a long story short, France ran out of money somewhere in the midst of their battle for world domination. It instituted a number of taxes on the already heavily-taxed Third Estate, who struggled to pay and still make ends meet. Indeed, famine is now considered one of the causes of the French Revolution as the peasantry rebels in an effort to survive. Ultimately, the Third Estate was unable to provide enough money to balance the books, and so the first two estates were asked to relinquish some of their traditional privileges and tax exemptions. Naturally, this was not particularly popular. To remove exemptions would be tantamount to challenging the hierarchical system itself, and with the king perched precariously at the top, it would be political suicide. Instead of simply raising the taxes, then, the king was forced to call the Estates General into session in order to comprehensively reform the country. With promises of reform coming and political pamphleteers like the Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s writing impassionedly in favor of the Third Estate, it was only a matter of time before public opinion began to turn against the ideas of hierarchy and divine right monarchy in favor of a system that placed talent above birth as a criterion for fitness to rule. **III. How does the French Revolution relate to the Ancien R\u00e9gime?** The French Revolution is the reason why the term Ancien R\u00e9gime makes sense. The phrase first appears in the eighteenth century as a way to differentiate between hierarchy/divine right and equality/liberty/republicanism. The \u201cold\u201d regime describes the state of affairs in Europe leading up to the French Revolution; the \u201cnew\u201d regime was intended as an alternative based on reason. Tradition versus talent, birth versus brains: this is the way that the pre- and post-Revolutionary worlds are separated. I suppose that the answer to this final question is that it is the perceived abuses of the Ancien R\u00e9gime that cause the French Revolution; and the Revolution that marks the downfall of the Ancien R\u00e9gime. Each is crucial for understanding the other. Again, this is just meant as a short overview. For futher reading, William Doyle, T.C.W. Blanning, Peter McPhee, Keith M. Baker, Albert Soboul, Lynn Hunt, Hillaire Belloc\u2026 everyone has their own interpretation. For historical fun, check out de Tocqueville\u2019s *L\u2019Ancien R\u00e9gime et la R\u00e9volution*.

This support (which included troops during the latter half of the American Revolution) was instrumental to the revolution\u2019s success, but it came at a hefty cost. To make a long story short, France ran out of money somewhere in the midst of their battle for world domination. It instituted a number of taxes on the already heavily-taxed Third Estate, who struggled to pay and still make ends meet. Indeed, famine is now considered one of the causes of the French Revolution as the peasantry rebels in an effort to survive. Ultimately, the Third Estate was unable to provide enough money to balance the books, and so the first two estates were asked to relinquish some of their traditional privileges and tax exemptions. Naturally, this was not particularly popular. To remove exemptions would be tantamount to challenging the hierarchical system itself, and with the king perched precariously at the top, it would be political suicide. Instead of simply raising the taxes, then, the king was forced to call the Estates General into session in order to comprehensively reform the country. With promises of reform coming and political pamphleteers like the Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s writing impassionedly in favor of the Third Estate, it was only a matter of time before public opinion began to turn against the ideas of hierarchy and divine right monarchy in favor of a system that placed talent above birth as a criterion for fitness to rule. **III. How does the French Revolution relate to the Ancien R\u00e9gime?** The French Revolution is the reason why the term Ancien R\u00e9gime makes sense. The phrase first appears in the eighteenth century as a way to differentiate between hierarchy/divine right and equality/liberty/republicanism. The \u201cold\u201d regime describes the state of affairs in Europe leading up to the French Revolution; the \u201cnew\u201d regime was intended as an alternative based on reason. Tradition versus talent, birth versus brains: this is the way that the pre- and post-Revolutionary worlds are separated. I suppose that the answer to this final question is that it is the perceived abuses of the Ancien R\u00e9gime that cause the French Revolution; and the Revolution that marks the downfall of the Ancien R\u00e9gime. Each is crucial for understanding the other. Again, this is just meant as a short overview. For futher reading, William Doyle, T.C.W. Blanning, Peter McPhee, Keith M. Baker, Albert Soboul, Lynn Hunt, Hillaire Belloc\u2026 everyone has their own interpretation. For historical fun, check out de Tocqueville\u2019s *L\u2019Ancien R\u00e9gime et la R\u00e9volution*. I hope this helps! If anyone has something that I\u2019ve missed or if I\u2019ve made a logical leap somewhere, please let me know."}

Which is to say that his account has historic value for his personal observations of Nazi Germany and his interactions with important political figures and ordinary Germans, but a lot of care needs to be given to contextualize his observations and care needs to be given to his biases and opinions. Which is to say, Shirer is almost invariably quoted by historians of World War II and Nazi Germany (two who come to mind are Richard Evans and Stephen Kotkin), but *Shirer is used as just one of very many primary sources* in these histories.

Even if you start getting into primary sources from the period, Shirer isn't *bad*, but reading something like Victor Klemperer's published diary is probably more useful and more interesting.

None are full histories, let alone scholarly histories.

The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."}

{"original_text": "When an bunch of electrons pass through an alternating magnetic field the electrons in it will start to vibrate (wiggle) because of lorentz forces acting on charges moving in a magnetic field. Whenever an electric charge is accelerated, as they are when they wiggle back and fourth, light particles are emitted. In this case this is in the x-ray spectrum. Now the crucial part is that because the speed of light is independent of the motion of its source (by Einstein's theory) the light will be moving as compared to the electron bunch (as seen from the electron's rest frame). Thus even though the electrons are moving extremely close to the speed of light, each electron in the pulse can interact with the light emitted from the other electrons. Under the right conditions (the right electron energy, accelerator length, magnetic field strength and so on) this effect can be used to make the electrons wiggle in synch, causing the light pulses emitted by the electron bunch to interfere constructively. The result is a coherent light source not too different from a laser, operating in the x-ray region of the spectrum. Unfortunately it's very difficult to make good mirrors for high frequency x-rays, and thus the amount of lasing this type of device can achieve is limited by the practical length of the accelerator. In lasers for which practical mirrors can be made the light can be made to bounce back and fourth, being amplified on every pass, and this allows a powerful laser to be relatively compact. The difficulty of making such mirrors for high energy x-rays makes this infeasible, and hence the LCLS scheme, which utilises a long sequence of magnets, is used instead.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "When an bunch of electrons pass through an alternating magnetic field the electrons in it will start to vibrate (wiggle) because of lorentz forces acting on charges moving in a magnetic field.

This allows you to access your nest egg to pay for unforeseen expenses, without having to actually cash it out and pay the 10% penalty plus taxes. You can get up to half of your current savings, with an absolute cap of $50k, minus the balance of any other loan outstanding. While there is a balance outstanding, you must make regular scheduled payments. The agreement does include an interest rate, but basically that interest money goes into your account. The downside of a 401(k) loan is the inflexibility; you must pay the scheduled amount, and you also have to keep the job for which you're paying into the 401(k); if you quit or are fired, the balance of the loan must usually be paid in 60 days, or else the financial institution will consider the unpaid balance a \"withdrawal\" and notify the IRS to that effect. Now, with a Roth account, it works a little differently. Basically, contributions to any Roth account (IRA or 401(k)) are post-tax. But, that means the money's now yours; there is no penalty or additional taxes levied on any amount you cash out. So, a loan basically just provides structure; you withdraw, then pay back under structured terms.

{"original_text": "There are many models that seek to plot the factors that contribute to the rise and fall of empires, but perhaps the best-known at present is the one set out by the British historian Paul Kennedy in his *The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers* (1987). Kennedy's book does not cover the Roman empire, but does consider the British, Habsburg, Russian and German ones, among others. Famously, it also contains a predictive chapter analysing the position of the US as a great power and attempting to predict its likely future. This not only helped the book to become a best-seller, but impacted on US policy-making, in the 1990s in particular. At heart, *The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers* aims to explain what makes a state a \u201cgreat power.\u201d Kennedy's core thesis is that this status is conferred by relative superiority in economic production, and is most threatened by diversion of resources - essentially, by investing in a military machine that can only be \"productive\" in wartime, and often not even then, states risk squandering resources and allowing rivals to catch and surpass them. Kennedy suggests that the most common cause of an empire's \"fall\" is what he calls \"imperial overstretch\". This is caused by a state acquiring too many commitments, especially ones that involve protecting a far-flung empire, which are not justified in terms of the productive capacity of the imperial possessions that have to be protected. (I can't go into this next point in depth owing to AH's \"20 year rule\", but it's certainly arguable that the US commitment of billions of dollars to economically unproductive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past couple of decades might be a match for this part of the Kennedy model.) Kennedy starts by saying that we may define the term \"great power\" in two ways. The simple definition holds that a great power is a state that can reasonably hope to defeat any other one power in combat; the more social definition holds that a great power is a state that other states recognise as a great power. So the status of \u201cgreat power\u201d remains more a matter of mutual recognition than the passing of some arbitrary threshold. The \u201cgreat powers\u201d Kennedy concerns himself with are, initially, dynasties centered on Spain, France, and Austria. Later in the book, he examines new entrants to the \u201cGreat Power Club\u201d\u2014including Russia, Great Britain, and Germany, among others. For Kennedy, \u201call of the major shifts in the world\u2019s military-power balances\u201d\u2014meaning the relative strength of sovereign states\u2014\u201chave followed alterations in the productive balances.\u201d While his conclusion appears to be that victory follows wealth, it is not so simple; great powers make mistakes, even if they have significant resources. More often than not, then, great power conflicts can be prolonged and bloody, even if victory usually goes to the more prosperous of the two powers in conflict. The first \u201crise and fall\u201d Kennedy discusses is that of the Habsburg Empire, whose story unfolds between 1516 and 1689. In 1516, the Habsburg dynasty celebrated the coronation of Charles as Carlos I, King of Spain. But through his ancestors, he was also Charles V, ruler of the Holy Roman Empire\u2014a political body that encompassed large parts of Austria, the Netherlands, Naples, and other territories around Europe. This \u201cempire\u201d was not a centralised authority like a state; it remained an association of distant provinces ruled by a single family. Looking at why the Habsburgs failed, Kennedy argues that despite the enormous wealth from their holdings in Europe and the New World (Spain\u2019s territories in South America), the Habsburgs could not afford to fight wars on many fronts over 140 years. They built their own warships rather than use trade ships, they maintained internal and external trade barriers, and they expelled Jews from their territories. In short, the Habsburgs failed \u201cto recognize the importance of preserving the economic underpinnings of a powerful military machine.\u201d This revealed to Kennedy an important lesson: \u201cthe manufacturer and the farmer were as important as the cavalry officer and the pikeman.\u201d A state must maintain enough productive capacity to fund its military commitments. A great power fell, then, as a consequence of neglecting financial matters. In its wake, five great powers arose: Great Britain, the remains of the Habsburg Empire (Austria-Hungary), Prussia (a territory today incorporated into northern Germany), France, and Russia mounted the stage. Kennedy points to the \u201cmilitary revolution\u201d of the time, as European states equipped, paid, and directed large, professional standing volunteer armies in Europe. Geography and finance, Kennedy writes, are factors of comparable importance. Maintaining a professional army in peacetime required the state to borrow from financial markets. And great powers had to consider all the possible geographic fronts from which an invader could launch an attack. Given these circumstances, states that raised extensive funds to become \u201cgreat powers\u201d and fight one another fanned the flames of their own growth, pumping money into their own industries to house, equip, and train their military. The historian John Brewer calls this phenomenon the \u201cfiscal-military state\u201d and notes its characteristics as \u201chigh taxes, a growing and well-organized civil administration, a standing army, and the determination to act as a major \u2026 power.\u201d In essence, the strongest fiscal position supports the strongest military position. As Kennedy puts it, no battlefield blunder was \u201cenough to cancel out the advantages which that [combatant] possessed in terms of trained manpower, supply, organization, and economic base.\u201d This logic pervades Kennedy\u2019s exploration of history. As he points out in his assessment of World War I, the victorious powers enjoyed \u201ca marked superiority in productive forces\u201d after the United States joined the war in 1917. This \u201cmarked superiority,\u201d however, does not only reflect the quantity of available resources; it also reflects how those resources get deployed. Kennedy discusses Germany\u2019s Hindenburg Programme, a program intended to double the production of munitions. Germany made a \u201cmassive infrastructural investment\u201d in new industrial resources such as blast furnaces for gun-making. But accomplishing this required the country to redirect all of its skilled labor, and to allow its other industrial and agricultural output to succumb to chronic neglect. In the end, Germany\u2019s loss stemmed as much from neglecting its economic diversity as it did from any external military force. Similarly, Kennedy\u2019s account of the end of World War II shows that the \u201cmiddle powers\u201d (Britain, France, Germany) exhausted themselves, both by maintaining far-flung empires and by engaging in a grinding total war against one another. They followed this well-worn path to decline, leaving the Americans and the Russians as the world\u2019s two dominant opposing powers. In addition to exploring the roots and dynamics of the multipolar international system in Europe (a system in which many nations were competing for supremacy), Kennedy discusses how these dynamics resulted in the emergence of the bipolar international system between 1945 and 1991. But Kennedy remains most interested in discussing how the US\u2014in its Cold War bipolar contest with Russia from 1945 to 1991 and after\u2014may follow old patterns and find itself in decline. The end of World War II in 1945 left the Soviet Union and the United States facing one another in Europe. Stalin consolidated control over Eastern Europe. He also pushed his armies into Central Asia, while \u201cmaintaining a high level of military security \u2026 to deter future aggressors\u201d and keep its future conquests from falling into the American sphere of influence. In contrast, the United States attempted to create and maintain what it called a global \u201cPax Americana.\u201d Although the term refers to peace and prosperity under American rule, it disguises a great deal of internal violence in developing countries of the southern hemisphere. Kennedy believes the term references the \u201cPax Britannica\u201d of the late nineteenth century, a time of relative stability when Britain\u2019s \u201cproductive power and world influence\u201d were predominant. But two things made this twentieth-century global contest between great powers fundamentally different from its predecessors: the role of ideology and nuclear weapons. Both blocs remained committed to their respective ideologies. In earlier eras, states would fight on a religious basis, or for abstract \u201cnational interests.\u201d But the Cold War antagonists genuinely saw international affairs as a global struggle between good and evil. And unlike previous great power standoffs, the entire world had a stake in the outcome of this one as the great powers had amassed arsenals of nuclear weapons. Both the United States and Soviet Union had the means to eradicate all life on Earth at the push of a button. Grand rhetoric\u2014language intended to persuade or inflame\u2014surrounded the Cold War. But Kennedy\u2019s analysis of the conflict rests on the same logic as his analyses of previous great power struggles. It comes down to industry and economy rather than military. In the course of the Cold War, it became clear that the USSR\u2019s military and nuclear prowess \u201cwas not matched by parallel achievements at the economic level,\u201d especially in terms of technological innovation.

{"original_text": "I just finished S1E03, *The Battle of Midway*, as I've been studying that particular fight for some 35 years. The episode is perfectly accurate for the mid-90s thinking regarding the battle, which is to say, not considered accurate now. As more historians learned Japanese and were able to study primary sources in the language, more and more we discovered that much of what we thought we knew about Midway was wrong. It *does* get the broad facts correct, and really, the first seventy or eighty minutes are really quite good. There's quite a bit wrong about the events of June 4th, though, even before the modern view of the battle took hold. For example, the show kept saying that the second strike on Midway was ready to go when the first strike was returning from the island, and was held to allow the planes to land. This is wrong; the planes were still rearming when the Japanese received information about the US carriers. Then they started to rearm the planes for anti-ship work; this was never completed, even after the landing of the first strike. On the whole, however, the episode isn't \"point-at-and-laugh\" incorrect about anything, given what was known at the time. It gets some timing incorrect, but again, nothing earth-shattering. It's above-average in quality for a TV show on the battle, perhaps the best I've seen on Midway. It can't help not knowing what wasn't known by US historians of the time.

{"original_text": "The traditional thinking is that plaques are usually composites of cholesterol and white blood cells.

As far as I know, there are currently no clinically accepted methods to remove plaque from the coronary arteries by means of a procedure. If a plaque forms and causes significant narrowing of the coronary arteries, the most common procedure is called *percutaneous coronary intervention*, or PCI for short. This is done by a cardiologist who will thread a little wire from a periphery artery and navigate it until it reaches the plaque in the coronary artery. Then, the tip of the wire can inflate a balloon or deploy a stent. If the balloon is chosen, inflating it will push the plaque to the side, and try to widen the narrowing it originally caused. If a stent is chosen, it is a basically a little hollow cylinder that is placed over the plaque to keep the walls of the arteries from closing in.

{"original_text": "Great question! During the third century A.D., Roman military organization undergoes several changes, the reasons for this are unclear due to a paucity of sources. I am therefore going to backdate my answer to the second century A.D., although do note most of these arrangements likely persisted throughout the early and mid third century. During the Principate, the commander of an auxiliary unit was known as a *praefectus*, or prefect. Prefects were members of the Equestrian class, the \u201clower\u201d(relatively speaking) tier of the Roman imperial elite. Equestrians who wished to serve in the army followed a specific career path of a succession of auxiliary commands, known as the *militia equestris*. Following the reign of Claudius, this consisted of a prefecture of a cohort, legionary tribunate, and prefecture of an *ala*. Although prestige doubtless played a role in this arrangement, increasing levels of responsibility was likely more important. It required more competence to command a cavalry *ala* than to be one of several legionary tribunes. Promotion along this career path was not a given- patronage and personal or familial influence mattered in securing advancement, especially in an environment of limited posts. It is estimated that only about two-thirds of cohort prefects during the second century A.D. would have progressed to a legionary tribunate, with only half of those men advancing to the prefectship of an *ala*. Even fewer would have commanded larger auxiliary units (which I\u2019ll discuss in a second), or gone on to hold junior administrative posts. The further one advanced, the more imperial patronage and perceived loyalty mattered. Auxiliary units during the Principate were classified by several different titles. The \u201cbasic\u201d infantry unit was the *cohortes quingenariae peditatae*, organized like a legionary cohort. It thus had six centuries of (supposedly) eighty men. This gives a paper-strength of around 480 men, though actual strength varied. From the reign of Tiberius, mixed auxiliary units began to be created. *Cohortes equitatae* consisted of four *turmae* (sections or \u201ccompanies\u201d) of thirty to thirty-two cavalrymen, along with six centuries of infantry. *Equitatae* units were popular, with about 130-135 in existence during the second century, similar to the number of *cohortes quingenariae peditatae*. Both types of units were generally commanded by Equestrians beginning their military careers. From the time of Nero, larger infantry units (known as *cohortes milliariae peditatae*) are known. These units had ten centuries, rather than six, with a total paper-strength of around 800 men. Larger mixed units, known as *cohortes milliariae equitatae*, contained twelve cavalry *turmae* in addition to the six infantry centuries (for a total of around 1,056 men). These *peditatae* and *equitatae* units were distinguished by the title of their commander- *tribunus* (tribune) rather than *praefectus*. These were commanded by men as an alternative to serving as a legionary tribune. *Alae quingenariae* were purely cavalry units, with 512 men divided into sixteen *turmae*. More prestigious than infantry or mixed units, they were commanded by *praefecti* in what was likely a final military command. As there were only around ninety such units in the entirety of the army, competition was fierce. If an Equestrian officer had progressed this far, he would likely be able to pursue a procuratorship (governor of a junior province) before ending what was by all accounts a successful public career. Only about eight or nine larger cavalry units existed during the second century. Bearing the title *alae milliariae*, they were comprised of twenty-four *turmae*, with a strength of 768 men. It is clear these were regarded as elite and highly prestigious units, with command going to a prefect holding an exceptional fourth position in his military career. Such commands were not given lightly- they were awarded to only the most highly-viewed officers. These men likely went on to hold the most senior Equestrian posts. So, to summarize: Auxiliary officers were Equestrians, who followed a standardized career path. The number of commands was limited; most officers did not complete the full path of service. Auxiliary units were distinguished by their titles.

{"original_text": "As a general rule of thumb, I'd recommend that young, lower-mid class investors allocate no more than 20-30% of their portfolio to individual stocks. This is because individual stocks can be volatile and may not provide the stability and diversification that's essential for long-term wealth creation. A more balanced approach would be to focus on index funds or ETFs that track the overall market, such as the S&P 500 or Total Stock Market.

{"original_text": "Polycythemia vera (PV) doesn't have a cure. However, treatments can help control the disease and its complications. PV is treated with procedures, medicines, and other methods. You may need one or more treatments to manage the disease. Goals of Treatment The goals of treating PV are to control symptoms and reduce the risk of complications, especially heart attack and stroke. To do this, PV treatments reduce the number of red blood cells and the level of hemoglobin (an ironrich protein) in the blood. This brings the thickness of your blood closer to normal. Blood with normal thickness flows better through the blood vessels. This reduces the chance that blood clots will form and cause a heart attack or stroke. Blood with normal thickness also ensures that your body gets enough oxygen. This can help reduce some of the signs and symptoms of PV, such as headaches, vision problems, and itching. Studies show that treating PV greatly improves your chances of living longer. The goal of treating secondary polycythemia is to control its underlying cause, if possible. For example, if the cause is carbon monoxide exposure, the goal is to find the source of the carbon monoxide and fix or remove it. Treatments To Lower Red Blood Cell Levels Phlebotomy Phlebotomy (fleBOTome) is a procedure that removes some blood from your body. For this procedure, a needle is inserted into one of your veins. Blood from the vein flows through an airtight tube into a sterile container or bag. The process is similar to the process of donating blood. Phlebotomy reduces your red blood cell count and starts to bring your blood thickness closer to normal. Typically, a pint (1 unit) of blood is removed each week until your hematocrit level approaches normal. (Hematocrit is the measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood.) You may need to have phlebotomy done every few months. Medicines Your doctor may prescribe medicines to keep your bone marrow from making too many red blood cells. Examples of these medicines include hydroxyurea and interferonalpha. Hydroxyurea is a medicine generally used to treat cancer. This medicine can reduce the number of red blood cells and platelets in your blood. As a result, this medicine helps improve your blood flow and bring the thickness of your blood closer to normal. Interferonalpha is a substance that your body normally makes. It also can be used to treat PV. Interferonalpha can prompt your immune system to fight overactive bone marrow cells. This helps lower your red blood cell count and keep your blood flow and blood thickness closer to normal. Radiation Treatment Radiation treatment can help suppress overactive bone marrow cells. This helps lower your red blood cell count and keep your blood flow and blood thickness closer to normal. However, radiation treatment can raise your risk of leukemia (blood cancer) and other blood diseases. Treatments for Symptoms Aspirin can relieve bone pain and burning feelings in your hands or feet that you may have as a result of PV. Aspirin also thins your blood, so it reduces the risk of blood clots. Aspirin can have side effects, including bleeding in the stomach and intestines. For this reason, take aspirin only as your doctor recommends. If your PV causes itching, your doctor may prescribe medicines to ease the discomfort. Your doctor also may prescribe ultraviolet light treatment to help relieve your itching. Other ways to reduce itching include: Avoiding hot baths. Cooler water can limit irritation to your skin. Gently patting yourself dry after bathing. Vigorous rubbing with a towel can irritate your skin. Taking starch baths. Add half a box of starch to a tub of lukewarm water. This can help soothe your skin. Experimental Treatments Researchers are studying other treatments for PV. An experimental treatment for itching involves taking low doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This type of medicine is used to treat depression. In clinical trials, SSRIs reduced itching in people who had PV. Imatinib mesylate is a medicine that's approved for treating leukemia. In clinical trials, this medicine helped reduce the need for phlebotomy in people who had PV. This medicine also helped reduce the size of enlarged spleens.

{"original_text": "Bioelectrogenesis is completely possible, in fact, as you point out, it occurs already. In fact, all of your cells have an electrical potential between in side of the cell and the outside of the cell, of around 30 to 70 mV (the inside being negative relative to the outside). Very roughly, this is about 1/10th of the voltage of an AA battery. However, what is exceptionally important for you to understand is that biological membranes, i.e. the things that make up the walls of cells, cannot withstand large voltages (or more to the point large electric fields), because they are so very thin. Lets call the voltage across the membrane 100 mV for simplicity, and lets say the membrane in 10 nm across. Hence the electric field strength across the membrane is 10 kV/mm which is quite a lot. To put this in perspective, the electric field strength that causes electric break down of air is around 3 kV/mm, i.e. the electric field that exists across your membranes is strong enough to cause a spark in air. At this point, you MIGHT be thinking that this looks good for your story, but the opposite is true. While there is a large electric field across a cells membrane, the electric field is equal and opposite on the other side of the cell, i.e. there is essentially no electric field between the say the left side of the cell and the right side of the cell. The other thing is that this electric field strength, while high, is only high over a very short distance. i.e. in order to get an electric spark to exist over, say, 1 m of distance (i.e. a yard) then you need 3kV/mm * 1 m = 3000 volts, between two points 1 meter apart. So you would need to charge your entire body to 3000 volts relative to the target. Which reveals another problem with shooting thunder bolts. If you were to somehow charge up your body to 3000 volts, the electric field would drive that charge to the nearest place, not to some \"target\". e.g. Once you reached 1000 volts, the spark would from between your toes and the ground. Now, I suppose you could have your character deliver electric charge between one hand and the other (which it appears is what electric eels do..... between their head and their tail, and they try to contort to keep their target in the areas of highest electric field strength, i.e. they bring their head and tail close together like a pincer, and keep the target in that gap). But you're still left with the biological problem of how you character would create large extracellular voltages that brings one hand positive and one hand negative. You might say well how does the electric eel do it, and as far as I am concerned we don't have a good model of how this is achieved.

So you would need to charge your entire body to 3000 volts relative to the target. Which reveals another problem with shooting thunder bolts. If you were to somehow charge up your body to 3000 volts, the electric field would drive that charge to the nearest place, not to some \"target\". e.g. Once you reached 1000 volts, the spark would from between your toes and the ground. Now, I suppose you could have your character deliver electric charge between one hand and the other (which it appears is what electric eels do..... between their head and their tail, and they try to contort to keep their target in the areas of highest electric field strength, i.e. they bring their head and tail close together like a pincer, and keep the target in that gap). But you're still left with the biological problem of how you character would create large extracellular voltages that brings one hand positive and one hand negative. You might say well how does the electric eel do it, and as far as I am concerned we don't have a good model of how this is achieved. Despite the fact that text books tell you we know, I have never seen a explanation of how they do it that makes physical sense."}

{"original_text": "Well, they certainly did, to put it very simply. There were a series of seven major wars between European coalitions and France between 1792 and 1815, during which *millions* died, and the old order of Europe was permanently eradicated. France decisively won the first five of these wars, and in doing so, conquered most of Europe. It was not until 1814 that France (i.e. Napoleon) was defeated, but even after what was supposed to be that final defeat, Napoleon returned to power the very next year. His renewed reign lasted only around a hundred days, but it took another brief war to remove him from power again (still a significant war, with \\~60k killed in a few months). At the end of these \"Coalition Wars\", the French Monarchy was simply restored by the European powers. So, looking at the biggest possible picture, the European powers did intervene, and kept intervening until the bitter end, when they restored the monarchy. & #x200B; But, if you're wondering why they didn't intervene *initially*, to stop the French monarchy from being overthrown to begin with, it's a bit more complex. For background, Europe had been fairly stable since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which established a new European order, ending more than a century of incomprehensibly devastating religious warfare that killed millions. By the time of the French revolution, this relative peace and stability was preserved by an alliance of three dominant European powers: France, Spain and Austria. Spain possessed a massive empire, including much of Italy, and was ruled by the Bourbon family of France, its kings direct descendents of Louis XIV. Austria possessed the Holy Roman Empire, and although it wasn't actually a centralized state that could be controlled, the Habsburg rulers possessed a massive informal empire in their own right. Marie Antoinette was actually the *sister* of the Austrian Emperor. So, when the revolution threatened the French monarchy, they had three significant reasons to intervene. First, it threatened the longstanding European order. Second, it threatened their own power, as they feared revolution would spread to their own lands. Third, it quite straightforwardly threatened their own family members! & #x200B; To understand why they didn't intervene before it was too late, one must understand that the French revolution was not a straightforward overthrowing of the monarchy by the people. There was no civil war to join in on. It was instead a gradual process of political changes, brought about by economic and popular unrest, and initially, the monarchy was not threatened. France was in a major economic crisis, and the government attempted to reform the tax system to remove tax exemptions from the nobility. Regional \"parlements\", which were courts responsible for recording new laws, basically abused their position to veto these reforms, to protect the privileges of the nobility. The king therefore reconvened the archaic \"Estates General\", a general assembly equally representing the clergy, the nobility, and the people, in order to bypass the parlements. This was ineffective, as the nobility continued to stonewall the reforms. So, the estate representing the commoners reformed as the \"National Assembly\". The Assembly refused to be desolved, and, the storming of the Bastille forced the king to accept these developments, and the National Assembly became a governing body and quickly abolished the feudal nobility, the privileges of the church, and began drafting a constitution.

Let me know if you have any additional questions!", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Well, they certainly did, to put it very simply. There were a series of seven major wars between European coalitions and France between 1792 and 1815, during which *millions* died, and the old order of Europe was permanently eradicated. France decisively won the first five of these wars, and in doing so, conquered most of Europe. It was not until 1814 that France (i.e. Napoleon) was defeated, but even after what was supposed to be that final defeat, Napoleon returned to power the very next year. His renewed reign lasted only around a hundred days, but it took another brief war to remove him from power again (still a significant war, with \\~60k killed in a few months). At the end of these \"Coalition Wars\", the French Monarchy was simply restored by the European powers. So, looking at the biggest possible picture, the European powers did intervene, and kept intervening until the bitter end, when they restored the monarchy. & #x200B; But, if you're wondering why they didn't intervene *initially*, to stop the French monarchy from being overthrown to begin with, it's a bit more complex. For background, Europe had been fairly stable since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which established a new European order, ending more than a century of incomprehensibly devastating religious warfare that killed millions. By the time of the French revolution, this relative peace and stability was preserved by an alliance of three dominant European powers: France, Spain and Austria. Spain possessed a massive empire, including much of Italy, and was ruled by the Bourbon family of France, its kings direct descendents of Louis XIV. Austria possessed the Holy Roman Empire, and although it wasn't actually a centralized state that could be controlled, the Habsburg rulers possessed a massive informal empire in their own right. Marie Antoinette was actually the *sister* of the Austrian Emperor. So, when the revolution threatened the French monarchy, they had three significant reasons to intervene. First, it threatened the longstanding European order. Second, it threatened their own power, as they feared revolution would spread to their own lands. Third, it quite straightforwardly threatened their own family members! & #x200B; To understand why they didn't intervene before it was too late, one must understand that the French revolution was not a straightforward overthrowing of the monarchy by the people. There was no civil war to join in on. It was instead a gradual process of political changes, brought about by economic and popular unrest, and initially, the monarchy was not threatened. France was in a major economic crisis, and the government attempted to reform the tax system to remove tax exemptions from the nobility. Regional \"parlements\", which were courts responsible for recording new laws, basically abused their position to veto these reforms, to protect the privileges of the nobility. The king therefore reconvened the archaic \"Estates General\", a general assembly equally representing the clergy, the nobility, and the people, in order to bypass the parlements. This was ineffective, as the nobility continued to stonewall the reforms. So, the estate representing the commoners reformed as the \"National Assembly\". The Assembly refused to be desolved, and, the storming of the Bastille forced the king to accept these developments, and the National Assembly became a governing body and quickly abolished the feudal nobility, the privileges of the church, and began drafting a constitution. All of this, amazingly, took place in 1789, during the very initial stages of the revolution. Even after the king infamously tried to flee from Paris to launch a counter-revolution, he was still kept on the throne under a new constitution. & #x200B; The revolutionary takeover was gradual, thus, so was the alarm from European powers.

{"original_text": "Peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) is diagnosed based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. P.A.D. often is diagnosed after symptoms are reported. A correct diagnosis is important because people who have P.A.D. are at higher risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), heart attack, stroke, and transient ischemic attack (\"ministroke\"). If you have P.A.D., your doctor also may want to check for signs of these diseases and conditions. Specialists Involved Primary care doctors, such as internists and family doctors, may treat people who have mild P.A.D. For more advanced P.A.D., a vascular specialist may be involved. This is a doctor who specializes in treating blood vessel diseases and conditions. A cardiologist also may be involved in treating people who have P.A.D. Cardiologists treat heart problems, such as CHD and heart attack, which often affect people who have P.A.D. Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask: Whether you have any risk factors for P.A.D. For example, he or she may ask whether you smoke or have diabetes. About your symptoms, including any symptoms that occur when walking, exercising, sitting, standing, or climbing. About your diet. About any medicines you take, including prescription and overthecounter medicines. Whether anyone in your family has a history of heart or blood vessel diseases. Physical Exam During the physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of P.A.D. He or she may check the blood flow in your legs or feet to see whether you have weak or absent pulses. Your doctor also may check the pulses in your leg arteries for an abnormal whooshing sound called a bruit. He or she can hear this sound with a stethoscope. A bruit may be a warning sign of a narrowed or blocked artery. Your doctor may compare blood pressure between your limbs to see whether the pressure is lower in the affected limb. He or she also may check for poor wound healing or any changes in your hair, skin, or nails that may be signs of P.A.D. Diagnostic Tests AnkleBrachial Index A simple test called an anklebrachial index (ABI) often is used to diagnose P.A.D. The ABI compares blood pressure in your ankle to blood pressure in your arm. This test shows how well blood is flowing in your limbs. ABI can show whether P.A.D. is affecting your limbs, but it won't show which blood vessels are narrowed or blocked. A normal ABI result is 1.0 or greater (with a range of 0.90 to 1.30). The test takes about 10 to 15 minutes to measure both arms and both ankles. This test may be done yearly to see whether P.A.D. is getting worse. AnkleBrachial Index Doppler Ultrasound A Doppler ultrasound looks at blood flow in the major arteries and veins in the limbs. During this test, a handheld device is placed on your body and passed back and forth over the affected area. A computer converts sound waves into a picture of blood flow in the arteries and veins. The results of this test can show whether a blood vessel is blocked. The results also can help show the severity of P.A.D. Treadmill Test A treadmill test can show the severity of symptoms and the level of exercise that brings them on. You'll walk on a treadmill for this test. This shows whether you have any problems during normal walking. You may have an ABI test before and after the treadmill test. This will help compare blood flow in your arms and legs before and after exercise. Magnetic Resonance Angiogram A magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) uses magnetic and radio wave energy to take pictures of your blood vessels. This test is a type of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRA can show the location and severity of a blocked blood vessel. If you have a pacemaker, manmade joint, stent, surgical clips, mechanical heart valve, or other metallic devices in your body, you might not be able to have an MRA. Ask your doctor whether an MRA is an option for you. Arteriogram An arteriogram provides a \"road map\" of the arteries. Doctors use this test to find the exact location of a blocked artery. For this test, dye is injected through a needle or catheter (tube) into one of your arteries. This may make you feel mildly flushed. After the dye is injected, an x ray is taken. The xray can show the location, type, and extent of the blockage in the artery. Some doctors use a newer method of arteriogram that uses tiny ultrasound cameras. These cameras take pictures of the insides of the blood vessels. This method is called intravascular ultrasound. Blood Tests Your doctor may recommend blood tests to check for P.A.D. risk factors.

Is not an Italian senator to be preferred to a provincial senator!?\" > Claudius: \"I will soon explain this point to you, when I submit that part of my acts which I performed as censor, but I do not conceive it needful to repel even the provincials who can do honour to the Senate House. Here is this splendid and powerful colony of Vienna; is it so long since it sent to us senators? From that colony comes Lucius Vestinus, one of the glories of the equestrian order, my personal friend, whom I keep close to myself for the management of my private affairs. Let his sons be suffered---I pray you--- to become priests of the lowest rank, while waiting until, with the lapse of years, they can follow the advancement of their dignity. As for that robber, Valerius Asiaticus from Vienna, I will pass over his hateful name. For I detest that hero of the gymnasium, who brought the consulship into his family before even his colony had obtained the full rights of Roman citizenship. I could say as much of his brother, stamped as unworthy by this unlucky relationship, and incapable henceforth of being a useful member of your body.\" > [Interrupting shout]: \"Here now, Tiberius Caesar Germanicus! It's time to let [us senators] understand what your talk is driving at - already you've reached the very limits of Narbonnese Gaul!\" There is a similar example from the reign of Marcus Aurelius. It is essentially an argument over budget regulation of public spectacles, though senators seem to have been a bit more polite: > [A senator]: Concerning the prices of gladiators, however, I expressed a little while ago an opinion in accord with the prescription of [Marcus Aurelius' speech], but I think the rule is formulated in such a way that those prices apply to those states in which prices of gladiators have been flagrantly high. In respect to states which have a rather weak commonwealth, on the other hand, I suggest that these rules which are prescribed in stronger communities be not so rigidly maintained and not place burdens upon them beyond the limit of their strength.... Whilst this is rather mundane, it was important for people to know that these new price regulations were in effect and why they had been implemented. Claudius and Marcus Aurelius were keen on political transparency, and we do not know how normal this practise of publishing unedited senate transcripts across the empire actually was. Other emperors might have just sent out a summary rather than the full debate or ruling, but it seems to have been the main way new laws were communicated."}

{"original_text": "There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Chemoradiation therapy Targeted therapy There are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer. Patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Biologic therapy Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Followup tests may be needed There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. Different types of treatment are available for patients with pancreatic cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery One of the following types of surgery may be used to take out the tumor: Whipple procedure: A surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, and the bile duct are removed. Enough of the pancreas is left to produce digestive juices and insulin. Total pancreatectomy: This operation removes the whole pancreas, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, the common bile duct, the gallbladder, the spleen, and nearby lymph nodes. Distal pancreatectomy: The body and the tail of the pancreas and usually the spleen are removed. If the cancer has spread and cannot be removed, the following types of palliative surgery may be done to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life: Surgical biliary bypass: If cancer is blocking the small intestine and bile is building up in the gallbladder, a biliary bypass may be done. During this operation, the doctor will cut the gallbladder or bile duct and sew it to the small intestine to create a new pathway around the blocked area. Endoscopic stent placement: If the tumor is blocking the bile duct, surgery may be done to put in a stent (a thin tube) to drain bile that has built up in the area. The doctor may place the stent through a catheter that drains to the outside of the body or the stent may go around the blocked area and drain the bile into the small intestine. Gastric bypass: If the tumor is blocking the flow of food from the stomach, the stomach may be sewn directly to the small intestine so the patient can continue to eat normally. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat pancreatic cancer. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. See Drugs Approved for Pancreatic Cancer for more information. Chemoradiation therapy Chemoradiation therapy combines chemotherapy and radiation therapy to increase the effects of both. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow. Erlotinib is a type of TKI used to treat pancreatic cancer. See Drugs Approved for Pancreatic Cancer for more information. There are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer. Pain can occur when the tumor presses on nerves or other organs near the pancreas. When pain medicine is not enough, there are treatments that act on nerves in the abdomen to relieve the pain. The doctor may inject medicine into the area around affected nerves or may cut the nerves to block the feeling of pain. Radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy can also help relieve pain by shrinking the tumor. See the PDQ summary on Cancer Pain for more information. Patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs. Surgery to remove the pancreas may affect its ability to make pancreatic enzymes that help to digest food. As a result, patients may have problems digesting food and absorbing nutrients into the body. To prevent malnutrition, the doctor may prescribe medicines that replace these enzymes. See the PDQ summary on Nutrition in Cancer Care for more information. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.

Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Chemoradiation therapy Targeted therapy There are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer. Patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Biologic therapy Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Followup tests may be needed There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. Different types of treatment are available for patients with pancreatic cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery One of the following types of surgery may be used to take out the tumor: Whipple procedure: A surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, and the bile duct are removed. Enough of the pancreas is left to produce digestive juices and insulin. Total pancreatectomy: This operation removes the whole pancreas, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, the common bile duct, the gallbladder, the spleen, and nearby lymph nodes. Distal pancreatectomy: The body and the tail of the pancreas and usually the spleen are removed. If the cancer has spread and cannot be removed, the following types of palliative surgery may be done to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life: Surgical biliary bypass: If cancer is blocking the small intestine and bile is building up in the gallbladder, a biliary bypass may be done. During this operation, the doctor will cut the gallbladder or bile duct and sew it to the small intestine to create a new pathway around the blocked area. Endoscopic stent placement: If the tumor is blocking the bile duct, surgery may be done to put in a stent (a thin tube) to drain bile that has built up in the area. The doctor may place the stent through a catheter that drains to the outside of the body or the stent may go around the blocked area and drain the bile into the small intestine. Gastric bypass: If the tumor is blocking the flow of food from the stomach, the stomach may be sewn directly to the small intestine so the patient can continue to eat normally. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat pancreatic cancer. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. See Drugs Approved for Pancreatic Cancer for more information. Chemoradiation therapy Chemoradiation therapy combines chemotherapy and radiation therapy to increase the effects of both. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow. Erlotinib is a type of TKI used to treat pancreatic cancer. See Drugs Approved for Pancreatic Cancer for more information. There are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer. Pain can occur when the tumor presses on nerves or other organs near the pancreas. When pain medicine is not enough, there are treatments that act on nerves in the abdomen to relieve the pain. The doctor may inject medicine into the area around affected nerves or may cut the nerves to block the feeling of pain. Radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy can also help relieve pain by shrinking the tumor. See the PDQ summary on Cancer Pain for more information. Patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs. Surgery to remove the pancreas may affect its ability to make pancreatic enzymes that help to digest food. As a result, patients may have problems digesting food and absorbing nutrients into the body. To prevent malnutrition, the doctor may prescribe medicines that replace these enzymes. See the PDQ summary on Nutrition in Cancer Care for more information. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials. Followup tests may be needed Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated.

So the year 100 would be 653 AVC. This is called an Era, which records time from a fixed point in time on. In this case, though, it is a literary invention, created by M. Terrentius Varro around the beginning of the first century BC who calculated the foundation of Rome for the 440th year after the destruction of Troy (in Roman mythology the origin of the Roman founding father, Aeneas), which he put in 1193 BC). Cato did a similar calculation and ended up with 752 BC. The problem with this is that, while seeming convenient, it was rarely practically used outside literature in daily life. Other Eras, which were used to keep track of time, particularly in the East, were the Seleukid Era, beginning in the year 312/311 BC and numerous local Eras that used locally important starting points. Another example for a well known Era would be the counting of the Olympiads. So what system did the Romans use to date a certain event?

These were present in practically all cities, and some of them have thankfully survived which makes them incredibly useful for us.

{"original_text": "As others have explained defined contribution is when you (or your employer) contributes a specified amount and you reap all the investment returns. Defined benefit is when your employer promises to pay you a specified amount (benefit) and is responsible for making the necessary investments to provide for it. Is one better than the other? We can argue this either way. Defined benefit would seem to be more predictable and assured. The problem being of course that it is entirely reliant upon the employer to have saved enough money to pay that amount. If the employer fails in that responsibility, then the only fallback is government guarantees. And of course the government has limitations on what it can guarantee. For example, from Wikipedia: The maximum pension benefit guaranteed by PBGC is set by law and adjusted yearly. For plans that end in 2016, workers who retire at age 65 can receive up to $5,011.36 per month (or $60,136 per year) under PBGC's insurance program for single-employer plans. Benefit payments starting at ages other than 65 are adjusted actuarially, which means the maximum guaranteed benefit is lower for those who retire early or when there is a benefit for a survivor, and higher for those who retire after age 65. Additionally, the PBGC will not fully guarantee benefit improvements that were adopted within the five-year period prior to a plan's termination or benefits that are not payable over a retiree's lifetime. Other limitations also apply to supplemental benefits in excess of normal retirement benefits, benefit increases within the last five years before a plan's termination, and benefits earned after a plan sponsor's bankruptcy. By contrast, people tend to control their own defined contribution accounts. So they control how much gets invested and where. Defined contribution accounts are always 100% funded. Defined benefit pension plans are often underfunded. They expect the employer to step forward and subsidize them when they run short. This allows the defined benefits to both be cheaper during the employment period and more generous in retirement. But it also means that employers have to subsidize the plans later, when they no longer get a benefit from the relationship with the employee. If you want someone else to make promises to you and aren't worried that they won't keep them, you probably prefer defined benefit. If you want to have personal control over the money, you probably prefer defined contribution. My personal opinion is that defined benefit plans are a curse. They encourage risky behavior and false promises. Defined contribution plans are more honest about what they provide and better match the production of employment with its compensation.

They're also a feature of poetry, not for humorous effect (presumably), but to impart double meaning on a line. I was just reading Propertius 3.5 the other day, in which he uses one of Latin's favorite puns, the pun with luxit. Luxit can either be the perfect third person singular of lugeo, to mourn, or of luceo, to shine--in that particular poem, Propertius uses the future perfect form (luxerit) and the line can mean two completely different things, both of which are technically possible.

The purpose of the remark was to subtly brag to Cicero of how important even his sister, who was of course not part of politics directly, was. Cicero didn't take the bait, and instead told Clodius that he shouldn't worry about one foot of his sister's, because he could always raise the other.

{"original_text": "It did, for better and for worse. It's a very good book, and thought-provoking. But it has flaws and those flaws have infected aspects of the study of classical military history. Keegan (1976) created what we refer to as the \"face of battle\" approach to military history. A definition of this approach is succinctly given by Kagan (2006 15): Firstly, the perspective of participants is used to relate events, secondly the writer attempts to convey sense of reality in details through examples, third the writer seeks to establish casual connection between soldiers reaction to weapons and the effectiveness and movement of their combat arms through the battle. As the perspective of soldiers and the psychological aspect of battle is certainly lost in \"general staff\" narratives that only tell us about tactics and major events leading directly to a battle's outcome, Keegan's focus on the experience of the soldier and the importance of morale and fear is refreshing. However, what is his actual \"method\"? In the case of Waterloo and the Somme, he has the actual memoirs and accounts of soldier-participants to build his narrative. It is in Agincourt this method falls down: no such soldier-participant narrative account exists. As such, he constructs the soldier's experience from logical assumptions drawn from the technical characteristics of weapons and armour, and generalised human reactions to fear and weapons applied enmasse to units of soldiers. The logical leaps one must make to reconstruct the outcome of a battle from such a method, as opposed to relying upon the traditional perspective of the commander as viewed through the window of a tactical narrative, should suggest obvious flaws with the method. Put simply, one must assume that groups of men react similarly to fear and weapons, which is not necessarily the case.One must also assume this was the main determining factor in the battle's outcome, which is also not always the case, but one is limited to this view by adopting the narrow perspective of the soldier. Due to these flaws the \"face of battle\" approach often cannot tell us much if anything about what led to a particular outcome in a battle without relying on very broad assumptions- a command-centric approach is more appropriate for answering such questions. What the \"face of battle\" approach does do, if applied liberally, is emphasise the important of psychology, morale and fear as factors in battle, and help us \"recreate\" the experience. The \"face of battle\" approach has been applied first to Greek warfare (Hanson 1989) and later to Roman warfare (Goldsworthy 1996). Due to the gaps in information that Keegan ran into at Agincourt and the ensuing difficulty of'recreating' the experience of a soldier in battle in the classical period (due to lack of soldier-participant accounts), historians have dipped into other fields and theories to fill these gaps. The most obnoxious result of this is the application of modern, post WWII psychological theories to ancient combatants. As a result, Hanson compares the phalanx to a football team scrumming their opponent and Goldsworthy (and his continuators such as Daly) magically turn the Roman army into a modern institution wherein soldiers fought primarily for their \"buddies\" like Easy Company at Bastogne. The annoying thing about this modernising logic being applied to ancient warfare is that this \"buddy theory\" wherein soldiers are primarily motivated in battle by \"not letting their buddies down\", an idea pioneered by Americans (SLA Marshall 1947; Shils & Janowitz 1947) is not even cutting-edge stuff in *modern* military studies. Newer studies of soldier motivation emphasise that more enduring factors in combat are coercive discipline (Bartov 1992) or junior leadership (Rush 2001), which can keep soldiers in the fight whether they are buddies or not. Further, it is questionable whether Roman soldiers really saw their *commilites* as \"buddies\" at all: they might as easily have seen as competitors for distinction, and might have had very little concern for the safety of other soldiers (Lendon 2004, 2005). The application of the \"face of battle\" approach has caused new-age historians like Goldsworthy, just as Keegan did in \"The Face of Battle\", to declare \"traditional\" historians had it all wrong as regards military history, but they haven't actually come up with a new method of analysis: they only have a new perspective. This new perspective is absolutely valuable, but it should not mean that the \"old\" style of battle narrative is now meaningless. Is it more important to recreate the experience of battle and relive it vicariously, full of possibly fantastic conceptions, or do we want to know why battles had certain results, which determined wars, which determined history? If you want the latter, you need to focus on tactics and the commander's perspective. If you want the former, and you're not particularly worried about the occasional bit of fantasy, then stick to the former. A blend between the two approaches is best.

When enough electrons have the energy required to consistently ionize neutral gas atoms, you'll form a plasma. If you make, for example, an argon plasma and then you puff a little bit of another gas into it, all the fast-moving electrons that you already have will collide with that new gas and create ions.

They do so on the basis of a history, a physical, and additional data in the form of tests. Test results do not exist in a vacuum. They must be interpreted in light of the clinical scenario. Tests can be misleading, they can be wrong, and they can suggest the presence of incidental conditions which confuse the diagnosis. Moreover, many disorders do not have a single confirmatory test.

The Report of the Royal Commission in 1945 and 1946 did extensive work into the investigation of these documents and had discovered a vast Soviet spy network across both Canada, the United States, and even Britain. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Federal Bereau Investigation, and MI6 collaberated efforts and ideas from September of 1945 into February of 1946 to prepare for what they knew was going to be a significantly dangerous international affair. Prime Minister Mackenzie King disclosed the existence of a Soviet spy network to the Canadian media in February of 1946, and had arguably inaugurated the Cold War, of which had more or less been boiling for almost 6 months.

{"original_text": "**The Origins and Development of the Guards** The first Guards units were formed in late 1941, at a particularly dark time for the Soviet Union. Soviet political leaders hoped designating high-performing units as \"Guards\" would boost the morale of the newly-minted Guardsmen, many of whom had seen heavy fighting and taken heavy casualties. The new title let them know their service had not gone unrecognized. Furthermore, it help them up as exemplars of fighting spirit to inspire and motivate other units. The title evoked the heroic Red Guards of the Russian Civil War and gave the new Guards units a spiritual connection with their revolutionary predecessors. This was part of a larger Soviet propaganda effort to rally Soviet soldiers and citizens. A March 1946 report in the U.S. Army's *Intelligence Bulletin* states: > This establishment of Red Army Guards units occurred at a time when the Soviet Government was endeavoring to counteract the effects of initial reverses by associating its defensive war with all the greatest days and traditions of Russia's military past. The war with Germany was termed the Fatherland War; new orders and decorations named for great soldiers of Russia's past were created; and Russian patriotism was drawn upon heavily to furnish the steadfastness and energy necessary to stop and drive back the German invaders. Having distinguished themselves in the fighting around Smolensk, the 100th, 127th, 153d and 161st Rifle Divisions became the first Guards Divisions on September 18th, 1941. Under NKO Order No. 308, the respectively became the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Guards Rifle Divisions - *Gvardeiskaya Strelkoviy Divizii* (Guards Rifle Divisions) or GvSD. In the Air Force, the 1st BAP became the first bomber regiment to become a Guards regiment for its perfomance in the Battle of Moscow in 1941. It became 4th GvBAP as a reward for its \"courage demonstrated during air combat with the German fascist invaders, and for the steadfastness, fortitude and heroism of its crews.\" About the same time, some rather irregular units were christened as \"Guards\" for similar motivational reasons. In *Barbarossa,* Alan Clark's writes about some rather rag-tag units that got the Guards title: > There were three generic types of paramilitary civilian units operating around Leningrad in 1941...The largest- the *Opolchenye* or'People's Army'- a more or less enthusiastic rabble, indifferently armed, with only a memory of weekend training in the *Osoaviakhim* and virtually without signals or communications equipment. In addition to \"some\" rifles and machine guns, the workers were armed mainly with molotov cocktails and some hand grenades; they also had 10,000 shot-guns, and about 12,000 small calibre and training rifles donated by the Leningrad's population. The cream of the *Opolchenye* were organised on a divisional basis, with improved equipment and some cadre officers and N.C.O.'s These formations were termed \"Guards\" Divisions by \\[defense commissar Kliment\\] Voroshilov. These short-lived units were soon destroyed or dissolved, and by the end of 1942, the \"Guards\" *Opolchenye* were gone. The desperate campaigns of 1942 and 1943 produced a further parade of Guards units. Every single Guards Rifle Division (GvSD) was created in 1941 to 1943. The last one earned its title in October 1943. As the Soviet forces became more mechanized and started going on the offensive, tank and artillery units got the majority of the Guards titles. The Red Army formed the Guards Army (*Gvardeyskaya Armiya*), army-sized formations with better weapons and equipment. By May 1943, 10 Guards Armies had been formed. The six Tank Armies (*Tankovaya Armiya*) formed in May 1942 were each redesignated as a Guards Tank Armies (*Gvardeyskaya Tankovaya Armiya*) between 1943 and 1944 - this was done less in recognition of their combat performance and more and more to highlight their role as breakthrough forces meant to take part in major offensives. Some specialist units were all-Guards. The *Katyusha* rocket launcher units were all designated as \"Guards Mortar Regiments.\" Almost every Red Army remaining cavalry unit eventually became a Guards unit before the end of the war. After early 1944, once the Soviet position was more secure, no more ground units were converted to Guards, although it seems some aviation units earned the title afterwards. The author of the *Intelligence Bulletin* rightly noted the use of the Guards title could be \"rather elastic,\" since \"units from entire armies down to independent battalions can receive the honor.\" Guards formations could be quite large. In Soviet attack aviation alone, 12 air divisions (the Soviet equivalent of an air wing) and 3 air corps became Guards units - however, not all the sub-units of these large formations necessarily had the \"Guards\" title. You could have a mix of regular and Guards regiments in a \"Guards\" air division, for example. The same was true for ground units, as well. However, getting the \"Guards\" was still a somewhat-selective honor. Of the 365 Soviet attack aviation regiments that flew the Il-2, for example, only 48 earned the \"Guards\" title. By the end of the war, 148 rifle divisions, 20 cavalry divisions, 67 air divisions and 6 tank armies became Guards units. All in all, that meant about 20% percent of Soviet rifle divisions became Guards units and around 30% percent of tank and mechanized units earned the \"Guards\" title. What the Red Army giveth, the Red Army could also taketh away. In the fighting around Debrecen during the the Budapest campaign, the 214th Guard Cavalry Regiment lost its banner.

A March 1946 report in the U.S. Army's *Intelligence Bulletin* states: > This establishment of Red Army Guards units occurred at a time when the Soviet Government was endeavoring to counteract the effects of initial reverses by associating its defensive war with all the greatest days and traditions of Russia's military past. The war with Germany was termed the Fatherland War; new orders and decorations named for great soldiers of Russia's past were created; and Russian patriotism was drawn upon heavily to furnish the steadfastness and energy necessary to stop and drive back the German invaders. Having distinguished themselves in the fighting around Smolensk, the 100th, 127th, 153d and 161st Rifle Divisions became the first Guards Divisions on September 18th, 1941. Under NKO Order No. 308, the respectively became the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Guards Rifle Divisions - *Gvardeiskaya Strelkoviy Divizii* (Guards Rifle Divisions) or GvSD. In the Air Force, the 1st BAP became the first bomber regiment to become a Guards regiment for its perfomance in the Battle of Moscow in 1941. It became 4th GvBAP as a reward for its \"courage demonstrated during air combat with the German fascist invaders, and for the steadfastness, fortitude and heroism of its crews.\" About the same time, some rather irregular units were christened as \"Guards\" for similar motivational reasons. In *Barbarossa,* Alan Clark's writes about some rather rag-tag units that got the Guards title: > There were three generic types of paramilitary civilian units operating around Leningrad in 1941...The largest- the *Opolchenye* or'People's Army'- a more or less enthusiastic rabble, indifferently armed, with only a memory of weekend training in the *Osoaviakhim* and virtually without signals or communications equipment. In addition to \"some\" rifles and machine guns, the workers were armed mainly with molotov cocktails and some hand grenades; they also had 10,000 shot-guns, and about 12,000 small calibre and training rifles donated by the Leningrad's population. The cream of the *Opolchenye* were organised on a divisional basis, with improved equipment and some cadre officers and N.C.O.'s These formations were termed \"Guards\" Divisions by \\[defense commissar Kliment\\] Voroshilov. These short-lived units were soon destroyed or dissolved, and by the end of 1942, the \"Guards\" *Opolchenye* were gone. The desperate campaigns of 1942 and 1943 produced a further parade of Guards units. Every single Guards Rifle Division (GvSD) was created in 1941 to 1943. The last one earned its title in October 1943. As the Soviet forces became more mechanized and started going on the offensive, tank and artillery units got the majority of the Guards titles. The Red Army formed the Guards Army (*Gvardeyskaya Armiya*), army-sized formations with better weapons and equipment. By May 1943, 10 Guards Armies had been formed. The six Tank Armies (*Tankovaya Armiya*) formed in May 1942 were each redesignated as a Guards Tank Armies (*Gvardeyskaya Tankovaya Armiya*) between 1943 and 1944 - this was done less in recognition of their combat performance and more and more to highlight their role as breakthrough forces meant to take part in major offensives. Some specialist units were all-Guards. The *Katyusha* rocket launcher units were all designated as \"Guards Mortar Regiments.\" Almost every Red Army remaining cavalry unit eventually became a Guards unit before the end of the war. After early 1944, once the Soviet position was more secure, no more ground units were converted to Guards, although it seems some aviation units earned the title afterwards. The author of the *Intelligence Bulletin* rightly noted the use of the Guards title could be \"rather elastic,\" since \"units from entire armies down to independent battalions can receive the honor.\" Guards formations could be quite large. In Soviet attack aviation alone, 12 air divisions (the Soviet equivalent of an air wing) and 3 air corps became Guards units - however, not all the sub-units of these large formations necessarily had the \"Guards\" title. You could have a mix of regular and Guards regiments in a \"Guards\" air division, for example. The same was true for ground units, as well. However, getting the \"Guards\" was still a somewhat-selective honor. Of the 365 Soviet attack aviation regiments that flew the Il-2, for example, only 48 earned the \"Guards\" title. By the end of the war, 148 rifle divisions, 20 cavalry divisions, 67 air divisions and 6 tank armies became Guards units. All in all, that meant about 20% percent of Soviet rifle divisions became Guards units and around 30% percent of tank and mechanized units earned the \"Guards\" title. What the Red Army giveth, the Red Army could also taketh away. In the fighting around Debrecen during the the Budapest campaign, the 214th Guard Cavalry Regiment lost its banner. As a punishment, the humiliated unit was reclassified as a penal unit and its commander demoted."}

{"original_text": "This is an interesting question because it still has ramifications today. The Cherokee Freedmen had an ongoing legal battle with the Cherokee Tribe based on ancestral claims of African slaves being owned by the Cherokee. In colonial times, the Cherokee were members of the dubbed Five Civilized Tribes that were viewed as more'civilized' than other Native American groups. Part of this was in part due to embracement of more Western practices. This included ownership of African slaves. During the Trail of Tears over 1,000 African slaves owned by the Cherokee Tribe were removed along with them to Oklahoma. After the conclusion of the Civil War, the Cherokee Nation passed the Treaty of 1866 that banned slavery unless \" otherwise than in the punishment of crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, in accordance with laws applicable to all the members of said tribe alike.\" This matched American laws at the time. The Treaty of 1866 also granted full citizenship to former slaves. These Cherokee Freedmen, sometimes of mixed African and Cherokee heritage, were granted full citizenship to the Cherokee Nation. I am unfamiliar with texts or historical works demonstrating a significant migration to Liberia, but the connection to Freedmen could prove me otherwise. Culturally, today, the Cherokee make up the largest federally recognized Native American tribe comprised of the Eastern Band, the Cherokee Nation, and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee. This all occurred before the formation of the creation of Vai, however. As for the creation of Vai ties to Liberia in terms of Cherokee, there is mixed evidence. Konrad Tuchscherer and P.E.H Hair wrote a piece about the possible connection in 2002. They state, \"no script devised in the last two thousand years is likely to have emerged totally independent of the stimulus of some diffused knowledge of previous scripts...\" \"For over one hundred and fifty years students of the history of writing and the development of scripts have been intrigued by the modern inventions of the Cherokee script, devised in 1821, and the Vai script, devised 1832/33, these being the earliest indigenous script inventions in North America and sub-Sarah Africa respectively (and each continuing in use until today, thus arousing further interest and commitment, scholarly and otherwise). The two scripts have often been cited in parallel as examples of so called \"independent inventions among natives.\" True, the chronology of the inventions is curiously quasi-coincidental, the two dates being little more than a decade apart, while scripts share the same orthographic organization, both being syllabaries. But the similarities end there. The outward forms of characters share almost no graphic similarity.\" The author alludes to a possible connection between North American Protestant missionaries that were involved in works with both the Cherokee and the Vai peoples of Africa and a dissertation written by Svend Holsoe that mentions a Cherokee man that immigrated to Liberia in 1823 named \"Agustus (or Augustin) Curtis\" and that he had possibly settled \"at Cape Mount in Vai country as early as 1829.\" The authors state that Holsoe \"was careful to point out that there was no direct evidence that Curtis was an intermediary.\" The potential may exist for a connection, but the hypothesis has yet to be confirmed, AFAIK.

{"original_text": "There is no current historical consensus on who was Jack the Ripper; nor is there really a most likely candidate at this point. There are several individuals who might be described as *less-unlikely* candidates when viewed through the overlapping lenses of modern criminal psychology and the historical record of suspects considered by contemporary law enforcement. (This category includes Aaron Kosminski and Montague John Druitt, both of whom were on contemporary investigators' radar.) There are other candidates who might be described as *more* unlikely without much disagreement in the broader community -- individuals not under Scotland Yard suspicion at the time of the crimes but identified in hindsight by amateur sleuths chiefly due to their status as high-profile public figures with somewhat shady private lives. (Charles Dodgson, Prince Albert Victor, Walter Sickert, and James Maybrick all fall under this category for me.) There are still other candidates who exist somewhere between these two extremes, and still other hypothesized profiles of totally unidentified perpetrators. These various classes of candidates might appeal to true crime wonks like me, but all evidence remains circumstantial and fragmentary; a lack of rigorous supporting evidence and a lot of conjecture doesn't add up to good historical process *or* compelling criminal psychology. There have also been a number of outright hoaxes and forgeries which muddy the waters, from the hundreds of fraudulent letters sent by disgruntled or simply perverse Londoners in the weeks and months surrounding the attacks to a supposed diary implicating Maybrick that turned up in the early 1990s. Hoaxers, both modern and Victorian, hold in common a desire to insert themselves into a sensational case and to press a single desired conclusion by any means necessary; they both do damage to the historical record. Anyone who touts any kind of unanimous conclusion among historians and aficionados of the Ripper murders, even a purported agreement regarding the number of murders committed by the Ripper or whether a single Ripper existed at all, is trying to sell you something. (Probably a book.) The window of time has passed for any kind of forensic examination that would remotely satisfy a modern courtroom, due to the developing state of 19th century English policing and a limited contemporary understanding of the motives of serial murder; all eyewitnesses are long-dead, as is the perpetrator of the crime, and so are the canonical victims' immediate loved ones. What use is there in studying the Ripper murders if we can no longer identify the killer? The Ripper case isn't a historical stand-alone that can be solved by a decontextualized handwritten confession or a smear of DNA. You can study the details of the case as a collection of stand-alone datapoints, or do your best to reduce it to a sterile forensic study, but to approach the case from a historical perspective is to fling a door wide open onto a much more complex curriculum of historical study -- not just a handful of days in 1888, but a wider social and chronological context. It's worth talking about the Ripper murders in terms of what we can learn and have learned about the material world and especially the print culture of late 19th century London -- police reports, newspapers, letters, memoirs, witness statements, even graffiti; for what we can learn about public attitudes toward crime, class, gender, Whitechapel's Jewish community, the press, policing, and the lives of women who did sex work. What can we learn about homelessness, public housing, labor rights, contagious disease, forensics, and how contemporary Victorians understood these things, or the day-to-day experiences of working-class men and women, immigrants, religious minorities, laborers in all jobs, newspaper readers, crank letter writers? All these things existed in late 19th century London outside the context of the murders of these five (or more) women, but study of the Ripper case affords an opportunity to draw sometimes disparate topics together for easier access and contrast. What can we learn about the historiography of violent crime, and the long shadow of the Ripper over later criminal cases -- is the archetypal killer understood to be an immigrant laborer in a dirty apron, or a gentleman intellectual with connections in the corridors of power? How have these conceptualizations of the Ripper crimes impacted real-life policing and legal precedent? How have the methods employed by law enforcement and journalists alike during the Ripper investigations impacted the lives of individual men and women, even decades later? There's a lot packed into the Ripper case and its adjacent topics that has little if anything to do with the specific identity of the crimes' perpetrator, and that lend the case an enduring interest even in the face of changing attitudes regarding victims and perpetrators of crime. I would urge you to be skeptical of the ongoing cycle of announcements that the Ripper case is closed at last, due to DNA evidence or anything else. The two most prominent claims to solving the Ripper identity question using DNA (the theory proposed by Patricia Cornwell implicating Sickert and the theory proposed by Russell Edwards implicating Kosminski) are both inconclusive, and the 130-plus interval between the deposition of any supposed DNA evidence and its recovery in 2019 renders the provenance of both Cornwell and Edwards samples pretty doubtful.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "There is no current historical consensus on who was Jack the Ripper; nor is there really a most likely candidate at this point. There are several individuals who might be described as *less-unlikely* candidates when viewed through the overlapping lenses of modern criminal psychology and the historical record of suspects considered by contemporary law enforcement. (This category includes Aaron Kosminski and Montague John Druitt, both of whom were on contemporary investigators' radar.) There are other candidates who might be described as *more* unlikely without much disagreement in the broader community -- individuals not under Scotland Yard suspicion at the time of the crimes but identified in hindsight by amateur sleuths chiefly due to their status as high-profile public figures with somewhat shady private lives. (Charles Dodgson, Prince Albert Victor, Walter Sickert, and James Maybrick all fall under this category for me.) There are still other candidates who exist somewhere between these two extremes, and still other hypothesized profiles of totally unidentified perpetrators. These various classes of candidates might appeal to true crime wonks like me, but all evidence remains circumstantial and fragmentary; a lack of rigorous supporting evidence and a lot of conjecture doesn't add up to good historical process *or* compelling criminal psychology. There have also been a number of outright hoaxes and forgeries which muddy the waters, from the hundreds of fraudulent letters sent by disgruntled or simply perverse Londoners in the weeks and months surrounding the attacks to a supposed diary implicating Maybrick that turned up in the early 1990s. Hoaxers, both modern and Victorian, hold in common a desire to insert themselves into a sensational case and to press a single desired conclusion by any means necessary; they both do damage to the historical record. Anyone who touts any kind of unanimous conclusion among historians and aficionados of the Ripper murders, even a purported agreement regarding the number of murders committed by the Ripper or whether a single Ripper existed at all, is trying to sell you something. (Probably a book.) The window of time has passed for any kind of forensic examination that would remotely satisfy a modern courtroom, due to the developing state of 19th century English policing and a limited contemporary understanding of the motives of serial murder; all eyewitnesses are long-dead, as is the perpetrator of the crime, and so are the canonical victims' immediate loved ones.

{"original_text": "There are essentially two ways of picturing the Greek phalanx: 1. As a direct predecessor to the Macedonian pike phalanx: a tightly packed infantry formation with touching or overlapping shields, presenting a wall of spear points to the enemy, with as many ranks as possible sticking their spears over the shields of the men in front of them in order to do their part in presenting an impenetrable front. 2. As a direct successor to the heavy infantry mobs found in Homer and Tyrtaios: a slightly more organised group of heavy infantry, trying to form an unbroken line by deploying in ranks and files, but still not really trained to maintain such a formation on the move, and keeping enough leeway to the left, right and rear to make sure they could wield their spears effectively. You can see the problem: we can't have our cake and eat it too. Version 1 shows that the phalanx is definitely a distinct concept, and explains how the Macedonian phalanx follows from it, but it cannot explain where the phalanx came from, because sources for the period when the drastic shift to organised warfare is supposed to have happened are few and far between. Version 2, meanwhile, does explain how the phalanx evolved from more primitive forms, but has a hard time distinguishing it from any regular old pack of heavy infantry, and struggles to explain the vastly more organised Macedonian phalanx that developed soon after. Traditional scholarship has been firmly on board with version 1, arguing that the Greeks developed a tight and well-organised formation of carefully drilled heavy infantry as early as the late 8th century BC. This is quite doubtful, though, given that the word \"hoplite\" doesn't actually occur in Greek until the 5th century BC, and the technical term \"phalanx\" not until the 4th century BC. More recent scholarship by Krentz and Van Wees has doubted both the nature of this formation and the ability of Archaic Greek society, economy and state organisation to sustain it. They offer version 2 as a more realistic transitional form of infantry organisation that does more justice to the evidence. Both Homer and Tyrtaios suggest that local shield walls frequently emerged even in the looser, less organised combat of the early Archaic period, as men clumped together to advance or to protect or claim a fallen hero. Tyrtaios specifically encourages men to stand close together as they advance, and urges everyone not to hang back but to get stuck in. It is easy to see how this ad-hoc form of group combat would have gradually evolved into larger, homogenous heavy infantry formations as the number of people who could afford heavy equipment increased. The generation or two before the Persian invasions saw an explosion in the number of heavy infantry fielded by Greek city-states. This shift would have encouraged the development of new ways to fight as heavy infantry. And indeed, the earliest unambiguous description of a Greek heavy infantry shieldwall formation occurs in an episode set in 480 BC: > But when the horsemen had encircled the Phokians, they rode at them as if to kill them, and drew their bows to shoot; it is likely too that some did in fact shoot. The Phokians opposed them in every possible way, **drawing in together and closing their ranks to the best of their power.** At this the horsemen wheeled about and rode back and away. -- Hdt. 9.18.1 This is just a passive action, though, and it shows the limited tactical arsenal of the new infantry. Initially these hoplite masses would have been clumsy and unwieldy; they remained skittish throughout the Classical period, and any signs of disorganisation seem to have greatly distressed them, so there were clear incentives to try and develop a more formalised way of managing them and showing them that they did indeed form a solid, unbroken front. However, there is no sign of this happening at this early stage. Herodotos never once mentions the number of ranks of an infantry formation, telling us only in vague terms which part of the line was deep or thin. While the Spartans at Plataia in 479 BC seem to have formed what seems like a defensive shieldwall, it is totally unclear how this was organised, and its passive nature distinguishes it from the steadily marching Spartan phalanx of later times. Here we see clearly what makes a phalanx different. First, it was organised by placing files side by side in an unbroken sequence, organising each file into a roughly set number of ranks. This is first seen at the battle of Delion in 424 BC, where Thucydides tells us the Athenians formed up 8 deep and the Thebans 25 deep, with the Thebans' Boiotian allies - disappointingly - formed up \"as they pleased\". Second, it was organised into sub-units commanded by their own officers. The Athenians went no further than three levels - *strategos, taxiarchos, lochagos* - with the smallest unit being several hundred strong, but the Spartans took this much further, dividing their whole line into troops of about 40 men. These things are first mentioned around the time of the Persian Wars. And thirdly, the phalanx was an offensive weapon. It was not intended to stand and hold the line; it formed up and charged, losing its initial cohesion but presenting its opponent with an oncoming mass of screaming men brandishing spears. Historically, only another heavy infantry formation could withstand this onslaught. From Xenophon onward, in the 4th century BC, this form of heavy infantry organisation is referred to as a *phalanx*.^1 The phalanx, then, was slightly more organised than an ordinary shieldwall, but we shouldn't overestimate how different it was. Only the Spartans were trained to retain their organisation in ranks and files while marching. The Greeks made the first few steps towards effective heavy infantry organisation, but their own reluctance to submit to military authority prevented them from going further down this path. But then how did we get from this clumsy, only-somewhat-organised mass to the Macedonian phalanx? Scholars have suggested a gradual development, but this is very hard to trace in the sources; most Greeks don't seem to develop their infantry formations at all. The Spartan organisation would definitely have served as an example, though. Quite possibly, Philip II also borrowed some ideas from his godfather Iphikrates, who allegedly reorganised his mercenary hoplites into pikemen to fight the renowned and feared Egyptian pike infantry. Perhaps the entire concept of well-drilled pike blocks was borrowed from Egypt - we simply don't know. The reforms of Philip II are frustratingly obscure. However, it is easy enough to see that his military organisation was only a step or two away from the one used by the Greeks - if only they'd had the resources and the willingness to commit to it. I hope this answers your questions. Let me know if you'd like me to blather more! *Note* 1) Homer already uses the plural *phalanges* (literally meaning \"stacks\" or \"logs\") to refer to masses of infantry. This (among other things) has led some scholars (notably Latacz) to argue that Homer already described a world of phalanx battle. However, Homer and Xenophon do not use the word in the same way; Xenophon uses it in the singular to refer to the entire battle line, which no author before him had done. Thucydides never uses the word at all, and refers to a battle line as a *taxis*.

{"original_text": "It is not \"known.\" It's hypothesized based on indirect observations called proxies. One of the best and most commonly used proxies for estimating paleotemperatures is the abundance of heavy stable isotopes of common elements like Oxygen. Two stable isotopes of Oxygen have atomic masses 16 and 18 and because of their difference in mass, molecules that include them such as water or carbonate (CO3), will respond differently during phase changes. Molecules containing the heavier isotope will condense out before the lighter isotope, a process called fractionation. However the exact ratio of fractionation depends on the ambient temperature at which the phase change occurs with the imbalance decreasing the warmer the temperature is. So the ratio of 18-O to 16-O in ice (in the case of relatively recent records from e.g. glacial cores) or in the calcium carbonate fossil shells of animals (in very ancient records where there is no continuous ice record) can be measured and the temperature at which they formed reconstructed.

One of the best and most commonly used proxies for estimating paleotemperatures is the abundance of heavy stable isotopes of common elements like Oxygen. Two stable isotopes of Oxygen have atomic masses 16 and 18 and because of their difference in mass, molecules that include them such as water or carbonate (CO3), will respond differently during phase changes. Molecules containing the heavier isotope will condense out before the lighter isotope, a process called fractionation. However the exact ratio of fractionation depends on the ambient temperature at which the phase change occurs with the imbalance decreasing the warmer the temperature is. So the ratio of 18-O to 16-O in ice (in the case of relatively recent records from e.g. glacial cores) or in the calcium carbonate fossil shells of animals (in very ancient records where there is no continuous ice record) can be measured and the temperature at which they formed reconstructed.

{"original_text": "The selective pressure that we put on crop plants is enormous, so in thinking about agronomically useful traits, \"drift\" is not really an operative term. We selectively breed or engineer crops (and I'll stick to plants, being a plant biochemist) to have the properties we want, in terms of yield, pest and disease resistance, drought tolerance, etc. So if there is any genetic drift of these agronomically important genes, it will be unidirectional, because we will have selected for it. Of course the majority of genes in the genome will not be selected for, but may be still be important for traits that are not under selective pressure, so in that case, I guess I have to edit myself and say that genetic drift could be operative in crop plants, but that it will be under our radar. Anyway, back to those selectable traits: In many cases, the genetic bases of useful phenotypes are known, and in all cases they could be known with sufficient investment of genetic and genomic resources. That is, we either do now, or could in the future, know the specific genetic sequences and their variants that control any trait, i.e. how big a tomato will get, or how tall a wheat plant will get, etc. This plays into the \"information\" aspect of your question. Sequencing technology is advancing at a rate such that we will very soon be able to sequence the entire genome of every cultivar of every crop plant ever cultivated (assuming we have the seed for it), and then store that information in perpetuity.

We selectively breed or engineer crops (and I'll stick to plants, being a plant biochemist) to have the properties we want, in terms of yield, pest and disease resistance, drought tolerance, etc. So if there is any genetic drift of these agronomically important genes, it will be unidirectional, because we will have selected for it. Of course the majority of genes in the genome will not be selected for, but may be still be important for traits that are not under selective pressure, so in that case, I guess I have to edit myself and say that genetic drift could be operative in crop plants, but that it will be under our radar. Anyway, back to those selectable traits: In many cases, the genetic bases of useful phenotypes are known, and in all cases they could be known with sufficient investment of genetic and genomic resources. That is, we either do now, or could in the future, know the specific genetic sequences and their variants that control any trait, i.e. how big a tomato will get, or how tall a wheat plant will get, etc. This plays into the \"information\" aspect of your question. Sequencing technology is advancing at a rate such that we will very soon be able to sequence the entire genome of every cultivar of every crop plant ever cultivated (assuming we have the seed for it), and then store that information in perpetuity.

{"original_text": "I'm almost certain that this is not being done in human fetuses. Gene therapy stumbled a bit after initial success with treating SCID [1] with a later consequence of blood cancer. SCID is an immune disease in which an important gene is totally non-functional, so in these trials the researchers removed marrow from the patients, infected the cells with a retrovirus that contained a functional copy of the important gene, and put the marrow back. That idea is still what gene therapy can do, but now we have better tools (in trials). Retroviruses (HIV is an example) were initially used because they efficiently add DNA to a host genome and cells taken from a human body don't do well for very long. So whatever we do has to be fast. The problem is that retroviruses stick their DNA randomly (though not uniformly randomly [3]) into the host genome. Add to that the fact that millions of cells are infected at a time, each cell ending up with the virus landing in a different part of the genome. And so the chances are not too shabby that the virus will land close to genes that promote cell growth and division. This is what happened in the SCID cases mentioned above. The virus landed in front of and then turned on \"oncogenes\" that, when activated inappropriately, allow cells to replicate unchecked. And so many of the children ended up developing cancer (though they were cured of SCID). These days people are trying thinks like Zinc Finger Nucleases and TALENS that can be engineered in the lab and targeted to specific spots in the genome. These have the additional benefit that, not only can you add genetic material (like with retroviruses) but you can also edit the genome directly. These things are in various clinical trials around the world. The main problem now is getting those modifying reagents into the target cells. It is a very hard problem (for reasons I won't go into since this is already super long). In direct answer to your questions: (1) It has been done successfully, though mostly in animal models (mice, zebrafish, cattle). (2) (This is simplified tremendously) With retroviruses, the virus is modified to have some of its genes replaced with whatever you want to add to the target genome. Virus is then made in one set of cells, harvested, and used to treat other cells. That virus then inserts its genome (and your gene along with it) into the target cells' genomes, and those target cells can be somehow put back into a patient. With targeted (e.g. ZFNs and TALENS) approaches, a series of proteins have to be engineered to bind specifically to one spot in the genome and cut the DNA there. Then those proteins have be somehow put into the cell (there are many ways, and this step is the biggest hurdle). Finally the cells need be put back into the patient (unless you somehow find a way to get the ZFNs to the cells within the patient, which is the eventual goal). (3) No idea, but the technology is outpacing the law so probably there isn't much. (4) The risks are: off-target integrations (like in the SCID case), that cells taken out of the body will have change in undesirable ways before being put back, and that we might not understand the biology enough to predict consequences of any particular change to the genome. In principle the targeted approach is very safe, it's just that we don't know how to get the reagents to target cells in the human body.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I'm almost certain that this is not being done in human fetuses.

That virus then inserts its genome (and your gene along with it) into the target cells' genomes, and those target cells can be somehow put back into a patient. With targeted (e.g. ZFNs and TALENS) approaches, a series of proteins have to be engineered to bind specifically to one spot in the genome and cut the DNA there. Then those proteins have be somehow put into the cell (there are many ways, and this step is the biggest hurdle). Finally the cells need be put back into the patient (unless you somehow find a way to get the ZFNs to the cells within the patient, which is the eventual goal). (3) No idea, but the technology is outpacing the law so probably there isn't much. (4) The risks are: off-target integrations (like in the SCID case), that cells taken out of the body will have change in undesirable ways before being put back, and that we might not understand the biology enough to predict consequences of any particular change to the genome. In principle the targeted approach is very safe, it's just that we don't know how to get the reagents to target cells in the human body."}

One classic example is the Weierstrass function, which is a continuous but nowhere differentiable function.

In physics, another example is the Heaviside step function, which is a function that represents the sudden change in the electric current when a switch is turned on. This function is not differentiable at the point of the step, as it has a discontinuity in its derivative.

{"original_text": "Treatments are available for all patients who have colon cancer. The choice of treatment depends on the size, location, and stage of the cancer and on the patient's general health. Doctors may suggest several treatments or combinations of treatments. Surgery Is the Most Common First Step in a Treatment Regimen The three standard treatments for colon cancer are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Surgery, however, is the most common first step in the treatment for all stages of colon cancer. Surgery is an operation to remove the cancer. A doctor may remove the cancer using several types of surgery. Local Excision If the cancer is found at a very early stage, the doctor may remove it without cutting through the abdominal wall. Instead, the doctor may put a tube up the rectum into the colon and cut the cancer out. This is called a local excision. If the cancer is found in a polyp, which is a small bulging piece of tissue, the operation is called a polypectomy. Colectomy If the cancer is larger, the surgeon will remove the cancer and a small amount of healthy tissue around it. This is called a colectomy. The surgeon may then sew the healthy parts of the colon together. Usually, the surgeon will also remove lymph nodes near the colon and examine them under a microscope to see whether they contain cancer. Colostomy If the doctor is not able to sew the two ends of the colon back together, an opening called a stoma is made on the abdomen for waste to pass out of the body before it reaches the rectum. This procedure is called a colostomy. Sometimes the colostomy is needed only until the lower colon has healed, and then it can be reversed. But if the doctor needs to remove the entire lower colon or rectum, the colostomy may be permanent. Adjuvant Chemotherapy Even if the doctor removes all of the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, many patients receive chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Chemotherapy treatment after surgery to increase the chances of a cure is called adjuvant therapy. Researchers have found that patients who received adjuvant therapy usually survived longer and went for longer periods of time without a recurrence of colon cancer than patients treated with surgery alone. Patients age 70 and older benefited from adjuvant treatment as much as their younger counterparts. In fact, adjuvant therapy is equally as effective and no more toxic for patients 70 and older as it is for younger patients, provided the older patients have no other serious diseases. Adjuvant chemotherapy is standard treatment for patients whose cancer is operable and who are at high risk for a recurrence of the disease. Most cases of colon cancer occur in individuals age 65 and over. But studies have shown that older patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy less frequently than younger patients. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the use of anticancer drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy may be taken by mouth, or it may be put into the body by inserting a needle into a vein or muscle. One form of chemotherapy is called systemic treatment because the drugs enter the bloodstream, travel through the body, and can kill cancer cells throughout the body. The other form of chemotherapy is called targeted therapy because the drug affects only the factors that are causing the cancer and does not perturb the rest of the body. Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy is the use of xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Most often, doctors use it for patients whose cancer is in the rectum. Doctors may use radiation before surgery to shrink a tumor in the rectum and make it easier to remove. Or, they may use it after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that remain in the treated area. The radiation may come from a machine or from implants placed directly into or near the tumor. Radiation that comes from a machine is called external radiation. Radiation that uses implants is known as internal radiation.

{"original_text": "The best reading for this question (as with any on Reconstruction) is Eric Foner's *Reconstruction* or the abridged *A Short History of Reconstruction*. Both are very readable. But since this is such a huge question, any answer here is going to have a lot of generalisations and points to challenge. But I'll answer it to the best of my ability. Between Congress, the Presidency, southern Democratic (generally former slaveowners), and southern Republican (the so-called'carpetbaggers','scalawags', and, from 1857, freedmen), there wasn't any single approach to economic policy in the South. So there are a huge number of actors with power to shape aspects of economic policy, and these change over time. Also remember that there wasn't a consensus on economic policy in the North either, between protectionists and free traders; paper money advocates, silver activists, and greenbackers; and nascent labour activists and a growing bourgeoisie. (If you want to read more about these people, go for Sven Beckert's *Monied Metropolis*, but it's a little dense.) At the start of Reconstruction the federal government does have some experience in dealing with some of the economic aspects of Reconstruction in southern Louisiana and occupied islands off South Carolina. However, the military is generally given a free hand to settle these questions as it likes on the ground, and local officers do what they can based on local needs. Banks and Butler in New Orleans do this by trying to put slaves (and they are still legally slaves right up until the Thirteenth Amendment) back on sugar plantations, in South Carolina the planters have fled so the Union lets freedmen generally farm as they like, and in Georgia and South Carolina Sherman and Sheridan assign freedmen land to farm as they wish, but without any intention for this to be a permanent solution. There's no real comprehensive'policy' as far as we would understand it other than getting the cash crop industry back on track. The Treasury Dept at this point is trying to keep itself solvent more than anything else. However, as the shift focuses from war to Reconstruction, there is a debate between different Northern policymakers over land redistribution which shapes what the Southern economy will look like going forward. Supporters of land redistribution support seizing Southern planters' lands and handing it to freedmen to engage in subsistence agriculture, which is already a large part of the Southern economy outside of the cotton belt. This also looks similar to the ideal of the Homestead Act, which gives away plots of Western (Native Americans') land to farmers to grow their way to self-reliance. The opponents of redistribution are a diverse group, but those who don't just define policy in terms of opposition to redistribution generally envision freedmen farming cash crops for wages with their former planters as employers. This is a policy that speaks to a lot of Republicans who joined the movement in the 1850s under the banner of'free labor', who assume that the free market will allow freedmen to save, acquire property, and eventually acquire land by themselves just as Northern factory workers can save and eventually become propertied artisans. In theory. Despite the so-called'Radical' phase of Reconstruction after 1857, land redistribution never happens, though South Carolina has a good go. However, the wage system never takes off either. At the same time, you also have Southern policymakers. Without a great deal of federal direction this is left to the states themselves, but there are similarities between them. Under Andrew Johnson, former slaveholders are generally left in charge of state governments, and their policy is to return back to the antebellum status quo, using state authority over black subjects rather than the master-slave power relationship. So you might say their economic policy is to return to the political economy of slavery, based on cash crop agriculture. In 1867 Congress kicks out these governments and provides for black suffrage and confederate disenfranchisement. These governments try and modernise the Southern economy, mainly by building railroads, universities, and infrastructure, and social welfare and emulating the Northern industrial boom that has bypassed the South.* This is a huge sweeping generalisation - freedmen on homesteads still grow some cotton for the market to earn cash, and planter-led governments also invest in railroads and infrastructure, but this is, I hope, a fair reflection of Southern states' economic policies in the period. These all fail. There's no real redistribution, but there's no money for new infrastructure or the resurrection of the cotton industry either. There's no New Deal-esque public injection of capital into the Southern economy, and private capital can get better returns in the North. The Southern economy therefore just never has the cash circulating to invest in cotton or railroads, or much else. So in practice, the South turns to the barter economy of sharecropping. So you might say that, in the absence of any agreement on an economic policy for the South and political will to see it through, the most striking aspect of Federal policymaking over the South is one of neglect, even before the Federal government actively turns against Reconstruction and the increasingly active labour movement in the North in the 1870s.

In the early days of automotive electronics, 12V was chosen as a compromise between the voltage required for spark plugs (6V) and the voltage needed for accessories (24V). This allowed for a single, standardized voltage that could power various components. Additionally, 12V is a relatively low voltage, making it safer and more efficient for many applications. It's also a convenient voltage for many electronic components, which often have a 12V rating. As a result, the industry has standardized on 12V, making it the de facto standard.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "A 12V DC power system is a type of power system that uses a single voltage rating, usually 12V, to power a variety of electronic components, such asECUs, computers, and actuators.

Being exposed to ultraviolet radiation may increase the risk of skin cancer. Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin. The skin is the body's largest organ. It protects against heat, sunlight, injury, and infection. Skin also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and vitamin D. The skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the epidermis (top or outer layer) and the dermis (lower or inner layer). Skin cancer begins in the epidermis, which is made up of three kinds of cells: Squamous cells: Thin, flat cells that form the top layer of the epidermis. Cancer that forms in squamous cells is called squamous cell carcinoma. Basal cells: Round cells under the squamous cells. Cancer that forms in basal cells is called basal cell carcinoma. Melanocytes: Found in the lower part of the epidermis, these cells make melanin, the pigment that gives skin its natural color. When skin is exposed to the sun, melanocytes make more pigment and cause the skin to tan, or darken. Cancer that forms in melanocytes is called melanoma. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are also called nonmelanoma skin cancer and are the most common forms of skin cancer. Most basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers can be cured. Melanoma is more likely to spread to nearby tissues and other parts of the body and can be harder to cure. Melanoma is easier to cure if the tumor is found before it spreads to the dermis (inner layer of skin). Melanoma is less likely to cause death when it is found and treated early. In the United States, the number of cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer seems to have increased in recent years. The number of cases of melanoma has increased over the last 30 years. Part of the reason for these increases may be that people are more aware of skin cancer. They are more likely to have skin exams and biopsies and to be diagnosed with skin cancer. Over the past 20 years, the number of deaths from melanoma has decreased slightly among white men and women younger than 50 years. During that time, the number of deaths from melanoma has increased slightly among white men older than 50 years and stayed about the same among white women older than 50 years. The number of cases of childhood melanoma diagnosed in the United States is low, but increasing over time.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."}

There are less gaps than there used to be for Hellenistic Bactria, and we are just starting to find things out about Achaemenid Bactria, but pre-Persian Bactria is almost a mystery. To give you a quick timeline, the first part of Bactrian history we have an inkling of is the period associated with the'BMAC'. This excitingly stands for the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex. It's also known as the Oxus Civilization but most of the Central Asian historians won't thank you for it. This material culture phase seems to have developed out of cultures that already existed in the area, it's not a sudden case of'and suddenly there was a migration'. By around 2300 BC the BMAC seems to have developed a lot of the hallmarks of a'civilization'; developed agriculture, bureaucracy, urban environments. The only thing missing from the traditional picture is writing. Interestingly, there appears to have been some sort of link between the BMAC and the Elamites in what would become Persis or Persia. Also, there was a trading colony from the Harappan civilization (the Indus valley civilization if we want to call them that) in Bactria during this period. There's gold, lapis lazuli and other precious materials in Bactria so there's a lot they could have been angling for. The site was unexpectedly discovered by a team looking at irrigation in the Oxus valley, it was somewhat of a surprise at the time. The next time that Bactria properly appears on the radar is about 500 BC. Seriously. And that's when we have it appearing as a satrapy of the Achaemenid Persians in the Behistun inscription. We don't know if there was a kingdom based in Bactria, or elsewhere in Central Asia. What we do know is that at this point, it's clear the Bactrians and Persians (Elamites are not Persians, they have a different heritage but the Elamite legacy got adopted by the Persians) are related; they were both Indo-European people, Indo-Iranian specifically, and spoke an Iranian language. In fact during this time we can't distinguish Old Persian and Bactrian. Helpful, isn't it. We used to know nothing more about this period, but the antiquities market turned up about 30 documents from the Achaemenid satrapy of Bactria that's given us a wealth of new information. When Bactria first properly becomes evidenced is the Hellenistic era. We have a major Greek city that was partially excavated called Ai Khanoum, founded on the site of a previous Achaemenid fort. We have quite a number of temples associated or founded in this period, and layers of several significant cities like Samarkhand and Merv associated with this period. We have a tiny amount of hugely unreliable literary sources from the Greek world, which is still better than none! We have lots and lots of coins from this period that have cleared up things a bit. We even have some literature from Hellenistic Bactria, in the form of parchments and papyri, along with lots of ostraka. Alexander conquered Bactria initially, then in the scuffles known as the Successor Wars the man called Seleucus ended up taking control of all of Alexander's Asian territory (the war broke out as he had no clear successor according to Macedonian traditions of these things). This included Bactria, which he launched an expedition to integrate in 307 BC. The satrapy eventually declared independence in the 240s BC as a kingdom led by a Greek royal family. The Seleucids tried to recover it, failed, and Bactria then lead an interesting and eventful life that included conquering bits of India until about 140-130 BC, when large amounts of nomads swept over the frontier. After an interregnum of about 100 years, an Empire formed by some of these nomadic peoples formed around a Bactrian core. This is known as the Kushan Empire, which lasted from about 60 AD to the 360s AD. It was quite an interesting Empire, lots of influences from previous controllers but also lots of newer ones.

If there's more energy than atoms, so to speak, the atoms stay excited."}

Preconception care refers to the health care that women and men receive before becoming pregnant to help them achieve a healthy pregnancy and reduce the risk of birth defects and other health problems. Some key components of preconception care include: * Getting regular check-ups with a healthcare provider * Discussing any health concerns or medical conditions with a healthcare provider * Taking folic acid supplements to prevent birth defects * Maintaining a healthy weight and diet * Avoiding certain medications and substances that can harm a developing fetus * Getting vaccinated against certain diseases, such as rubella and varicella It's also important to note that preconception care is not just for women - men can also play a role in preparing their bodies for a healthy pregnancy.

{"original_text": "I wouldn't consider August 1789 the start of the French Revolution, but it's difficult to pinpoint an exact date for when it did start. I'll get to that later. What was significant about August was that that was when the August Decrees were passed by the National Assembly. These were the decrees abolishing feudalism and the privileged classes, which essentially destroyed seigneurial rights and privileges. How did the Old Regime collapse? Well, like I said it's difficult to pinpoint how it started. It was a very long process, and one can arguably make a case for it starting as early as 1763 with the end of the Seven Years War. A simplified version is that social and economic issues weakened the king's power, drained the French treasury (the Crown was declared bankrupt on Aug 16, 1788), ravaged the French economy (a worker could expect to spend 88% of his income on bread by 1789) and created organised opposition to the king. The organised opposition to the king is what's important here. A number of nobles, along with some of the richer and more educated Third Estate deputies (common people who were elected to the Estates-General, a meeting of all the social orders throughout the country) declared themselves the National Assembly and the legitimate government of France. After some minor resistance from the king, he was forced to accept their declaration, and France was governed as a constitutional monarchy - so no, the king was not immediately deposed in 1789. In August, the National Assembly approved a number of decrees abolishing feudalism. This was the start of a long reform program which attempted to pull France out of feudalism with such reforms as the separation of church and state, religious freedoms, a constitution, etc. There's a lot of misconceptions about the revolution of 1789, which I've mentioned here. First, the king was not immediately deposed - that didn't happen until 1792 in August. Second, there was no single date which can be pinpointed to the immediate collapse of the old order - was it June, when the National Assembly was declared? July, when the Bastille was stormed and the last semblance of royal authority destroyed? August? October? One can make a case for all of those dates. Third, men like Robespierre and Danton, and the radical sans-culotte (urban working class) had little involvement with the events of 1789 beyond just being there to back up the real revolutionaries: the upper middle class and the aristocracy, who declared themselves the National Assembly and passed the August Decrees.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I wouldn't consider August 1789 the start of the French Revolution, but it's difficult to pinpoint an exact date for when it did start.

The ball game was played in Michoacan, but the extent of it's popularity is still kind of up in the air. The only site *that we know of* which had a ball court used during the Late Postclassic (Tarascan-era) is at the site of Ihuatzio. In fact, Ihuatzio was originally called Quer\u00e9taro which in P'urepecha' means \"Place of the Ball Court.\" Ihuatzio was also a major religious center in the empire, and it appears to have been the one and only location in the Lake P\u00e1tzcuaro Basin where we can be sure the game was played in the decades leading up to Spanish contact.

The ballgame was popular during the empire as well, but only one ball court was used for the Lake Basin proper. Other sites outside of the Lake Basin had ball courts. In order to narrow down those possibilities we'd have to date the ballcourts at Angamuco and conduct much more extensive archaeological work in the highland areas adjacent to Lake P\u00e1tzcuaro.

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Mesomelic dwarfism of hypoplastic tibia and radius type. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance Hypoplasia of the radius Mesomelic short stature Neonatal shortlimb short stature Pseudoarthrosis Short tibia The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."}

{"original_text": "What the Kidneys Do You have two kidneys. They are beanshaped and about the size of a fist. They are located in the middle of your back, on the left and right of your spine, just below your rib cage. The kidneys filter your blood, removing wastes and extra water to make urine. They also help control blood pressure and make hormones that your body needs to stay healthy. When the kidneys are damaged, wastes can build up in the body. Kidney Function and Aging Kidney function may be reduced with aging. As the kidneys age, the number of filtering units in the kidney may decrease, the overall amount of kidney tissue may decrease, and the blood vessels that supply the kidney may harden, causing the kidneys to filter blood more slowly. If your kidneys begin to filter less well as you age, you may be more likely to have complications from certain medicines. There may be an unsafe buildup of medicines that are removed from your blood by your kidneys. Also, your kidneys may be more sensitive to certain medicines. For example, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and some antibiotics may harm your kidneys in some situations. The next time you pick up a prescription or buy an overthecounter medicine or supplement, ask your pharmacist how the product may affect your kidneys and interact with your other medicines.

Learn more about how the kidneys work. How Kidney Disease Occurs Kidney disease means the kidneys are damaged and can no longer remove wastes and extra water from the blood as they should. Kidney disease is most often caused by diabetes or high blood pressure. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 20 million Americans may have kidney disease. Many more are at risk. The main risk factors for developing kidney disease are diabetes high blood pressure cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) disease a family history of kidney failure. diabetes high blood pressure cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) disease a family history of kidney failure. Each kidney contains about one million tiny filtering units made up of blood vessels. These filters are called glomeruli. Diabetes and high blood pressure damage these blood vessels, so the kidneys are not able to filter the blood as well as they used to. Usually this damage happens slowly, over many years. This is called chronic kidney disease. As more and more filtering units are damaged, the kidneys eventually are unable to maintain health. Early kidney disease usually has no symptoms, which means you will not feel different. Blood and urine tests are the only way to check for kidney damage or measure kidney function. If you have diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or a family history of kidney failure, you should be tested for kidney disease. Kidney Failure Kidney disease can get worse over time, and may lead to kidney failure. Kidney failure means very advanced kidney damage with less than 15% normal function. Endstage renal disease (ESRD) is kidney failure treated by dialysis or kidney transplant. If the kidneys fail, treatment options such as dialysis or a kidney transplant can help replace kidney function. Some patients choose not to treat kidney failure with dialysis or a transplant. If your kidneys fail, talk with your health care provider about choosing a treatment that is right for you. (Watch the video to learn more about how kidney disease progresses.

This is called chronic kidney disease. As more and more filtering units are damaged, the kidneys eventually are unable to maintain health. Early kidney disease usually has no symptoms, which means you will not feel different. Blood and urine tests are the only way to check for kidney damage or measure kidney function. If you have diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or a family history of kidney failure, you should be tested for kidney disease. Kidney Failure Kidney disease can get worse over time, and may lead to kidney failure. Kidney failure means very advanced kidney damage with less than 15% normal function. Endstage renal disease (ESRD) is kidney failure treated by dialysis or kidney transplant. If the kidneys fail, treatment options such as dialysis or a kidney transplant can help replace kidney function. Some patients choose not to treat kidney failure with dialysis or a transplant. If your kidneys fail, talk with your health care provider about choosing a treatment that is right for you. (Watch the video to learn more about how kidney disease progresses.

This is what's going on inside a ferromagnet like the one you describe. If you were to shave a little off the end then the rest of the atoms would be pretty much unaffected. You would still have a magnet, but it would be (very) slightly weaker due to having fewer atoms contributing to the overall field. If you were to break a magnet in half you would end up with two smaller (and weaker) magnets for the same reason. Each one would have two poles like the original one did."}
{"original_text": "What causes galactosialidosis? Galactosialidosis is caused by mutations in the CTSA gene. The CTSA gene provides instructions for making a protein called cathepsin A, which is active in cellular compartments called lysosomes. These compartments contain enzymes that digest and recycle materials when they are no longer needed. Cathepsin A works together with two enzymes, neuraminidase 1 and betagalactosidase, to form a protein complex. This complex breaks down sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins) or fats (glycolipids). Cathepsin A is also found on the cell surface, where it forms a complex with neuraminidase 1 and a protein called elastin binding protein. Elastin binding protein plays a role in the formation of elastic fibers, a component of the connective tissues that form the body's supportive framework. CTSA mutations interfere with the normal function of cathepsin A. Most mutations disrupt the protein structure of cathepsin A, impairing its ability to form complexes with neuraminidase 1, betagalactosidase, and elastin binding protein. As a result, these other enzymes are not functional, or they break down prematurely. Galactosialidosis belongs to a large family of lysosomal storage disorders, each caused by the deficiency of a specific lysosomal enzyme or protein. In galactosialidosis, impaired functioning of cathepsin A and other enzymes causes certain substances to accumulate in the lysosomes.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "What causes galactosialidosis?

When you say sound doesn't exist, would that mean vibrations and waves don't exist either, as they produce sound? When you hit 2 mugs together, it's the mug vibrating that makes the sound, so if you take away the mugs ability to vibrate, there would be no sound. However, taking away the ability of things to vibrate in physics is like taking away one of the fundamentals of physics.

While it's true that Germany has made efforts to acknowledge and educate about its Nazi past, the UK has also begun to confront its own history of colonialism and imperialism. Here are a few examples: * The British Empire's role in the transatlantic slave trade and the ongoing legacy of slavery and racism in the UK. * The Amritsar Massacre in 1919, where British troops killed hundreds of unarmed Indian civilians. * The Mau Mau uprising in Kenya, where British colonial forces tortured and killed thousands of Kenyan rebels. * The Balfour Declaration in 1917, which supported the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, leading to the displacement of Palestinians. * The UK's role in the Indian Partition and the subsequent violence and displacement of millions of people.

Additionally, European powers often placed indigenous leaders in power, encouraging them to compete with one another and maintain order within their respective territories.

TL;DR: ATP allows the spent myosin to unbind actin in order to restart another power stroke."}

As you might know, the variance of the log stock price in Black Scholes is vol^2 * T, in other words, variance of the log stock price is linear in time to expiry. Now, that means that the standard deviation of your log stock price is square root in time. This is consequential. For normally distributed random variables, in 68% of cases we end up within one standard deviation. So, basically, we expect our log stock price to be within something something times square root of T.

{"original_text": "Portugal and various Spanish kingdoms (Leon, Castille, Navarra, Aragon, and their various union states) had waged a whole bunch of wars between each other during medieval and early modern years over various reasons, often involving attempts to take over the other's country. What might surprise you was that there were several real attempts by Portugal to take over the Castillian throne too! **Medival concept of conquest** But first you should really be aware that in the medieval and early modern European world you didn't really just invade cause you think someone was a threat and especially you couldn't *just* annex countries. You needed a reason to attack, you also needed a strong, legal, claim to the throne to claim it, and most importantly you needed a strong army to actually pull it off. Of course, that didn't really stop anyone attempting, even when the legality was a bit iffy. Portugal's proclamation of independence in 1129 and kingdom in 1139 was one such case. But successful military actions brought a de facto independence in 1140s, and long lobbying at the Papacy(through crusading actions as well as showering the local bishops with lands and rights) brought them recognition and political, de jure, independence in 1179. This is a gross simplification but explaining overall Iberian medieval politics is too complex for me to try to unravel, but basically in middle ages, Iberian kingdoms usually respected each others independence status (borders not so much) until they had a strong claim to the other throne. This wasn't uncommon as royalty of the various kingdoms often intermarried and had a lot of illegitimate, but recognized and respected children adding to the mix. **Crisis of the 1383-1385** In 1383 Portugal was in one such situation when king Ferdinand of Portugal died with no sons and his daughter and heir was married to king of Castille John I. What was worse king Ferdinand for a long time led a serious of wars against Castille, trying to put himself or one of his allies on the throne. The wars were not only unsuccessful, but almost disastrous economically to the Portuguese. Especially the last one which was a complete defeat of the Portuguese. But the Castillians couldn't just take over Portugal despite the win, but arranged a marriage which would basically put the Castillian on the throne in the next generation. So when the king Ferdinand I died, his daughter and her Castillian husband were suppose to inherit the crown. The Portuguese populace was unhappy (nobility was divided, but slightly more pro-Castillian) and proclaimed their own Jo\u00e3o I as new king of Portugal. Jo\u00e3o was illegitimate half-brother of Ferdinand, and master of knightly order of Aviz. He was actually the half-brother of Ferdinand with the least claim to the throne but the other brothers were both in Castille (and then captured) so not available and not viewed favorably anyway. Castillian king John I then sent armies to Portugal, as he was *legally* the one in the right (even though Portuguese lawyers rejected his legal right). His armies were surprisingly soundly defeated in few battles, most notably Battle of Aljubarrota in 1385, which (similar to battles of Crecy or Poitiers between English and French) featured much smaller Portuguese force using dismounted man-at-arms and archers in a prepared defensive position to destroy much larger enemy force. This victory sealed Portuguese independence and brought new dynasty to the throne: the house of Aviz which has strongly and securely ruled Portugal through the Age of Exploration. **House of Aviz and war of Castillian succession** During this period (15th and 16th century) house of Aviz was secure in Portugal helped with the wealth from Africa trade, and even in 1470s made a claim on Castilian throne. King Afonso V married his niece, who was one of the heirs of Castille, and opposed (future queen) Isabel and her husband Ferdinand II of Aragon. Battle of Toro decided the winner of the crown (Isabel). At the same time Castillians made an effort to take over the Portuguese African trade but were defeated on sea, which in turn sealed the control of Africa trade to Portuguese. In the following years, the kingdoms of Portugal, and now Spain (union of Castille and Aragon), were in rivalry, but not really \"threatening\" each other. The Treaty of Tordesillas separated the zones of influence of each nation which provided both with plenty of opportunities and area without actually coming into conflict. One of the potential hotspots was Moluccas (Spice islands), which could fall into both Portuguese and Spanish areas, but the nations resolved this issue with diplomacy (and payments) Spanish throne soon went to Habsburg dynasty which brought the Spanish involved in their various European conflicts most notably Netherlands and the rising Protestant issues. Still in 1520s, Portuguese king Jo\u00e3o III felt either envious or threatened by Emperor Charles V, and went to great deal of effort to organized a double marriage, where he married Charles V sister and Charles V married his sister, arranging peace for Portugal (btw In order to do so Jo\u00e3o paid a massive dowry to Charles, which might have severely weakened the Portuguese state according to some historians sending them on the downward spiral) **Finally the spanish invasion** After Jo\u00e3o's III death the Portuguese throne went to his grandson Sebastian. In 1578 Sebastian, young and foolish, personally led an expedition on Morocco where his army was defeated and he disappeared. Having no children the Portuguese throne went to Sebastian's grand-uncle Henry, who was also old and happened to be a cardinal in the church! The pope did not allow him to be released of his vows of celibacy (because of politics) so when he soon died the Portuguese throne was open. One of the claimants was Phillip II of Spain, as his mother was sister of Jo\u00e3o III. This was a good enough claim, not the best one, but more then enough, but he had some opposition in Portugal (which wasn't really unified) Spanish army destroyed the army of the rival claimant and was pronounced king of Portugal in 1580, under the conditions that the Portuguese kingdom remains independent from Spain, but under the same ruler, which was more or less honored under Philip II. So as you see, the Spanish **DID** in fact \"invade\" and take Portugal This new joint state: the **Iberian Union** controlled much of the New World as well as a lot of Europe, but suffered from consequences of such size and power. Various wars, like the Dutch War of Independence (80-years war) and then Thirty years war resulted in the Dutch taking over some of Portuguese outposts in Africa, Brazil and East Asia. **Restoration of Portugal** New king Philip III had financial problems because of these wars and raised the taxes and tried to incorporate Portugal under his central rule. This resulted with the Portuguese to declare independence in their Restoration War. Serious of Portuguese victories, general Spanish exhaustion from multiple wars and simultaneous Catalan Revolt led to Portuguese success and recognized independence by Spain in 1668. In the following years, both kingdoms Portugal and Spain where nowhere near the forces they used to be and remained generally respective to each other's status. **Summary** Spain in fact did try on several occasions to take over Portugal, as well as Portugal on some occasions trying to take over some of Spanish kingdoms.

This is actually exactly what I am looking at, especially comparing to acetylcholine which has a quaternary amine. The amino contributes to the formation of a pi-cationic interaction which is required for activation of the channel. This interaction is formed by the interaction of a cation and the negative quadrupole of an aromatic amino acid residue. In the case of the 5HT3 channel, this residue is Trytophan183 in binding loop B. Now, two things affect the strength of this pi-cationic interaction, 1 being the nature of the amine group (primary forms a stronger interaction than quaternary), and the precise location of the amine group. > Why does saturating it with carbon atoms affect the agonistic properties? This I am less sure about. If you have a specific example about what was modified and how I can better explain. How ever if the carbons are reducing the cationic properties of the amine group, then the pi-cationic interaction is weakened substantially.

{"original_text": "There are different types of treatment for childhood vascular tumors. Children with childhood vascular tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children. Some treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended. Eleven types of standard treatment are used: Betablocker therapy Surgery Photocoagulation Embolization Chemotherapy Sclerotherapy Radiation therapy Targeted therapy Immunotherapy Other drug therapy Observation New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Followup tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for childhood vascular tumors. Different types of treatment are available for children with vascular tumors. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Because vascular tumors in children are rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Children with childhood vascular tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children. Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists: Pediatric vascular anomaly specialist (expert in treating children with vascular tumors). Pediatric surgeon. Orthopedic surgeon. Radiation oncologist. Pediatric nurse specialist. Rehabilitation specialist. Psychologist. Social worker. Some treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended. Some treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after treatment has ended. These are called late effects. Late effects of treatment may include: Physical problems. Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory. Second cancers (new types of cancer). Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information). Eleven types of standard treatment are used: Betablocker therapy Betablockers are drugs that decrease blood pressure and heart rate. When used in patients with vascular tumors, betablockers may help shrink the tumors. Betablocker therapy may be given by vein (IV), by mouth, or placed on the skin (topical). The way the betablocker therapy is given depends on the type of vascular tumor and where the tumor first formed. The betablocker propranolol is usually the first treatment for hemangiomas. Infants treated with IV propranolol may need to have their treatment started in a hospital. Propranolol is also used to treat benign vascular tumor of liver and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma. Other betablockers used to treat vascular tumors include atenolol, nadolol, and timolol. Infantile hemangioma may also be treated with propranolol and steroid therapy or propranolol and topical betablocker therapy. See the drug information summary on Propranolol Hydrochloride for more information. Surgery The following types of surgery may be used to remove many types of vascular tumors: Excision: Surgery to remove the entire tumor and some of the healthy tissue around it. Laser surgery: A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a skin lesion such as a tumor. Surgery with a pulsed dye laser may be used for some hemangiomas. This type of laser uses a beam of light that targets blood vessels in the skin. The light is changed into heat and the blood vessels are destroyed without damaging nearby skin. Total hepatectomy and liver transplant: A surgical procedure to remove the entire liver followed by a transplant of a healthy liver from a donor. Curettage: A procedure in which abnormal tissue is removed using a small, spoonshaped instrument called a curette. The type of surgery used depends on the type of vascular tumor and where the tumor formed in the body. For malignant tumors, even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the tumor will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Photocoagulation Photocoagulation is the use of an intense beam of light, such as a laser, to seal off blood vessels or destroy tissue. It is used to treat pyogenic granuloma. Embolization Embolization is a procedure that uses particles, such as tiny gelatin sponges or beads, to block blood vessels in the liver. It may be used to treat some benign vascular tumors of the liver and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect tumor cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Chemotherapy for hemangiomas may also be given topically (applied to the skin in a cream or lotion). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the vascular tumor being treated. Sclerotherapy Sclerotherapy is a treatment used to destroy the blood vessel with the tumor. A liquid is injected into the blood vessel, causing it to scar and break down. Over time, the destroyed blood vessel is absorbed into normal tissue. The blood flows through nearby healthy veins instead. Sclerotherapy is used in the treatment of epithelioid hemangioma. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill tumor cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the tumor. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the tumor. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the vascular tumor being treated. External radiation is used to treat some vascular tumors. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific tumor cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Angiogenesis inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Angiogenesis inhibitors are drugs that stop cells from dividing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. The targeted therapy drugs thalidomide, sorafenib, pazopanib, sirolimus, and bevacizumab are angiogenesis inhibitors used to treat childhood vascular tumors. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight disease. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against disease. Interferon is a type of immunotherapy used to treat childhood vascular tumors. It interferes with the division of tumor cells and can slow tumor growth. It is used in the treatment of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Other drug therapy Other drugs used to treat childhood vascular tumors or manage their effects include the following: Steroid therapy: Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body. They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs. Steroid drugs help shrink some vascular tumors. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs are commonly used to decrease fever, swelling, pain, and redness. Examples of NSAIDs are aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. In the treatment of vascular tumors, NSAIDs can increase the flow of blood through the tumors and decrease the chance that an unwanted blood clot will form. Antifibrinolytic therapy: These drugs help the blood clot in patients who have KasabachMerritt syndrome. Fibrin is the main protein in a blood clot that helps stop bleeding and heal wounds. Some vascular tumors cause fibrin to break down and the patient's blood does not clot normally, causing uncontrolled bleeding. Antifibrinolytics help prevent the breakdown of fibrin. Observation Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way disease will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose tumors have not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop tumors from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials. Followup tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the vascular tumor may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the tumor has recurred (come back).

If you read through the accounts of early sailors, they often paper over the fact that neither side of the beach really understand the other, that there was little cross fluency. Generally speaking, that would have to wait until missionaries showed up and made a concerted effort to learn indigenous languages and at the same time gave indigenous peoples a chance to pick up English through more consistent exposure. In most trading relationships though, it\u2019s oftne the islander, who is more experienced with the languages of the foreign ships that come, than it is the crew of the ship with the language of the island. So while Davis and Young likely did learn some Hawaiian and other ali\u2019i who handled foreign trade did learn English, there were no fluent interlocutors at that moment\u2014 though over time fluency is developing on both sides."}

No electron exchange: Even if there was a reaction, there wouldn't be a significant exchange of electrons between the citric acid and copper, which is required for a noticeable impact on taste. 3.

When in low gravity, the body overcompensates and fluids pool in the upper body. It can take time to get rid of that effect when back on earth. Likewise, the body reacts to a person standing up or lying down by adjusting blood pressure. This reaction gets messed up in space, too. This might not be as much of a problem on Mars as it is in space, since Mars has much greater gravitational pull than there is in space."}

Something magnetic like iron would make it higher than air. L is the length, let's say we keep that constant. So that leaves N, the number of turns, and I, the current, as both being proportional. With N, doubling the number of turns would double the length of wire, which would double the amount of copper. So a proportional relation, twice as much copper, twice as much field strength. With I, it is a little more complicated. Doubling the amount of copper would double the cross sectional area. Doubling this would halve the resistance. The power, which let's say needs to stay constant to avoid overheating, is P = I^2 R. So if we halve R with twice the size of wire, that means I^2 can be twice as large. Which means I is only sqrt(2) times larger. So twice as much copper, only means a sqrt(2) increase in current and therefore only a sqrt(2) increase in field strength. This isn't quite the same overheating temperature limit though, as even with the same heat generation, we now have more mass to spread the heat over as well as more surface area to dissipate heat. In addition, the wire overheating is a little more complicated as they are all wrapped up together. But simplistically, more coils would be better. But there's yet more issues that may come into play: * I've assumed you can simply supply whatever current you need to reach the ampacity of the solenoid wires. Really, if you have a voltage source the resistance will determine your current. Too much lenth of a high gauge wire and you will get almost no current, few turns of a low gauge and you'll get a lot of current, but you'll be back to worrying about overheating or exceeding the capacity of your power supply. * Higher guage wire or mutiple layers of wires stacked will and at what factor you stack then push the current further out radially. While ideally the radius doesn't matter, realistically it does unless your solenoid is infinitely long. * The length also needs to come into play. It effects the total heating and beat dissipation, which is no simple matter. As well, a very short length with a very large amount of stacked turns would seem like the way to maximize the strength, but again that pushes more out radially and shortens the length making the formula less ideal and more dependent on radius. * Your limit for overheating is going to be very dependent on what your installation is. * If you stick a iron core inside, there is things to consider with regards to strength. * If you care about response time, there's even more considerations.

{"original_text": "This has to do with material properties, the way the glass is made and wear. Glass is a stiff and brittle material. Simply put this means that it takes a lot of stress to deform it but it takes little deformation to break it. Glass products are made by melting the glass and shaping it. As I'm sure you're aware, materials expand when heated and shrink when cooled. When glass products are cooled and become hard, stresses often remain as a result of uneven cooling. This effect can be minimized by slowly cooling the glass. Tempered glass however is cooled to get these internal stresses. The stresses are balanced, so that the glass is actually stronger than normal glass. All these internal stresses are what causes the entire solid of tempered glass to fracture into small pellets when broken. Finally, wear causes small surface cracks in the material. These are obviously weaknesses. So let's put it all together: When you touch the glass you transfer some extra stresses to it. When it was placed on the shelf, it had a different temperature and thus a different distribution of stresses and strains (because of thermal expansion). In it's cool state, the stresses and strains are, by random chance, unfavorably high in a small crack created by wear. The glass fractures without warning due to its brittle nature and the crack grows quickly to release all the stresses that have been in it since being tempered, effectively looking like an explosion.

In most adults, one shot is good for at least 5 years of protection. This vaccine often is recommended for: People who are 65 years old or older. People who have chronic (ongoing) diseases, serious longterm health problems, or weak immune systems.

People who have chronic (ongoing) diseases, serious longterm health problems, or weak immune systems. For example, this may include people who have cancer, HIV/AIDS, asthma, or damaged or removed spleens. People who smoke. Children who are younger than 5 years old. Children who are 518 years of age with certain medical conditions, such as heart or lung diseases or cancer. For more information, talk with your child's doctor. For more information about the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine, go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Vaccines and Preventable Diseases: Pneumococcal Vaccination Web page. Influenza Vaccine The vaccine that helps prevent the flu is good for 1 year. It's usually given in October or November, before peak flu season. Because many people get pneumonia after having the flu, this vaccine also helps prevent pneumonia. For more information about the influenza vaccine, go to the CDC's Vaccines and Preventable Diseases: Seasonal Influenza (Flu) Vaccination Web page. Hib Vaccine Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is a type of bacteria that can cause pneumonia and meningitis (meninJItis). (Meningitis is an infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord.) The Hib vaccine is given to children to help prevent these infections. The vaccine is recommended for all children in the United States who are younger than 5 years old. The vaccine often is given to infants starting at 2 months of age. For more information about the Hib vaccine, go to the CDC's Vaccines and Preventable Diseases: Hib Vaccination Web page. Other Ways To Help Prevent Pneumonia You also can take the following steps to help prevent pneumonia: Wash your hands with soap and water or alcoholbased rubs to kill germs. Don't smoke. Smoking damages your lungs' ability to filter out and defend against germs. For information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article. Although this resource focuses on heart health, it includes general information about how to quit smoking. Keep your immune system strong. Get plenty of rest and physical activity and follow a healthy diet. If you have pneumonia, limit contact with family and friends. Cover your nose and mouth while coughing or sneezing, and get rid of used tissues right away. These actions help keep the infection from spreading."}

Now imagine instead of a penny, you dropped an elevator car downwards. It would start out stationary like the penny, then drop in the same fashion.

From inside the car, it looks and feels like the penny is not subject to gravity.... but in reality it's just exactly as subject-to-gravity as the car is. To reproduce this effect in a plane, we can fly it to a safe altitude, aim it somewhat upwards, and then follow the path and speed it would take if it all the air suddenly disappeared.

Considering how the culture looks like, I would guess that there may have been historians like Herodotus even before the 5th century BCE there, even if the actual sources don't remain. There are a couple of people with such flaires on the subreddit though so you might want to PM them if you want answers for that part of the world as well."}

You can transfer any shares you get from into a stocks and shares component of an ISA without having to pay Capital Gains Tax - provided your ISA manager agrees to take them. The value of the shares at the date of transfer counts towards the annual limit. This means you can transfer up to \u00a311,520 worth of shares in the tax year 2013-14 (assuming that you make no other subscriptions to ISAs, in those years). You must transfer the shares within 90 days from the day they cease to be subject to the Plan, or (for approved SAYE share option schemes) 90 days of the exercise of option date. Your employer should be able to tell you more. Q. Can I put windfall or inherited shares in my ISA? A. No. You can only transfer shares you own into an ISA if they have come from an employee share scheme. Otherwise, the ISA manager must purchase shares on the open market.

{"original_text": "Is platelet storage pool deficiency inherited? Platelet storage pool deficiency refers to a group of conditions that can be acquired (noninherited) or inherited. Hereditary forms of the condition may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or Xlinked manner. In autosomal dominant conditions, one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause signs or symptoms of the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated copy of the gene from the affected parent. When a condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, a person must have a change in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. A condition is considered Xlinked if the mutated gene that causes the condition is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes (the Y chromosome is the other sex chromosome). Women have two X chromosomes and men have an X and a Y chromosome. Xlinked conditions can be Xlinked dominant or Xlinked recessive. The inheritance is Xlinked dominant if one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Women with an Xlinked dominant condition have a 50% chance of passing the condition on to a son or a daughter with each pregnancy. Men with an Xlinked dominant condition will pass the condition on to all of their daughters and none of their sons. The inheritance is Xlinked recessive if a gene on the X chromosome causes the condition in men with one gene mutation (they have only one X chromosome) and in females with two gene mutations (they have two X chromosomes). A woman with an Xlinked condition will pass the mutation on to all of her sons and daughters. This means that all of her sons will have the condition and all of her daughters will be carriers.

You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance Blindness Cataract Cerebellar vermis hypoplasia Decreased light and darkadapted electroretinogram amplitude Eye poking Fundus atrophy Intellectual disability Keratoconus Photophobia Pigmentary retinopathy Reduced visual acuity The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."}
{"original_text": "Glaciers move through three processes - creep, basal sliding and deformation of the underlying surface. Creep is where the ice flows like cookie dough. It is driven by gravity and pressure, so the deeper you go into a glacier, the faster the ice creeps. If the rate becomes too high, the glacier can suddenly crack and you end up with the glacier collapsing - this is common at the toe of a glacier in a fjord which is where icebergs are calved. Basal sliding relies on water being present under the ice. Pressure can melt ice and create a thin film of water which lubricates the sheet. Also, meltwater can find its way to the bottom of the sheet during summer months, increasing the ability of the ice to slide over the bedrock - so many glaciers accelerate during the summer months. Rough terrain under the ice sheet can also increase the rate of basal sliding as it allows areas of water to form between the ice and the rock which allow ice to zip along. Finally, if a glacier rolls over soft sediments, it can accelerate by deforming the sediments - they are so weak that they can be stretched and pulled by the moving ice. This is especially important if those sediments are waterlogged where they act just like the water that controls basal sliding. So you can imagine a glacier rolling down a mountain over different types of rock and different roughnesses of surface - parts of the glacier will be moving faster than others, some will actually be frozen to the rocks, others will be disintegrating because they are creeping so fast. Complex things. I'm sure a grown-up glaciologist will be along shortly to give a proper answer.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Glaciers move through three processes - creep, basal sliding and deformation of the underlying surface.

{"original_text": "/u/khosikulu has got it completely correct. Rhodes was not only well-known by the time of his death in 1902, but was widely idealised as the symbol of the British empire at the time. The editor of the *St. James Gazette*, Sidney Low, wrote that > A belief in Rhodes became a substitute for religion. That is pretty big talk, to compare Rhodes with organised religion especially during the Victorian-era of widespread and deeply ingrained Christianity. But Rhodes was well aware of the power of public relations and especially that the press had a large influence over the public agenda, and utilised it to his own ends. Perhaps the coverage of his death provides the most apt indicator of how he was percieved at the time, not only in South Africa and Rhodesia but also in England. Telegrams and cables from across the world were received by his mourning party, from leaders who both respected and detested him. The German Kaiser sent a message of sympathy to King Edward VII on the loss of so distinguished a subject as Mr. Rhodes. The American papers published longer obituaries than any since the death of Queen Victoria, except on the death of President McKinley. The English press went a little bit crazy with the jingoistic connotations, emphasising how much he had done for British imperialism and the destiny of those civilisations Britain had brought under its control. Queen Alexandra had a wreath made up with'From the Queen' on it, which lay on the coffin alongside wreaths from his brothers and sisters, as well as his very close friend Dr. Jim. A memorial service was held in St. Paul's Cathedral, attended by the Lord Mayor and the Corporation of the City of London. But you must remember that by this time, he was most widely esteemed in Southern Africa. 30,000 people went to view his casket at his house at Groote Schuur over the Easter weekend, with 15,000 more who went to the Parliament buildings to pay their respects. Despite the Boer War (and the necessity of an armoured train preceding his funeral carriage to his final resting place in the Matopos in what is now Zimbabwe) at every train station, there were crowds mourning and paying their last respect. Bunting, funeral ceremonies in every town, troops marking their respect, businesses shut, the Cape newspapers ran full-newspaper memorial editions. However, the perception of him at his death, and that of him during his life did vary. His death saw mass hysteria, racial delusion, mysticism and pageantry - as well as stage management of the entire situation! His'famous' last words,'So little done, so much to do' was a construction of Dr. Jims. When asked later, he stated > Nonesense! Do you think Rhodes was a poet? In reality, the English Establishment had never liked him - admittedly, they had collaborated when necessary, but he was always an outcast due to his Randlord status and the methods he used to achieve his imperial ambitions. To expand upon what /u/khosikulu has already mentioned, his actions after 1895 severely tarnished his reputation. By Christmas 1895, Rhodes was at the peak of his power and prestige, respected in Britain, and idealised by colonists throughout the world. In South Africa he had united English and Afrikaner, and his belief in a country from Cape Point to Lake Tanganyika seemed to be becoming a reality. By March 1896 the Cape Afrikaners had rebelled, the Ndebele had rebelled (and seen the white settlers of the region forced in to two heavily defended laagers inside Bulawayo and Gwelo), his Royal Charter was looking likely to be withdrawn, and the Jameson Raid had made him an embarrassment to the British imperial effort. Rhodes refused to acknowledge Jameson had done wrong and yet it was Rhodes decision to give power and authority to Jameson that had led to these catastrophes. The British public was well aware of these failings despite Rhodes efforts to hide behind the Cape Government and the other issues within South Africa. On top of the books /u/khosikulu named, there is a really easy biography by Antony Thomas called *Rhodes: The Race for Africa* which is very good for an all-round picture of the man and his life.

Also consider Martin Merediths *Diamonds, Gold, and War* because although not specifically about Rhodes, it mentions him a lot and puts him within the wider context of the time and region, and also shows the impact he had on Southern Africa as a whole.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "/u/khosikulu has got it completely correct. Rhodes was not only well-known by the time of his death in 1902, but was widely idealised as the symbol of the British empire at the time. The editor of the *St. James Gazette*, Sidney Low, wrote that > A belief in Rhodes became a substitute for religion. That is pretty big talk, to compare Rhodes with organised religion especially during the Victorian-era of widespread and deeply ingrained Christianity. But Rhodes was well aware of the power of public relations and especially that the press had a large influence over the public agenda, and utilised it to his own ends. Perhaps the coverage of his death provides the most apt indicator of how he was percieved at the time, not only in South Africa and Rhodesia but also in England. Telegrams and cables from across the world were received by his mourning party, from leaders who both respected and detested him. The German Kaiser sent a message of sympathy to King Edward VII on the loss of so distinguished a subject as Mr. Rhodes. The American papers published longer obituaries than any since the death of Queen Victoria, except on the death of President McKinley. The English press went a little bit crazy with the jingoistic connotations, emphasising how much he had done for British imperialism and the destiny of those civilisations Britain had brought under its control. Queen Alexandra had a wreath made up with'From the Queen' on it, which lay on the coffin alongside wreaths from his brothers and sisters, as well as his very close friend Dr. Jim. A memorial service was held in St. Paul's Cathedral, attended by the Lord Mayor and the Corporation of the City of London. But you must remember that by this time, he was most widely esteemed in Southern Africa. 30,000 people went to view his casket at his house at Groote Schuur over the Easter weekend, with 15,000 more who went to the Parliament buildings to pay their respects. Despite the Boer War (and the necessity of an armoured train preceding his funeral carriage to his final resting place in the Matopos in what is now Zimbabwe) at every train station, there were crowds mourning and paying their last respect. Bunting, funeral ceremonies in every town, troops marking their respect, businesses shut, the Cape newspapers ran full-newspaper memorial editions. However, the perception of him at his death, and that of him during his life did vary. His death saw mass hysteria, racial delusion, mysticism and pageantry - as well as stage management of the entire situation! His'famous' last words,'So little done, so much to do' was a construction of Dr. Jims. When asked later, he stated > Nonesense! Do you think Rhodes was a poet? In reality, the English Establishment had never liked him - admittedly, they had collaborated when necessary, but he was always an outcast due to his Randlord status and the methods he used to achieve his imperial ambitions. To expand upon what /u/khosikulu has already mentioned, his actions after 1895 severely tarnished his reputation. By Christmas 1895, Rhodes was at the peak of his power and prestige, respected in Britain, and idealised by colonists throughout the world. In South Africa he had united English and Afrikaner, and his belief in a country from Cape Point to Lake Tanganyika seemed to be becoming a reality. By March 1896 the Cape Afrikaners had rebelled, the Ndebele had rebelled (and seen the white settlers of the region forced in to two heavily defended laagers inside Bulawayo and Gwelo), his Royal Charter was looking likely to be withdrawn, and the Jameson Raid had made him an embarrassment to the British imperial effort. Rhodes refused to acknowledge Jameson had done wrong and yet it was Rhodes decision to give power and authority to Jameson that had led to these catastrophes. The British public was well aware of these failings despite Rhodes efforts to hide behind the Cape Government and the other issues within South Africa.

Changes (mutations) in the CTNNB1 gene are found in at least 75% of isolated (without other signs and symptoms) pilomatrixomas.

When the gene is not working properly, it can result in abnormal cell growth.

The force due to gravity is: F_g = m g = \u03c1.x.y.h.g = \u03c1.g.V The net force on the object is then: F_n = \u03c1w.g.V - \u03c1.g.V = g.V (\u03c1w - \u03c1) So if the density of the object is greater than that of water, the net force is downwards (i.e. it is negative) and the object sinks. If the density of the object is less than water, the net force is upwards and the object rises."}

{"original_text": "The mid-1990s Britpop phenomenon was an explicitly retro, and explicitly British, phenomenon which specifically looked back at the 1960s era of Swinging London as a kind of golden age (and a period, of course, when members of Blur and Oasis were infants or as yet unborn - Noel Gallagher was born in 1967, Damon Albarn in 1968). This perhaps becomes even more obvious when contrasted with some of the other British music forms of the era - the electronica of the Prodigy and the Chemical Brothers, or the trip-hop of Massive Attack and Portishead, or the jungle and drum & bass scenes that birthed the likes of Goldie and Roni Size - all of which were futurist in focus and distinctively putting a British spin on American music, and much of which was more multiethnic than Britpop. Oasis certainly did not hide their Beatlemania, and Blur\u2019s debt to 1960s British groups like the Small Faces and The Kinks was fairly clear (both bands also had more modern influences, but the Sixties influence was particularly blatant). And the Blur vs Oasis thing pushed by the music magazines was fairly obviously also a knowing analogue to the Beatles vs Stones rivalry of the 1960s. Because, yes, there absolutely was a very well-known \u2018Beatles vs Stones\u2019 rivalry in the 1960s, which music magazines and publicity people pushed, which painted the Rolling Stones as the bad working class boys and the Beatles as nice and middle-class. The truth was more complicated. The Beatles were from a Northern port town, Liverpool, and the Stones were from London, closer to the centre of power and influence. The Beatles largely came from very working class backgrounds; their drummer Ringo Starr in particular grew up in the Dingle, one of the poorest areas of Liverpool. George Harrison and Paul McCartney, too, grew up in government housing with parents with working class occupations; George Harrison\u2019s father was a bus driver, while Paul McCartney\u2019s father was basically a delivery man in the cotton trade (and his mother was a nurse). John Lennon was largely raised by his Aunt Mimi and Uncle George; Uncle George\u2019s family had owned and operated dairy farms, and they had means; if you do a Beatles tour in Liverpool, you\u2019ll see that John \u2018Working Class Hero\u2019 Lennon very clearly had the most middle-class upbringing of the Beatles; the house he grew up in is *much* nicer looking. Some of the Rolling Stones had quite middle-class upbringings. Brian Jones\u2019s father was an aeronautical engineer, while Mick Jagger was the son of teachers and became a student at the London School of Economics. Keith Richards\u2019 grandmother had been a Mayor. Other members of the group had more working-class backgrounds, sons of factory workers or truck drivers. Early pictures of the Beatles as a group - i.e., the famous ones of the Beatles in Hamburg taken by Astrid Kirchherr - show a group whose style of dress is jeans and leather, with slicked back hair - a \u2018bad boy\u2019 rock\u2019n\u2019roll image in the context of the times. Reports about their Hamburg shows also suggest the group played up to that image, with a fairly chaotic stage show, led by a group leader, John Lennon, with a penchant for the controversial and outrageous, for stirring up their German clientele. But at the point they returned to Liverpool and got the attention of Brian Epstein, the owner of NEMS (the biggest record store in Liverpool at the time), who offered to manage them, the Beatles\u2019 image changed. Epstein was convinced that the Beatles needed a much more professional image to become successful in the U.K. in 1962-1963, and he convinced the group that they had to wear chic tailored suits. It was wearing the suits that they became famous both in the U.K. and in the U.S.; part of their early success was partly because their fresh, professional face offset the fairly raw hard-edged throwback rock\u2019n\u2019roll they were making in the context of 1962-1963, a time when, according to one Decca record executive who famously told Brian Epstein that he was declining to sign the Beatles, rock\u2019n\u2019roll groups were on the way out. After the phenomenal success of the Beatles first in the U.K. in 1963 and in the U.K. in 1964., there was suddenly a larger space in pop culture for rock\u2019n\u2019roll bands - they were the new norm. The Rolling Stones, in contrast to the Beatles, were effectively blues purists fascinated with Chicago blues in particular, who had come from a jazz background (Charlie Watts, the Rolling Stones\u2019 drummer, still prefers jazz to rock). The Chicago blues of the likes of Muddy Waters or Howlin\u2019 Wolf has a particular sullen, defiant masculinity which the Rolling Stones attempted to emulate, and the Rolling Stones\u2019 manager Andrew Loog Oldham, and their record company (Decca, who had recently told Epstein that rock\u2019n\u2019roll was in its way out) marketed the Rolling Stones as an edgier Beatles. Initially in public appearances, the Rolling Stones took the Beatles\u2019 lead and wore suits, but Oldham had the idea that where the Beatles were family friendly, the kind of band that might cheekily ask royalty to rattle their jewellery, the Stones should be \u2018the band your parents love to hate\u2019. This wasn\u2019t necessarily true to life; Sean O\u2019Mahony, publisher of both band\u2019s official fan magazines, is quoted as saying \u2018the Beatles were thugs who were put across as nice blokes, while the Rolling Stones were gentlemen who were made into thugs [by Andrew Loog Oldham]\u2019. But the Rolling Stones stopped wearing suits, and grew their hair longer than the Beatles - and once the Rolling Stones grew confident in their songwriting ability - wrote songs with less melodic skill but more masculine-focused themes, further forming the band\u2019s image (some of their more misogynistic lyrics of the mid-1960s are perhaps best seen as playing to their stereotype). The Rolling Stones became, effectively, the second most popular British band by carving out that \u2018band your parents love to hate\u2019 niche; *Melody Maker* - one of the biggest U.K. magazines of the age - used headlines like \u2018Would You Let Your Sister Go a With A Rolling Stone\u2019. and so \u2018the Beatles or the Stones?\u2019 became a talking point of the age. There was a distinct gender difference in the group\u2019s fandoms; where the Beatles had a significant female following, the Rolling Stones\u2019 following was more masculine. The Rolling Stones became seen as working class in attitude, the Beatles as middle class in attitude - both had long hair and rebellious attitudes, but the Rolling Stones had longer hair - *gasp* - and were sullen where the Beatles were cheeky. Remember too, that this difference in attitudes towards The Beatles and The Stones comes down to some very British attitudes about \u2018working class\u2019 and \u2018middle class\u2019 and what those terms represent to different people; as John Lennon later claiming in song to be a working class hero suggests, there are some complicated politics behind what the working class represents (and what the middle class represents) to each other and to themselves. The focus on authenticity that would prize a Stones over a Beatles is itself something of a middle-class attitude; working class attitudes towards music are often suggested to be more functional - can I dance to it? - but both broader classes as always contain a variety of different ways of interacting with pop culture. These British attitudes about class, at the time, were complicated to explain to Americans who had very different attitudes towards class (the Rolling Stones in the context of 1960s American Anglophilia - where \u2018I\u2019m Henery The Eighth I Am\u2019 by Herman\u2019s Hermits was a hit where it was received more with groans in England - played up the louche aristocracy thing a bit more). On the other hand, the nice boy vs. bad boy thing is perhaps more universal. In terms of actual rivalry - unlike Blur and Oasis, where members of the bands genuinely despised each other - the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were generally friendly with each other by all accounts - after all, this was another band who *got it*, who understood where they were coming from, and who they could commiserate about the insanity of being a 1960s rock star with. But they were also competitive, trying to outdo each other musically (more than one person noticed a pattern of the Rolling Stones following the Beatles\u2019 progression through styles, something most obvious with the *Their Satanic Majesties Request*, the Stones\u2019 unsuccessful equivalent to *Sgt. Peppers*. If I remember correctly, George Harrison who had suggested to Decca that they should check out the Rolling Stones (who eventually signed to Decca). John Lennon was happy to be a part of the Rolling Stones\u2019 *Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Circus*. Jagger and Richards appear in the live broadcast of the Beatles\u2019 \u2018All You Need Is Love\u2019, while Lennon and McCartney sung backing vocals on Rolling Stones\u2019 equivalent single \u2018We Love You\u2019, and of course gave the Rolling Stones an early hit with their song \u2018I Wanna Be Your Man\u2019. And one of the most revealing things that Mick Jagger has ever said on tape is when interviewed by the makers of the *Rutles* documentary ~1977-1978, discussing the Beatles through a thin veil of discussing the mockumentary parody of the band, The Rutles; in that, Jagger discusses being present when the ~~Beatles~~ Rutles play ~~Shea Stadium~~ Che Stadium, which the Rutles doco narrator explains is named after the Cuban guerilla leader, Che Stadium. Jagger talks about the strangeness of the whole thing, and is very amused to let slip just how many girls were backstage, and what exactly the ~~Beatles~~Rutles were about to do to them in plain sight, apparently at once. What\u2019s revealing about this, beyond Jagger\u2019s irreverentness, is that he was clearly enough of an insider to be trusted to witness such Beatles depravity (and perhaps that they might have even been attempting to show off to one of their competitors, assuming the thinly disguised story is true).", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "The mid-1990s Britpop phenomenon was an explicitly retro, and explicitly British, phenomenon which specifically looked back at the 1960s era of Swinging London as a kind of golden age (and a period, of course, when members of Blur and Oasis were infants or as yet unborn - Noel Gallagher was born in 1967, Damon Albarn in 1968).

{"original_text": "Don't know what you mean by the back of your tongue, I just put a fresh 9V all over my tongue and I was able to feel it everywhere (and weakly on the inside of my cheeks). But as to why you feel it so well on your tongue relative to the rest of your body? The answer is because of two factors 1) It is a low electrical resistance pathway, and 2) the location of nerve endings. Think of a 9V battery as a pump, it can supply a certain \"pressure\" of electricity. However, just like something that pumps water, if you try and make it pump through a high resistance pathway (equivalent to a small pipe) it wont pump much electricity (water). So your tongue, because it is wet and salty, and doesn't have a thick coating of dead skin cells, is low resistance, and this allows the considerably more current to flow than across your skin. While it is often said that \"current excites neurons/muscles\" this isn't 100% true. But for this explanation, we can accept it. So the more current, the more neurons will get excited. You can imagine a small volume of current flowing in your tissue where there is enough current to excite neurons. This is where the second point comes in. There needs to be enough nerve endings near the surface of the tissue. If there are few nerve endings, you wont feel much. Or if the nerve endings are deep, you wont feel much. So the tongue ticks all the boxes, it is low resistance (so lots of current), there are lots of nerve endings, and those nerve endings are close to the surface.

You can imagine a small volume of current flowing in your tissue where there is enough current to excite neurons. This is where the second point comes in. There needs to be enough nerve endings near the surface of the tissue. If there are few nerve endings, you wont feel much. Or if the nerve endings are deep, you wont feel much. So the tongue ticks all the boxes, it is low resistance (so lots of current), there are lots of nerve endings, and those nerve endings are close to the surface. FYI: If you were to sink two hypodermic needles into the tips of your fingers, and place 9V across them, you would feel it."}

Keep in mind that this may change from place to place, since not every country has the same rules.

You are correct; as far as I know, there is no equivalent to \u201cGilded Age\u201d in Latin American nomenclature. To my knowledge, no historians have made the argument that the late 19th century was a gilded age, and the name \u201cedad dorada\u201d refers only to the United States. However, the characteristics that Mark Twain used to describe the Gilded Age in the United States, namely excessive, wasteful wealth that only benefitted some at the expense of others, is arguably more fitting when used to describe the Southern Cone. During the second half of the 19th century, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay finally put the wars of independence and civil wars behind them. At long last, Argentina and Uruguay crystallized into nation-states. Stable democracies took shape in all three nations that became more and more inclusive over time (with exceptions of course). The economies of all three nations took off, supporting the Industrial Revolution in far away nations with their raw materials. Wool, hides, flax, and grain from the Pampas and minerals like nitrates drastically improved terms of trade. According to Michael Johns in his article \u201cIndustrial Capital and Economic Development in Turn of the Century Argentina,\u201d the Argentine economy alone \u201cgrew at an annual rate of five percent; experienced a ten-fold increase in foreign trade; became home to over three million immigrants from southern Europe; and absorbed foreign investments that increased from 132 million gold pesos in 1875 to 2,835 million by 1913\u201d (p. 188). By the end of the 19th century, according to Jose Moya in *The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History*, Argentina and Uruguay \u201cboasted the highest levels of international trade per capita in the world and ranked among the ten richest countries\u201d (p. 11). Chile wasn\u2019t far outside the top ten. All three nations also stood near the top of the \u201cmost urbanized\u201d list. Chile controlled the southern tip of South America, and Valpara\u00edso was a world-class port in a critical location. Railroads crossed the Pampas and the Banda Oriental and connected previously isolated communities, tying them to the central hubs of Buenos Aires and Montevideo respectively. Valpara\u00edso, Santiago, Buenos Aires, and Montevideo were ranked alongside European cities in terms of development. Uruguay is considered one of the world\u2019s first welfare states, providing a safety net for many of its citizens, limiting work hours per week, and instituting extensive social reforms. To outsiders, all of this economic expansion was impressive. They optimistically called Argentina, for example, the \u201cUnited States of South America\u201d and Buenos Aires \u201cthe Paris of South America.\u201d Yet this \u201cgolden age\u201d was not nearly as rosy as one might expect. For example, economic expansion on the frontiers came at the expense of indigenous peoples, who were violently exterminated in the *conquista del desierto* campaign in Argentina and the pacification of the Araucan\u00eda in south central Chile. The nitrate boom came at the expense of Bolivia and Peru, who lost territory following their defeat in the War of the Pacific. To make matters worse for locals, foreigners often provided the capital to develop infrastructure during this period or signed deals which granted them monopolies over natural resources. Huge amounts of money left the countries as a result and led to the rise of the \u201cdependency theory.\u201d Though in recent years there has been a reexamination of this theory, certainly a lot of foreigners made excellent investments and sizable profits. But rarely did this wealth remain in the Southern Cone. At the same time, Jeffrey Williamson, in his recent book *Trade and Poverty: When the Third World Fell Behind*, argues that the gains from globalization at the turn of the century benefited the core of the nations but did not spread to the peripheries. This led to the de-diversification of many Latin American economies. As a result, life for the gauchos of Argentina and Uruguay remained largely the same as it had always been. Immigrants struggled to escape the *conventillos* of Buenos Aires (out of which the famous tango would spring, as the poor tried to forget their suffering). Poor houses sprang up in Montevideo and Santiago. Wealth remained highly concentrated in Buenos Aires, Montevideo, and the central valley of Chile. Expansion benefited the wealthy elite more than the average farmer or rancher. Michael Reid in his book *Forgotten Continent: The Battle for Latin America\u2019s Soul* points out that \u201cthe Pampas had been divided up very unequally: according to the 1914 census, the largest 584 farms occupied almost a fifth of the total area, and those of over 1,000 hectares (2,470 acres) more than 60 per cent. The mean average landholding in Argentina was 890 acres, compared with 175 acres in New South Wales and 130 acres in the United States\u201d (p. 87). The same can be said of Chile\u2019s landed elite, who dominated the central valley and controlled most of the nation\u2019s mineral wealth. Though there was some \u201ctrickle down\u201d as it later became known, a huge gap opened between the wealthiest and the poorest sections of society.

Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Endometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the endometrium. The endometrium is the lining of the uterus, a hollow, muscular organ in a womans pelvis. The uterus is where a fetus grows. In most nonpregnant women, the uterus is about 3 inches long. The lower, narrow end of the uterus is the cervix, which leads to the vagina. Cancer of the endometrium is different from cancer of the muscle of the uterus, which is called sarcoma of the uterus. See the PDQ summary on Uterine Sarcoma Treatment for more information about uterine sarcoma. Obesity and having metabolic syndrome may increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for endometrial cancer include the following: Having endometrial hyperplasia. Being obese. Having metabolic syndrome, a set of conditions that occur together, including extra fat around the abdomen, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high levels of triglycerides and low levels of highdensity lipoproteins in the blood. Never giving birth. Beginning menstruation at an early age. Reaching menopause at an older age. Having polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Having a mother, sister, or daughter with uterine cancer. Having a certain gene change that is linked to Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer). Having hyperinsulinemia (high levels of insulin in the blood). Taking tamoxifen for breast cancer or taking estrogen alone (without progesterone) can increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer may develop in breast cancer patients who have been treated with tamoxifen. A patient who takes this drug and has abnormal vaginal bleeding should have a followup exam and a biopsy of the endometrial lining if needed. Women taking estrogen (a hormone that can affect the growth of some cancers) alone also have an increased risk of endometrial cancer.

So you would then have a bit of the mark left over after your DNA replicates, from the histones that were present before replication, and those would be inserted back into the DNA alongside new histones. There are mechanisms to distinguish the new histones by their modifications, and the \"old\" histones still carrying the proper marks would recruit factors that copy their mark to nearby \"new\" histones.

{"original_text": "What are the signs and symptoms of Hypoplastic left heart syndrome? Normally, oxygenpoor blood is pumped through the right side of the heart to the lungs, where it gains oxygen and returns to the left side of the heart. The oxygenrich blood is then pumped from the left side of the heart to the rest of the body. At birth, all babies also have two connections, or shunts, between the two sides of the heart; however, within a few days of birth these connections close. In those with HLHS, the underdeveloped left side of the heart is unable to provide enough blood flow to the body. The normal shunts present at birth help to direct blood to the body; when these connections close the oxygenrich blood supply decreases. At first, a newborn with HLHS may appear normal. Symptoms usually occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. These symptoms may include: Bluish (cyanosis) or poor skin color Cold hands and feet (extremities) Lethargy Poor pulse Poor suckling and feeding Pounding heart Rapid breathing Shortness of breath In healthy newborns, bluish color in the hands and feet is a response to cold (this reaction is called peripheral cyanosis). However, a bluish color in the chest or abdomen, lips, and tongue is abnormal (called central cyanosis). It is a sign that there is not enough oxygen in the blood. Central cyanosis often increases with crying. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

{"original_text": "> When and if the Graviton is ever discovered what would that prove? Right now, low-energy quantum gravity can be described using the effective quantum field theory (QFT) of gravitons. This gives general relativity in the classical limit, and in addition it gives some interesting new predictions like Hawking radiation. Unfortunately, the theory only works away from strong curvature (black hole singularities, the big bang), while the corrections at energies we can access are *extremely* small. For example, you can calculate the correction to Einstein's calculation of the perihelion shift of Mercury, and find that the quantum correction is something like 10^90 times smaller than the correction Einstein calculated. So it seems unlikely that we would ever detect individual gravitons. Now, this effective QFT seems to be pretty much the unique description of low-energy gravity, so if anything, it would be extremely surprising if gravitons did **not** exist. It would mean that quantum gravity is already not understood at low energies, and we would need to throw out a lot of our understanding. Especially now that we are sure there are gravitational waves, which should be modeled quantum mechanically as coherent states of gravitons. So discovering a graviton would really just confirm how we expect low-energy gravity to work. (Maybe I should stress again that this is all at low-energies; at high energies the theory likely looks nothing like gravitons at all). > and what would be its utility? Nothing as far as I know. But I can't even imagine how how we would ever detect or discover a graviton in the first place, let alone conceive of applications.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "> When and if the Graviton is ever discovered what would that prove?

So this means that when dealing with peoples such as the Amalekites, we have to be rather careful. Looking first at possible archeological remains, we have limited data. Beno Rothenberg, in Negeb, Archeology in the Negev and the Aravah, suggested that some of the smaller settlements in the Negev highlands may be attached to the Amalekites.

But in 2003, he wrote an article titled Egyptian chariots, Midianites from Hijaz/Midian (Northwest Arabia) and Amalekites from the Negev in the Timna Mines. In particular interest here is the treatment of rock art that Rothenberg attributes to the Amalekites.

So what individuals like Herzog and Rothenberg are arguing is that we have distinct group of people, settling in the areas that the Biblical tradition states, at the time they say it was happening, and generally doing what the Biblical record is saying, according to the archeological record. While the archeological record does not flesh out the name Amalekite, it isn't a necessity as the evidence we have suggests that is who they are.

What made the loss of Varus' legions so [potentially] disastrous was that those 3 legions were the defenders between the Germanians and the civilians in the Roman empire. The loss of those legions would not have been as bad if it had happened 40 years earlier, before Augustus reduced the number of legions in the empire to less than half of what it was after Actium. As it stood in 9 AD, the Germanians could easily have walked quite far down south if they had had that desire. It's usually stated that the road to Rome lay free, but that's assuming the Romans wouldn't have mobilized other legions, so it's a bit misinformative. The loss at Carrhae was arguable less bad than both Cannae and the Teotoburger forest, but it was hardly negligable. Before Caesar was killed he planned a revenge campaign against the Partians for that loss, but it was never executed because of the civil war that followed Caesar's assassination. What that means to us is that it took almost two additional generations for Rome to gain control^1 over the Levant. So comes Cannae. The Second Punic war was extremely costly for Rome, especially during the first few years. Keep in mind that Cannae was just the end event of a series of battles. The Romans actually lost full legions a few times from the battle of Trebia and down through the Italic peninsula before they finally gathered a massive force (estimated to have been around 70.000 men) to beat down Hannibal completely. At this time (216 BCE) the city of Rome had roughly 250.000 inhabitants, but the army gathered was of course not just Romans, but also allies from various cities on the peninsula. As I'm sure you're aware, the Romans lost the battle and it was a truly crushing defeat. Even discounting the 10-15.000 soldiers that followed Varro away from the battle, the Romans lost roughly 50.000 soldiers in that one day. If you count in percentages (not really academic, but gives a clearer picture of just how bad that was), that's arguably the worst single day in European history, and without doubt in ancient times. What followed the battle was a complete turn-around in Roman tactics. However, not to be dismissed is that ~~Hannibal actually marched on Rome after Cannae and besieged it~~,^2 but realised that his army was too beaten to actually launch an attack on the city with the population ready to defend at all costs inside the gates. Anyway, after Cannae the Romans avoided a direct confrontation with Hannibal at all costs for over a decade and it would take generations for the male population on the Italic peninsula to recover from the disaster.
