{"original_text": "\"Lenny\" is a captivating biographical drama that delves into the complex life of one of America's most influential comedians and social commentators, Lenny Bruce. Directed by Bob Fosse, this film provides a raw and unapologetic portrayal of Bruce's rise to fame, his battles with censorship, and the personal demons that ultimately led to his tragic downfall. Dustin Hoffman delivers a tour-de-force performance as Lenny Bruce, perfectly capturing the comedian's wit, vulnerability, and relentless pursuit of truth. Hoffman's commitment to the role is commendable, as he flawlessly emulates Bruce's mannerisms and distinctive voice, immersing viewers in the world of this enigmatic figure. Fosse's direction is masterful, employing a non-linear narrative that jumps between Bruce's stand-up performances, court trials, and personal life. This fragmented structure adds depth to the storytelling, allowing us to witness the evolution of Bruce's controversial material and the impact it had on society. The film tackles important themes such as freedom of speech, censorship, and the power of comedy to challenge societal norms. It forces viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about the price one pays for pushing boundaries and speaking truth to power. \"Lenny\" is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged film that not only celebrates the legacy of Lenny Bruce but also serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of stifling artistic expression. With its stellar performances, impeccable direction, and poignant storytelling, this film is a must-watch for anyone interested in the intersection of comedy and social commentary.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 0, "text": "\"Lenny\" is a captivating biographical drama that delves into the complex life of one of America's most influential comedians and social commentators, Lenny Bruce.

The menu isn't extensive, but it's got a good amount of inexpensive sandwiches, salads, and soups. Their Cuban Sandwich ($10 w/ side) was pretty excellent. The bread wasn't the traditional panini-style, but a French baguette...it was still great and had a little crispness to it. All the main ingredients (meat, mustard, pickles, cheese) were in good balance. As a Florida boy who loves his Cuban sandwiches, I would definitely recommend this. I also tried a bit of their Royal Grille, a grilled-chese sandwich with several cheeses, as well as apple slices, on whole grain wheat bread ($8.50 w/ side, extra to add ham/turkey). It was damn good and hit the grilled cheese craving just right. A side salad was also done well. For my side, I chose their \"spicy carrots\" which sounded unique. It consists of sliced raw carrots that have been marinated in a tangy dressing with crushed red pepper, served in a cup. The carrots were cold and crisp and the flavors were fantastic. The spice was just enough to be pleasant. I would definitely get these again. Our food came out super quick and our service was great.

It follows the typical underdog story, where an inexperienced protagonist faces off against a more skilled opponent. This formula has been seen countless times before, making it difficult for the movie to truly stand out. Additionally, the characters, although well-acted, lack depth and complexity. The protagonist, Dre, played by Jaden Smith, does a decent job portraying a determined young boy, but his character development feels limited. Similarly, the antagonist, Cheng, comes across as a stereotypical bully with no significant backstory or motivations. Furthermore, the film's pacing feels uneven, particularly during the training sequences.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "\"The Karate Kid\" is one of the most well-known martial arts films of all time, but it lacks the originality and depth of the original film, which made its debut in 1984.\" The film, starring Jaden Smith and Ralph Macchio, tells the story of a young boy, Dre, who trains to become a karate master."}

When I heard \"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue\" was in the works, I thought it could be better. But when I saw a pic of how Scooby and Shaggy were going to appear, I knew this show was going to be bad, if not worse. I watched a few episodes, and believe me, it is just yet another \"Teen Titans\" or \"Loonatics Unleashed\"-wannabe. No longer are Scooby and Shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool, creepy monsters that rob banks. Now they are going after a typical super-villain whom wants to destroy the world. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo have become more brave, too. Also, since Shaggy IS NOT going to be a vegetarian in this series, Casey Kasem (whom actually IS a vegetarian), the original voice of Shaggy, will NOT voice Shaggy. He will only voice Shaggy if he doesn't eat meat, and that was just a stupid corporate-done change to update the franchise, as if the Internet jokes weren't enough. So Scott Menville (whom previously voiced Red Herring on \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\") voices Shaggy here. Believe me, the voice is REALLY BAD! It makes Shaggy sound like a squeaky 10-year-old, and I must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look. However, Kasem DOES voice Shaggy's Uncle Albert, which is a sort of good thing. Scooby-Doo, on the other hand, does not look that well. He seems to have been designed to look more like the CGI Scooby-Doo from the live-action movies. Also, Scooby's Frank Welker voice (need I mention Brain the Dog again?) still hasn't improved. Robi, the robotic butler, is practically worse than Scrappy-Doo! He tries to be funny and does \"comical\" impressions and gives safety tips (\"Remember kids, don't stand under trees during a thunderstorm!\"), but it just doesn't fit into a Scooby-Doo cartoon. Again, the Hanna-Barbera sound effects are rarely used here. However, on one episode, \"Lightning Strikes Twice,\" they use the \"Castle thunder\" thunderclaps during it, almost extensively! (Although they DO still use the newly-recorded thunder sound effects, too.) Scooby-Doo hasn't use \"Castle thunder\" sound effects since 1991. But my question is, why use \"Castle thunder\" on \"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue,\" while NOT use it on the direct-to-video movies or even on \"What's New Scooby-Doo!\" (Two episodes of WNSD used it, and it wasn't enough, unfortunately.)

We just moved to Dunedin and have been to many spots on Main Street (Living Room, Casa Tina, Black Pearl, Pisces, Bon Appetite, Sea Sea Riders) and had great food and fun. We got there around noon and it was busy. The hostess was sort of confusing but we told her table for two inside. She gave us a pager and showed us to the bar. The bar seats were full so we sort of stood by the door. We were there around 10 minutes when another couple came in and checked in at the hostess stand and came into the bar to wait. About 20 minutes later I checked in at hostess stand and was surprised they were working off two waiting lists - I thought that was odd. The hostess told me not too much longer.

{"original_text": "Spoilers.....I saw the original on TV sometime ago and remembered this production as less gripping than most Beeb costume drama. I rewatched on DVD this week and still have the same impression of it. It's a good story at first, but weakens when the heroine becomes oh so terribly brave and noble and returns to her utterly vile husband when he's ill and I got so totally irritated with her saintliness. I suppose this was the \"right thing to do\" when the story was written as well as contributing plenty of angst, and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband as marriage made her no more than his possession, let alone to carry on scandalously with a lover as I expect a lot of the modern audience would have liked to see. But it's hard to take the santimoniousness nowadays and especially when this heroine had a strong, brave admirer ready to defend her against anyone and everyone. So re the story as in the film I'm equivocal. It's well done as per the novel, but somewhat irritating as per today's kind of life.Steadfast hero Gilbert was certainly a saint to put up with his ladylove's variable and often cryptic behaviour and persistent self-denial and to be so consistently supportive. So I felt it a great shame that when Helen was at long last free to be with him, the script didn't allow him a bit more than about one minute to fall on each other for a quick hug before the titles came up. This was completely ridiculous when we'd been waiting all this time through all that dripping sentiment over the undeserving husband for a decent bit of dialogue and a good embrace between hero and heroine. Instead, the ending was as though the film makers had run out of time or finance or just couldn't be bothered. \"Here you are - one minute, do what you can in that, then cut as the director wants to go home now.....\" I was left feeling totally dissasatisfied.However, very high commendations to the acting of Toby Stephens a perfect and very handsome hero, and Rupert Graves a superbly nasty and self-pitying villain. Tara Fitzgerald was satisfactory within the confines of the script that forced her to be a depressing and rather sanctimonious victim so much of the time.That said, I love these classic dramas and virtually all of them are a sight better than much of the \"modern\" drama on TV these days.

{"original_text": "So on the Chills Network on cable they are having \"Vampire Month\", I'm such a dork, but I love vampires. So after a few duds that they showed I was pretty disappointed, but then I noticed Sleepwalkers was written by Stephen King. So I decided to go ahead and check it out, well much to my surprise, this movie was really bad. Most Stephen King films are entertaining and some are very scary. While Sleepwalkers was bad, it was a beautiful kind of bad. I had a good time laughing at this movie and just taking it for what it was. I've never read Sleepwalkers, from what I understand this is the only real vampire story by King, so I can't really compare book to film. I don't know if it was just my TV, but Sleepwalkers looked like it was made for TV. The special effects were corny and the story was a bit far fetched, even if it is fantasy, it had a lot of problems. Charles Brady and his mother Mary are vampires who feed off the life force of virgin women. They are considerably more resilient than humans and have powers of both telekinesis and illusion. Their one weakness is cats, who are not only able to see through their illusions but whose claws are capable of inflicting severe to fatal wounds upon them. They also maintain an incestuous relationship. Charles and Mary have taken up residence in a small Indiana town. Charles attends the local high school, and there he meets Tanya Robertson in his creative writing class. Tanya does not suspect the real reason why Charles wants her so much; to take her life force for his mother, who is starving. At first, it seems that Charles has fallen in love with Tanya. On their first date, however, a picnic at the nearby cemetery, Charles attempts to drain the life force from Tanya while kissing her. As it happens, Deputy Sheriff Andy Simpson who had earlier tried to pull Charles over for speeding, drives by the cemetery and notices Charles' car. When Tanya runs to him for help, Charles tracks Andy down and kills him. When Charles then turns to resume his life force-depleting make out session with Tanya, the deputy's cat, Clovis, rises to the occasion and nearly kills Charles by scratching him in the face and chest. Mortally wounded by Clovis, Charles staggers back home to Mary. Mary then seeks vengeance on Tanya's family.So to sum this movie up basically you should expect the cheese to overflow. The scene where Charles attacks Tanya for the first time is very clich\u00e9 and you almost vote for Charles to win just because Tanya is one of the dumbest female leads in horror movies. Then you gotta love the scene where Mary has a gun and shoots it at a cop car and somehow the whole thing explodes, God bless Hollywood explosions and exaggerations. I'm taking the movie for what it is, it's just so deliciously bad that it turns into a dark comedy for me that I could just enjoy making fun of.

{"original_text": "\"Scrooge\" takes the beloved classic tale of \"A Christmas Carol\" and infuses it with a fresh, modern twist that is both engaging and heartwarming. Director John Doe has masterfully brought to life the iconic character of Ebenezer Scrooge, played flawlessly by the incredibly talented John Smith. From the very beginning, the film captivates audiences with its stunning visuals and breathtaking cinematography. The attention to detail in the set design and costumes truly transports viewers to Victorian-era London, making them feel fully immersed in Scrooge's world. What truly sets this adaptation apart is its innovative approach to storytelling. Doe seamlessly blends traditional elements of the original story with contemporary twists, resulting in a narrative that is both familiar and excitingly unpredictable. The clever use of flashbacks and dream sequences adds an extra layer of depth to the already rich and compelling plot. But it is the performances that truly steal the show. John Smith's portrayal of Scrooge is nothing short of exceptional. He effortlessly transitions from the cold-hearted miser to a man filled with remorse and redemption, capturing the essence of the character's transformation with incredible nuance and emotional depth. The supporting cast, including Jane Doe as the Ghost of Christmas Past and Mark Johnson as Bob Cratchit, deliver equally compelling performances, adding further depth to the film.

The concept of an alien invasion and human manipulation through subliminal messages was intriguing, and I was excited to see how it would play out. However, as the movie progressed, I couldn't help but feel that something was missing. The pacing was inconsistent, with some scenes dragging on for far too long, while others felt rushed and underdeveloped. This made it difficult for me to fully invest in the story and its characters. Additionally, the acting, although decent, didn't quite live up to my expectations. While Roddy Piper's performance as the lead character, Nada, was solid, some of the supporting actors felt a bit wooden and lacked the depth needed to fully bring their roles to life. This, in turn, affected my ability to connect with them on an emotional level. Despite these shortcomings, I must admit that the film did have its moments.

After giving Pokemon the Movie one point, giving this movie one point seems like nothing short of charity. That's how bad it is. Did the producers and directors even take film classes? Because this is a perfect example of how not to make a film. It looks like some amateur high on paint thinner made this film. If you rented this, please take it back and ask for a refund. And don't even think about renting it again."}

Also had the beausoleil oyster with chopped cucumber and some kind of mignette- delightful and you can buy them individually so you don't have to get a full order like many places! The rose sour cocktail was right up my alley- slightly sweet and made with bubbles- how could I not like it? We also ordered the sorghum bacon- thick cut like pork belly- sweet sauce! Yummy!

This is the kind of funny and touching movie we are all looking for as a counterbalance to all the bombastic special effects bores.

And it has just enough of an edge to be a true indie find. Obviously this is a labor of love for Paul Reiser who understands what it's like to be both a father and a son, as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life. The most fun part, though, was watching Reiser watch Falk. You could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor really enjoying Peter Falk's special craft. Really delightful.

{"original_text": "I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best television sci-fi series made. Both stand out in my mind because unlike early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK:TNG, they were fine shows, but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes. In many ways, you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring. This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that took up all of the final season) and the other TREK shows, as there was more of a larger story that unified them. This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form. Sure, there were a few \"throwaway\" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny.And speaking of funny, I loved that SG-1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasn't so dreadfully serious. In this way, I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of Homer Simpson--it's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons.To truly appreciate SG-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work. This coherence gives the show exceptional staying power. And, if you don't like SG-1 after giving it a fair chance, then sci-fi is probably NOT the genre for you.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best television sci-fi series made.

The people who did perform well, were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez, and Christopher Walken, but their screen time just wasn't able to save the movie. There were a few scenes that jumped out in their originality, yet somehow it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer. A certain tune was used around 4 times, which really started to bug after the second time. I'm a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once.

The movie doesn't shy away from showing the devastating consequences of the characters' actions and the toll it takes on them both physically and emotionally. The plot revolves around a group of prisoners of war who are forced to play a football match against their Nazi captors. While the idea of a sports match bringing people together sounds uplifting, the film highlights the underlying tension, fear, and despair that permeate the atmosphere. The prisoners are constantly reminded of their dire situation, and their hope for freedom seems almost impossible. What makes the movie even more unsettling is the excellent portrayal of the characters. The actors give incredibly realistic performances, conveying the desperation and fear that the prisoners experience. Their expressions and body language reflect the mental and physical toll that war has taken on them, making it difficult to watch at times.

Usually it is the other way around; one reads the book and then wants to see the movie. I will definitely obtain a copy of the Susan Minot book and read it. The Rhode Island scenery is spectacular as is the soundtrack. Any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period automobiles. Needless to say now, but I recommend Evening highly. See it you will enjoy it."}

{"original_text": "\"Peter Pan\" is a timeless classic that effortlessly transports its readers to a world of magic and adventure. J.M. Barrie's enchanting tale follows the escapades of the mischievous Peter Pan, a boy who never ages, and his loyal companions: the Darling children\u2014Wendy, John, and Michael. Set in the whimsical world of Neverland, the narrative is filled with thrilling escapades, breathtaking encounters with pirates, and a sprinkle of pixie dust that allows the characters to fly. Barrie's masterful storytelling captivates readers of all ages, weaving together elements of fantasy, imagination, and coming-of-age. The vivid descriptions of Neverland's lush landscapes and mythical creatures ignite the reader's imagination, evoking a sense of childlike wonder and escapism. The character development is equally impressive, as we witness the Darling children's growth and transformation throughout their journey with Peter Pan. Beyond its adventurous facade, \"Peter Pan\" subtly explores themes of identity, the bittersweet nature of growing up, and the importance of cherishing one's inner child. It serves as a poignant reminder to embrace the fleeting moments of youth while acknowledging the inevitability of maturity. Barrie's writing style is whimsical and poetic, seamlessly blending humor and heart. The dialogue between characters is witty, and the interactions between Peter Pan and Captain Hook are particularly entertaining. The story effortlessly oscillates between moments of sheer excitement and poignant introspection, leaving readers both exhilarated and introspective. \"Peter Pan\" is a timeless classic that has endured for over a century, captivating generations with its magic, adventure, and profound messages. It remains a must-read for both children and adults, reminding us all to never lose sight of our inner child and the limitless possibilities of imagination and dreams.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 0, "text": "\"Peter Pan\" is a timeless classic that effortlessly transports its readers to a world of magic and adventure.

{"original_text": "This is a great movie. It has a captivating story, an awesome main character, very good acting and killer action. This takes place mostly in the year 2036 but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story.The story is very well done and there are no holes. Kurt Russell is a solider named Todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all of the other soldiers have never had normal lives. Eventually the military introduces newer, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. Jason Scott Lee being one of them. As a result they don't have any need for the old soldiers like Todd. They test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers, in the battle Russell is injured and assumed to be dead. The military dumps his body as well as a fewer others assuming they are all dead but what they don't realize is that Russell is alive.Todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him on. For a while he lives there but can't adjust to normal life. He rarely says a word and he is at times very aggressive towards the other people. When they feel he is a danger to them they send him off to the desert.Just as Russell's leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers. What the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like Todd and the other old soldiers. So while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd easily outsmarts them. The military starts realizing this and Todd kills all of their men but one. That one is Jason Scott Lee and in the end you see a classic fight scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell obviously comes out on top.This is one of the best action films I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. This has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines. The writer also didn't forget that Russell had never seen a woman before as he calls even women \"sir\".

{"original_text": "I Am Curious is really two films in one - half of it is the sexual experimental side of Lena and the other half is her curiosity with political/socialism.

There is a bizarre mixture of political/war rallies, Dr. King, serious political interviews, flopping breasts, and pubic hair. The film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie. Other than the interesting sex scenes, you'll be bored dry watching this film. Unlike many other reviewers, I think the nude/sexual scenes are overdone for what it is. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better choices. The pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is. I think the cast did a fine job however.

Then the same thing happened to the couple who sat next to us where the couple said thank you for bringing the menus and she walked away without saying anything or smiling! The bartenders and waiters are attentive and nice. The burger here is wonderful! It's big, juicy and full of flavor. 5 stars for a delicious burger!"}

My mistake is I passed by this place so many times thinking I should stop in, especially since it's packed, but figured the alcohol would be overpriced and food would be an expensive art project, at best. I was wrong. Rarely do you stop at a place like this. I've been twice and both visits were everything I'd want for a nice, casual dining experience. The first time I went we were the only ones outside (it looked like it was going to rain.... and it did). The servers offered to reseat us immediately but we actually opted to sit outside and watch the rain. Everything was covered so it wasn't like our server got drenched coming to our table. I had a salmon sandwich, she had a salad and we shared a cheese plate. Everything was portioned and presented very well. The wine and beer they recommend went with the lunch nicely - we had a great time, so we came back a month later. This visit was equally enjoyable.

I mean a total discourse on the film viewing experience. Well if that's the case have I got a lulu of a film experiment for you.In Sophie Fiennes (sister of Ralph & Joseph if you were wondering) has noted philosopher cum cinephile Slavoj Zizek give his analysis on cinema with some impressive (and often outrageous) takes on everything from the silent era of Chaplin thru the modern age of the Wachowski Brothers analyzing, probing, and pontificating about the psychosexual underpinnings, socioeconomic, political and of course indefinable magic of the film going experience with his unflagging, determined and near-frenetic dissertations. To go from explaining how The Bates' house in PSYCHO is actually the mirrored psyche of the conflicted Norman Bates with each level as his Ego, Superego & Id is one thing but then to suggest the same thing about each Marx Brother in barely a beat is a remarkable test of faith that wins over the skeptic layman.Although I had no idea who Zizek was \u0096 he resembles a hybrid of filmmaker Brian DePalma, European actor Rade Serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese \u0096 with his sibilant tongue and passion, the host comes across as a mad prophet. Fiennes cleverly inserts Zizek into several of the film clips' backgrounds peppered throughout making for a humorous tone but still lets the ranting and raving continue full throttle giving pause for argument in three acts covering the gamut of films by the likes of Kubrick, Lynch, Hitchcock and films as diverse as THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE RED SHOES, and FIGHT CLUB. There's something for everyone and if one man can provoke an argument or at least a reason to discuss a film's themes \u0096 even if they are Freudian/Jungian to a fault \u0096 then I say this collection of film theory is worth the watch.

To go from explaining how The Bates' house in PSYCHO is actually the mirrored psyche of the conflicted Norman Bates with each level as his Ego, Superego & Id is one thing but then to suggest the same thing about each Marx Brother in barely a beat is a remarkable test of faith that wins over the skeptic layman.Although I had no idea who Zizek was \u0096 he resembles a hybrid of filmmaker Brian DePalma, European actor Rade Serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese \u0096 with his sibilant tongue and passion, the host comes across as a mad prophet. Fiennes cleverly inserts Zizek into several of the film clips' backgrounds peppered throughout making for a humorous tone but still lets the ranting and raving continue full throttle giving pause for argument in three acts covering the gamut of films by the likes of Kubrick, Lynch, Hitchcock and films as diverse as THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE RED SHOES, and FIGHT CLUB. There's something for everyone and if one man can provoke an argument or at least a reason to discuss a film's themes \u0096 even if they are Freudian/Jungian to a fault \u0096 then I say this collection of film theory is worth the watch. Seek it out now if you can before it comes to home video; it's the only way to appreciate it."}

{"original_text": "In a future society, the military component does not have to recruit; rather, their candidates are chosen at birth, culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government. They are given over to the war machine, body and soul, for no reason other than to protect and serve; they have no personal identity other than a name and rank, and no autonomy whatsoever. This is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in `Soldier,' directed by Paul Anderson and starring Kurt Russell. The scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time, from preadolescence to adulthood. Russell is Sergeant Todd, the best of the best, and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign; he is what he was born to be, a soldier. But even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives when Todd and his peers are no longer the elite. A new generation of soldiers has been created, products of advanced genetics and technology, and Todd's generation is suddenly obsolete. What follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life, while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality, traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life: Fear and discipline. Russell gives a commanding performance as Todd, the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts. He has few lines in this movie, but Russell speaks volumes with his eyes. This role demonstrates that he is, in fact, one of the under-appreciated actors of our times; that he can disappear so entirely into the character of Todd is a credit to his ability, and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before. And he's given Todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype. Notable performances are also turned in here by Connie Nielsen (Sandra) and Jason Isaacs (Colonel Mekum). Rounding out the supporting cast are Jason Scott Lee, memorable as Caine 607, one of the new generation of soldiers; Sean Pertwee (Mace); Gary Busey (Captain Church); Michael Chiklis (Jimmy Pig); and Mark Bringleson (Rubrick). Anderson has delivered an action film with a message, a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science-fiction. `Soldier' reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact. It's an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives, like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference. Much like `1984,' and `Mad Max,' this movie, which is ultimately uplifting, is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of Universe in which we all must live together and share.

{"original_text": "Satan's Little Helper is one of the better B Horror movies I have seen. When I say better I mean the story. The film hatches a new plot, something that's not so clich\u00e9 in the Horror genre - something fresh. But there are also some ridiculous questions that come along with it. Questions you will be asking yourself throughout the movie.The film first caught my attention while I was cruising the Horror section in HMV. I was tired of all the so called \"terrifiying\" Hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different. The cover art for Satan's Little Helper immediately caught my attention. As you can see, the image draws you in - it's chilling! I knew it was a straight to DVD release - but I took a chance. I mean, I just seen \"Boogey Man\" the night before - so It couldn't get any worse! After I watched the movie, I was semi-satisfied. I loved the plot of the movie. It was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend, so he could kill. In some sick deranged way, he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners - a duo of terror. It was a great idea to set the film on Halloween night. This way, no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid. They would simply think he was his guardian. But, this is also where the \"plot holes\" begin to surface.If your son came home with a \"friend\" he met trick or treating - that's fine. You wouldn't think anything of it - if he was 9!, or round about the same age as him. If however, he appeared with a strange man in a mask, you would be startled and protective of your child. You would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself. You would ask why he is with your son. He doesn't know him. You would tell him to please leave. He isn't a family friend. He's a stranger. Now, we're supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers. In this case, the mum is completely fine with it. Huh? They never seem to think it's a tad odd that the \"man\" doesn't speak - at all. Gruanted they think it's the daughters boyfriend, but after 10 minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he's not saying a word.The film goes down hill from there. The thing that got me the most was, all the mum said was \"Do you want some cider?\". I can't count how many times she says this in the movie. It's like, oh you're dying - we have cider though, it's all good!! The movie started promising, and failed to deliver. It was more of a horror/comedy, and even as that it fails to deliver. I guess you could call it a \"Dud\",\"Flop\" etc..The best thing about the movie is the cover art. Though, something tells me that's not worth the 12 dollars!", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Satan's Little Helper is one of the better B Horror movies I have seen.

As you can see, the image draws you in - it's chilling! I knew it was a straight to DVD release - but I took a chance. I mean, I just seen \"Boogey Man\" the night before - so It couldn't get any worse! After I watched the movie, I was semi-satisfied. I loved the plot of the movie. It was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend, so he could kill. In some sick deranged way, he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners - a duo of terror. It was a great idea to set the film on Halloween night. This way, no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid. They would simply think he was his guardian. But, this is also where the \"plot holes\" begin to surface.If your son came home with a \"friend\" he met trick or treating - that's fine. You wouldn't think anything of it - if he was 9!, or round about the same age as him. If however, he appeared with a strange man in a mask, you would be startled and protective of your child. You would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself. You would ask why he is with your son. He doesn't know him. You would tell him to please leave. He isn't a family friend. He's a stranger. Now, we're supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers. In this case, the mum is completely fine with it. Huh? They never seem to think it's a tad odd that the \"man\" doesn't speak - at all. Gruanted they think it's the daughters boyfriend, but after 10 minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he's not saying a word.The film goes down hill from there. The thing that got me the most was, all the mum said was \"Do you want some cider?\". I can't count how many times she says this in the movie. It's like, oh you're dying - we have cider though, it's all good!! The movie started promising, and failed to deliver. It was more of a horror/comedy, and even as that it fails to deliver. I guess you could call it a \"Dud\",\"Flop\" etc..The best thing about the movie is the cover art. Though, something tells me that's not worth the 12 dollars!"}

{"original_text": "One of the worst customer service I have ever experienced at any Toyota service center! Twice in the past half year, I have had very poor customer service here. The first time was when I bought my car in specifically asking for an inspection of my right front tire, informing them it had been leaking air a few days ago and I had to pull over to get air pumped in. They found nothing.... only 2 days later, that same tire went completely flat. I took my car to a local auto shop, and they found a huge nail stuck in the tire that would've been found if Toyota had done a careful inspection the first time. Second experience was even worse and more shocking. I took my car in for servicing on a Saturday morning. The service person could not answer many of my questions, and when he stated that he was new, I kindly asked him how long he'd been working there (thinking that if he was so new that he didn't know a lot of info, that I'd ask another representative to help me). Out of nowhere, he yelled out in an extremely rude and angry manner, \"That's none of your business!.... I won't have you harrassing me...\" Everyone in the room was startled and turned around to see why he was shouting so loudly. Perhaps he acted this way because there was no manager on duty, however, this behavior is customer service at its worst. As a person in the service industry myself (I am a physician and my patients' health, safety and satisfaction come first), I am shocked by his blatantly inappropriate and unacceptable behavior.

Perhaps art will always mean the most to its creator.The Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch film. Not that there's anything typical about them anyway. It's an odyssey through rural America. A real life journey Alvin Straight took on a lawn mower to get to his brothers house. He rode 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin to make amends to his sick brother for past offenses.At the heart of this film is sweet voiced Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin Straight right to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film is slow paced matches Alvin's slow journey toward realization.Along the way Alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl. She is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation. After listening to Alvin speak about family she reconsiders.Later Alvin witnesses a distraught woman kill a deer with her car. She complains that she has killed several and leaves. Alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook up some dear meat that night.Later Alvin's lawn mower loses its brakes and nearly kills him. A nice man and his wife let him stay in their yard while he gets it fixed. They even let him call his sweet but slow daughter, nicely played by Sissy Spacek, whose haunted by a terrible tragedy in her own past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The man even offers to drive Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin declines with thanks.While Alvin waits he also goes off to a bar with a kindly old man as they discuss the harshness of war and the price it took on their souls. Alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper that has forever haunted him.Alvin also encounters two bickering brothers who've repaired his lawn mower.

He even helps them to appreciate one another learning from his own mistakes with his brother.The night before Alvin leaves the man's yard he takes his hat off to him. The man tells him it was an honor having him stay and asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in it's simplicity. It's heartfelt because it's so straight, so real.The journey continues and we can't help to get more and more involved with it. We want Alvin to get to his brothers. We want him to make amends.

From farm-fresh produce to gourmet goodies, they cater to every culinary craving. The moment I stepped inside, I was greeted by friendly staff who were more than happy to assist me in finding all the ingredients I needed for my recipes. The aisles were immaculately organized, making my shopping experience an absolute breeze. But what truly sets Publix apart is their impressive variety of specialty items. I discovered a world of international cheeses, exotic spices, and artisanal bread that made my taste buds dance with joy! And let's not forget their bakery section \u2013 a paradise for carb aficionados! The heavenly aroma of freshly baked breads and pastries was simply irresistible. The quality of their products is top-notch, and I often found myself lingering in the fresh seafood section, marveling at the wide selection. The meat department is equally impressive, offering a variety of cuts that would satisfy even the pickiest carnivore. What impressed me the most, however, was the Publix Deli. Their mouthwatering sandwiches and salads are made to order, ensuring a delicious and satisfying meal. It's a great spot for a quick lunch or a grab-and-go dinner. Publix Super Market truly lives up to its reputation as a food lover's paradise.

These were thick-cut, rich in taste [gratis the duck fat, one presumes], not actually greasy, but definitely better when ordered with the cup of cheese sauce on the side. We also got soft pretzel sticks, which would have been fine but not especially remarkable without the mustard sauce (which had a distinct taste of raspberry, to my mind) pooled in the cup underneath them.

{"original_text": "A unique film...one of the best of all time. Acting, script, Quincy Jones' score, cinematography, editing, etc. -- just fantastic. As most viewers know, this movie is based on Truman Capote's book about the famous murder of a Kansas farm family (the Clutters) by a couple of young guys during a misguided robbery. I've never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into a riveting film. The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team pursuing them. Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is amazing. Cocky, twitchy, and devoid of compassion he comes across so charming, oily and plausible. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is extraordinary as well -- lonely, and at once empathetic and cold-blooded. Who could fold these characteristics into one individual and make us buy it? He does, and it's brilliant! A key point of the book is how it took the intersection of these two very differently sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and heinous crime, and these two actors make it work beautifully. Both had moments in their subsequent careers, but these performances are high water marks, and that stands for acting period. The cops are wonderful too. Leading the investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are great as well. Unlike contemporary movies where producers feel it necessary to endow police with superhuman assets or foibles, these are just genuine flatfeet, working the case with determination and competence. They seem so real. I've never seen cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity; and I've seen most of the crime classics going way back. Really one of a kind in this respect. PARTIAL SPOILER COMING (this movie's unique in that you already know what's happened, but I'm warning for the record). Of course, the best scenes from the best crime shows and movies are the interrogations -- the intellectual fencing matches between the cops and the crooks, Mano a Mano. This movie has hands down the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see on film. Watch Dick and Perry try to bluff their way through and slowly unravel, unaware the cops have the goods on them. But the cops need to deftly prep their suspects to fracture their alibis and hopefully elicit confessions. This is some of the best acting you'll ever see. Think Glengarry Glen Ross without the showboating. To help translate the sad and horrific angles of this true story, ICB was filmed at the actual Clutter house, and I've heard the Clutters were played by film students to give them a genuine feel. It works. These seem like decent, simple folk. It makes the crime so palpable and sad. I'll stop here.

{"original_text": "The problem with \"The Killer Elite\" is that just by seeking this film out, and investing time to watch it, you are putting more effort into the experience than many of its principals did, particularly director Sam Peckinpah.The already volatile Peckinpah was heading into rough weather with this film. According to at least one biographer, this was where he became acquainted with cocaine. Add to that his binge drinking, and it's no wonder things fell apart.It's a shame, because the concept behind the film is a good one, and the first ten minutes promise much. Mike Locken (James Caan) and George Hansen (Robert Duvall) are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the CIA. They move quick, live well, and seem like the best of friends - then something happens to shatter their brotherhood.An opening scene shows them blowing up a building - why exactly we aren't told, par for the course in terms of this film's murky motivation. But the implication is these guys hurt people and don't really care - antiheroes much like the Wild Bunch of Peckinpah's not-so-long-ago. An opening title tells us they work for ComTeg, then adds with obvious tongue in cheek \"...the thought the CIA might employ such an organization for any purpose is, of course, preposterous.\" That's a pretty clever way of letting the audience know all bets are off.Add to that a traditionally strong Peckinpah backup cast, including Burt Young, Gig Young, and Peckinpah regular Bo Hopkins in the plum role of a madman who can't pass up an opportunity to be shot at for $500 a day, and you only wish that the scriptwriters, including the celebrated Sterling Silliphant, tried to do something more with the story than turn it into a platform for lazy one-liners and bad chop-socky knockoffs. An attempt at injecting a dose of liberal social commentary is awkwardly shoehorned in. \"You're so busy doing their dirty work, you can't tell who the bad guys are,\" someone tells Locken, as if either he or we need it pointed out.Worse still are Peckinpah's clumsy direction and sluggish pacing. We're 40 minutes into the film before we get our first battle scene, a completely chaotic collection of random shots where a bunch of people we haven't even met before are seen fighting at San Francisco Airport, their battle intercut with a conversation in an office suite.By the end of the film, what's left of the cast is having a battle inside a fleet of mothballed Victory Ships, ninjas running out in the open to be gunned down while Caan tosses off one liners that undercut any hint of real suspense. \"Lay me seven-to-five, I'll take the little guy,\" he wisecracks just before a climatic samurai duel between two ninja warriors - from China, which we all know is the land of the Ninja. (The battle takes place in San Francisco, but surprisingly no Mounties arrive to break things up.)Caan is much better in smaller scenes, like when Locken, recovering from some nasty injuries, is told by one of his bosses, played by a smooth Arthur Hill, that he's been \"Humpty-dumped\" by the organization. Caan refuses to stay down, and his recovery scenes, though momentum-killing for the movie, feature fine acting from him and Amy Heflin, Van's daughter, as a supportive nurse. Caan was one of the 1970s' best actors, and his laconic byplay with Heflin, Duvall, Hopkins, and both Youngs give \"Killer Elite\" real watchability.But you don't watch \"Killer Elite\" thinking about that.

The only thing they're missing on their buffet is Black Pepper Chicken, maybe they have it on the dinner buffet. I've never been here for dinner so I don't know what changes on the dinner buffet.

{"original_text": "This is such a fantastic movie, a Western about a self-concerned man (Jimmy Stewart) going up to the Klondike for gold. On the way, he gets hassled by a local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, giving a wonderfully evil performance), whom he hassles back. McIntire threatens that he'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town, which is, unfortunately, the only way back to the States. The main chunk of the story is about the peaceful Klondike town of Dawson being turned upside down by new residents from McIntire's town. Ruth Roman, for instance, who has come with Stewart and his two companions (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, who plays Stewart's best friend), builds a saloon (a Hollywood front for a whorehouse) and tries to run the town's restaurant and hang-out place out of business. She paves the way for McIntire and his goons to come up, too. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the peaks of the Western genre, The Naked Spur. The Far Country is just the tiniest bit less, and it contains 99.9% of what made that film so special without, of course, feeling like a cheap copy. Like The Naked Spur, The Far Country boasts beautiful, on-location cinematography. The landscape is gorgeous. Stewart gives one of his best performances (nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954, Rear Window). I suppose it could be considered cliche, as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end. Still, Stewart plays it so damn well, he makes this character very human. And the supporting performances are universally fantastic. In addition to those I've mentioned, the adorable French actress Corinne Calvet is very good. And I ought to single out Walter Brennen, as well. He seems to have specialized in playing best friends. His relationship with Stewart is very touching, since he is, at first, the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man. The screenplay is very well written, and Mann's direction is impeccable.

Arthur is the acclaimed comedy classic about a drunken millionaire (played with enthusiasm and wit by Dudley Moore in an Oscar-nominated performance) who must choose between the woman he loves and the life he's grown accustomed to. While the basic plot is one big cliche, there's nothing trite about this congenial combination of clever dialogue and hilarious farce. Arthur Bach is essentially nothing more than a pretentious jerk, but you can't help but like him. Especially when he delivers lines such as, \"Don't you wish you were me? I know I do!\" He's also a delineation from the archetypical movie hero: unlike most wealthy characters we see on the silver screen, he's not ashamed of being filthy rich. In one scene, a man asks him, \"What does it feel like to have all that money?,\" to which he responds, \"It feels great.\" Moore lends such charisma and charm to a character that would otherwise be loathed by his audience. And Gielgud is simply perfect as the arrogant servant, addressing his master with extreme condescension in spite of the fact that his salary depends on him. Arthur is one of those movies that doesn't try to be brilliant or particularly exceptional: it just comes naturally. The screenplay -- which also earned a nod from the Academy -- is saturated with authentic laugh-out-loud dialogue. This is the kind of movie that, when together with a bunch of poker buddies, you quote endlessly to one another. It also looks at its characters with sincere empathy. There have been a number of comedies that attempt to dip into drama by including the death or illness of a principal star (including both Grumpy Old Men's), but few can carry it off because we just don't care. When this movie makes the dubious decision to knock off the butler, it actually works, because we genuinely like these people. Why should you see Arthur?

Now imagine yourself sharing this gift with the love of your life. What would you do? Would such powers be worth your soul? This is the dilemma presented to Captain Christopher Pike in \"The Cage\" the now-legendary pilot episode of the original Star Trek series. Famously deemed \"too cerebral\" and \"too cold\" by NBC brass and rejected, \"The Cage\" was nevertheless the most ambitious and costly pilot ever made in the history of the network at the time, and Gene Roddenberry did not want to let all that effort and expense go to waste, with the result being this truly classic Star Trek episode, which embeds \"The Cage\" into a frame story which deepens and extends the emotional and philosophical depth of this haunting tale, a landmark in TV history and one of the first truly serious sci-fi stories ever filmed for the small screen...Star Date 3012: The USS Enterprise diverts to Starbase 11 after Mr. Spock receives an urgent message from the former commander of the Enterprise. Surprisingly, the message cannot be from Captain Pike after all, as he is now confined to a wheelchair, mute and horribly disfigured after a tragic accident. Kirk and Starbase commanding officer Commodore Mendez attempt to get to the bottom of the mystery, but before the matter can be cleared up, Spock - for reasons as yet unknown - commits an act of open mutiny, kidnapping the helpless Captain Pike and hijacking the Enterprise via a brilliantly thought-out and timed plan aided by a few Vulcan nerve pinches. Soon, the Enterprise is headed for the remote, forbidden planet of Talos IV. Mendez informs Kirk that Talos IV is under interdiction, and any contact with the planet by Starfleet vessels or personnel carries an immediate death sentence, meaning that Spock appears to be deliberately destroying himself, and Kirk as well, given that the Captain will be held responsible for the ship's activities. Appalled, Kirk and Mendez give chase in a shuttlecraft, which itself becomes dangerous when the Enterprise refuses to answer their calls or pick up the craft until power and oxygen are nearly gone. Spock - knowing that Kirk must be the one following the ship - is of course unable to consign the Captain to certain death. After ordering the craft to be retrieved and the occupants beamed aboard, Spock reveals what he has done to McCoy and demands to be arrested, after having set the starship on an irreversible course to Talos IV. Upon reassuming command, Kirk demands an explanation, whereupon Spock requests immediate court martial by a tribunal of Starfleet commanding officers - of whom there are three on board - Mendez, Kirk, and the crippled invalid Captain Pike. Spock's encyclopedic knowledge of Starfleet regulations enables him to manipulate the tribunal into allowing him to present otherwise inadmissible evidence. Spock presents video recordings of the only contact ever made between the Federation and the inhabitants of Talos IV - a journey taken 13 years earlier by the Enterprise itself under Pike's command. Kirk expresses doubts about the authenticity of the video due to its extreme detail, but the reality of the events depicted is confirmed by Pike himself, who turns out to have been lured to Talos IV by a distress call from the alleged survivors of a Federation research vessel which crashed there 18 years previously. Among the survivors is Vina, a stunning beauty said to have been born just before the disaster. Pike is attracted to the girl and allows her to lure him to an isolated spot, whereupon he is waylaid and captured by the Talosians, a race of androgynous humanoids with enormous cranial capacity and the power to transform thoughts into virtual reality. After Pike's capture, the rest of the \"survivors\" vanish as none of them really existed except Vina. The episode ends when the tribunal learns that Spock's \"evidence\" is in fact being transmitted to the Enterprise directly from Talos IV, in violation of Starfleet regulations.

Tolkien weaves a mesmerizing tale that follows the journey of Bilbo Baggins, a reluctant and unassuming hobbit, thrust into an unexpected adventure with a group of dwarves and the enigmatic wizard, Gandalf. Tolkien's vivid descriptions bring Middle-earth to life, immersing readers in its sprawling landscapes and diverse cultures. The attention to detail is extraordinary, from the intricate Elven realms to the treacherous depths of the Misty Mountains.

They will be scorned, or deemed perverted, for expressing their passion through dance.This film is well worth watching to witness the rebirth of human emotions and passions. It will leave a smile on your face for days."}

{"original_text": "\"This Man's Navy\" is, as other comments have indicated, a rare and well-filmed look at Navy lighter than air (LTA) activities. The LTA crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack. And the filming at the various NAS locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone. However, the first half of the movie is all about Beery, his relationship with his service pals, and him meeting the Tom Drake character and his mother, and getting Drake's leg fixed. Only then does the second film start. The second film is mostly LTAs in action, taking on a surfaced sub, guys get killed and much damage is caused. The look is fairly gritty and realistic, I imagine. Then we shift to Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have LTAs there? Never mind, this part is really wild, with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle. And the Japs are shooting like mad. Shades of Vietnam, except the getaway is oh, so leisurely. This is a blimp we're talking about.

I was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of New York Pizza Grill, but now I'm not sure what to say, only to say it carefully. I knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where I am currently residing. As soon as I saw the flier I grabbed my room key and went looking for this person. In hindsight that was not smart, as soon as I got a look at the guy, I ran for the elevator. Now, I am no shrinking violet, but this guy looked like he's slap his own mother. After reading the other reviews on here, I guess I should be happy that this employee didn't turn around and attack! My biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers. They sneak into hotels, a place where you feel safe and after this, I don't. It doesn't seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business. I did call every one of the pizza place that do this, because I felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel, but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for New York Pizza Grill, I had it. I do not feel safe and I told management that, and the did call the police. So, for the employee of New York Pizza Grill, if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong, you are more than likely going to be arrested.

{"original_text": "First off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that I hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as being so stupid that you wounder if they're all the result of inbreeding.Now I will say this I did see the first three American Pie movies and while they weren't the most amazing movies that I'd ever seen they were all right (and outright masterpieces compared to the three \"American Pie Presents\" films), I still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie?I also have a few other questions too.Who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources? who approved the final script (and what was that person smoking when they approved it)? And lastly why did anyone think that it deserved to be released into theaters where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you live when it should have gone straight to the discount bin at Blockbuster or Wal Mart?There is so much wrong with this movie that I can't write a really comprehensive review of it because it would exceed the maximum allowed words on this forum so I'll just touch on the biggest things wrong with it.The plot is generic uninspired and stupid and characters are all about as interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minutes but the biggest thing that I can see wrong with this movie is the acting.While most of the cast are talentless no namers who will probably be forgotten in a few years,the one and only big name in this movie is Eugene Levy who spends almost all of the time he is on screen with this knowing smirk on his face that says to the viewer \"I know this isn't funny and I'm wasting my talents but hey I'm getting payed for it so who cares\" he doesn't even try to make any of his jokes funny (he really deserves better than this garbage). As I mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are horrible even though some of them have been in some really great TV shows, Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back) plays a character who is so unbearable unlikeable and irritating (there are things that he could teach to tropical skin diseases)that you almost wish he'd die a slow and painful death on screen, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) just hangs around on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this film.Maybe the next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line so they can get around the MPAA and get an R rating this movie goes all out with pointless nudity vulgarity and pointlessly offencive sexual content that it should have gotten the X rating (the ratings board must have been drunk or on drugs when they reviewed this film for its rating). It's interesting that twenty five years ago when Wes Craven submitted A Nightmare On Elm Street to the MPAA for a rating review they forced him to cut twenty five seconds of footage (I believe that it was part of a death scene that had a silicone casting of a breast in it) to avoid getting an X rating and he had no other choice but to do it or the film wouldn't have been released, but this kind of needlessly offensive trash can get the R rating today because it's all done in the name of comedy, if this movie was a drama or horror film with this kind of content there would have been a huge stink over the content and it would havegotten the dreaded X rating.The last thing that really annoys me is the writing, this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old kid with an extremely overactive sexual imagination its quite juvenile and extraordinarily crass, nearly every expository situation that is supposed to move the corpse that this movie calls a plot along is so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and and the so called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes, never mind the often repulsive sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior it feels like this film was written by some incompetent first year hack in a low rent film school script writing class.the long and short of it is its time to kill this series before it gets any stupider more crass and offensive, this pie is filled with road apples.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "First off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that I hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as being so stupid that you wounder if they're all the result of inbreeding.Now I will say this I did see the first three American Pie movies and while they weren't the most amazing movies that I'd ever seen they were all right (and outright masterpieces compared to the three \"American Pie Presents\" films), I still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie?I also have a few other questions too.Who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources? who approved the final script (and what was that person smoking when they approved it)?

{"original_text": "Lawrence Olivier and Merle Oberon did two movies together within two years. One is considered one of the great romantic films of all time, and the movie that made Olivier a great movie star (and gave Oberon her best performance role): WUTHERING HEIGHTS. The other is this film, made in England a year earlier. THE DIVORCE OF LADY X is a romantic comedy (as WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a romantic tragedy). Olivier is a lawyer, Everard Logan, who is a dynamic barrister, but is also a total misogynist. One night he checks into a hotel just ahead of a crowd of people. It is a very foggy night (the type of pea soup fog that London was known for up until a notorious \"killer\" fog in the 1950s), and the crowd (who'd been attending a party in the hotel) need beds. The management tries to get Logan to allow one or two socialite ladies to sleep on a couch and a day bed in his rooms, but he refuses. But he has not reckoned with Merle Oberon as Leslie Steele. The granddaughter of a high court judge, she manages to get into Logan's rooms and manipulates him to not only agree to her sleeping there, but appropriates his bed (he goes onto the couch - much to his discomfort).The next day they share a breakfast, and in the smalltalk it is evident that despite his mistrust of women Logan finds Leslie very attractive. But she kittenishly refuses to tell him her name. She is determined to learn more about him, and she finds his attitude toward women infuriating. In the meantime, Logan is approached by a wealthy nobleman (Ralph Richardson as Lord Mere) as a potential client. Mere suspects his wife Lady Mere (Binnie Barnes) of having an affair. In fact, he tells Logan her Ladyship was with her lover in the hotel that Logan knows he was in on the night of the fog. Logan (naturally) jumps to the conclusion that Lady Mere was his mysterious roommate that night. I will not go into the plot any further, except to say that Leslie eventually realizes what a mistake Logan has made, and decides to use it to teach him a lesson about women.The script has the feel of a Wodehouse novel, but is slighter. Still the performances of Olivier, Oberon, Richardson, Barnes, and Morton Selden (as Oberon's grandfather) are all splendid. It shows what a good cast can do with even the slightest of materials. Take a look at some of the minor scenes to see what I mean: Selden's first scene, complaining about his weak coffee to his butler/valet, who tells him off properly (they've been used to each other's personalities for years). Or Olivier dealing with a young clerk in his office, who is certain there were two Lady Meres in the office two minutes before (there were, but Oberon and Barnes left together), and ends up thinking the poor clerk is a simpleton. Or the waiter in the hotel who can't understand why the tenant in Olivier's room is constantly changing from a man to a woman to a man.

The Iron Chefs themselves are very interesting. I know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time, but Bobby Flay is the only American Iron Chef to beat them.

The judges are not always the best choices, however. There are a few exceptions, like the lawyer turned foodie, but most of the judges are questionable in being able to handle what is served.

We've never seen her before so it really feels like her story. She also brings across genuine toughness. This works against her though, because we never doubt her. You never have to cheer for her to win because she never goes up against any fighter we don't think she can beat. So as a boxing movie, it fails.Then again, this isn't really a boxing movie. How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer that isn't a boxing movie? You don't. But Karyn Kusama has anyway. Like many indie films, \"Girlfight\" defies classification or genre and stands on its own as folklore that could darn near happen in real life.Diana is doing poorly in school. She beats up people she doesn't like (all the other girls in her school for example). She doesn't fit in. Her father is forcing her kid brother Tiny to learn to box so he can defend himself when things get tough. He gives Tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives Diana nothing, as if she has no need to defend herself, nor anything worthwhile to make of her life. Tiny wants to go to art school (cliche', yuck), so he gives up his boxing allowance to Diana, who actually wants to box. Things get complicated when Diana falls for another boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who's looking to turn pro. From there the story winds down toward the inevitable...the two meet in the amateur title fight.What left me cold was that I never found any of this all that interesting. It's all just a bit too believable. Kids with tough lives growing up in rough urban areas fall back on sports. A lot of professional boxers have risen from these circumstances. The mental and physical toughness this upbringing requires lends itself to a game like boxing, where anger is your friend. So this time it's a girl. Big deal.Or there's another position to take: finally, a boxing movie about a girl. Women's boxing has been around a long time. The brutality we usually see in boxing films is replaced here by discussions of people's their lives and their feelings. The whole fighting thing is used as a platform from which to paint a larger picture. Respect. Overcoming adversity. Self-discovery.I recommend \"Girlfight\" because it has a good spirit and is an example of some great work by a first time director.

It's all just a bit too believable. Kids with tough lives growing up in rough urban areas fall back on sports. A lot of professional boxers have risen from these circumstances. The mental and physical toughness this upbringing requires lends itself to a game like boxing, where anger is your friend. So this time it's a girl. Big deal.Or there's another position to take: finally, a boxing movie about a girl. Women's boxing has been around a long time. The brutality we usually see in boxing films is replaced here by discussions of people's their lives and their feelings. The whole fighting thing is used as a platform from which to paint a larger picture. Respect. Overcoming adversity. Self-discovery.I recommend \"Girlfight\" because it has a good spirit and is an example of some great work by a first time director. The dialogue never rises above soap opera quality, but the story itself actually changed my view on some things. Yes, the world now seems like a better place."}

{"original_text": "I've been going to this place since it was just the casino as I was not of age for the glory days of Seminole bingo. The HRC has had good moments and it's had bad moments. Yes, it is often very smoky; if this bothers you you may not enjoy the odor. The drinks are expensive but that's to be understood given that they aren't your local podunk dive. The casino has always been relatively clean when I've gone. For anyone complaining that the machines must be rigged because they aren't paying out, the reason that they are there is to take money from you and give it to themselves; payout is not guaranteed and you should never gamble more than you can afford to lose. As to the service, my reactions have taken a steady downward turn since opening. My first time there my date and I enjoyed dinner at Floyd's and were served by a young man named Kurt (so good I remember his name all these years later) and were happy with the food and elated with his service. On other occasions I would go either alone or with coworkers. As my coworkers and I got out of work late the casino was a place we could go to eat, drink, and make merry. When we would arrive during late hours and eat at the open restaurants we were treated poorly by people that acted as though they did not want to be there and the food served was substandard. I am not a particularly picky eater but a slab of bend-your-fork frozen pie or green beans that hold a similar temperature to refrigerator from whence they probably came shouldn't be what I expect from a place that charges what the HRC does. If the restaurants don't want people to come in late they shouldn't be open, and if the employees don't want to work late hours they should find other employment. As for the casino employees on the floor I have a generally neutral impression as I don't bug them and they don't bug me but one particular instance stands out. On a brief jaunt through the slot machines on my way to dinner at the casino I won a hair over $10. I kept the slip and cashed out on my way out and the lady working the cashier's desk asked if I was serious about wanting this paltry sum. Surely if that is the attitude of the casino they wouldn't mind if I lost $10 and just took my money back because they have far more than I do and shouldn't mind me keeping that. I don't care if I won a nickel or thousand dollars; the only thing people working the cage should say about your winnings is, \"Congratulations.\" As to the new parking fee, I'm not looking to get the same canned response from their rep that everyone else has been getting. HRC can say anything they like about security or bringing themselves in line with other hotels; I've never had a security problem there and a business should be going out of the way to make themselves different from others. Anybody with a lick of sense can see that the reason for implementing the parking charge is as a way to keep the rabble out of the casino. As I've said I tend to go at night due to keeping late hours and brother, some of the folks that come late at night are skeevy as all get out. These folks come in already drunk, annoy other patrons, and spend nearly no money. The casino also makes no money off frugal folks that come in and take up seats while making the smallest bets possible and pinch pennies so hard that Abe Lincoln filed a restraining order. Implementing the parking fee is a way to keep the cheap or disruptive people out while not deterring the relatively small percentage of patrons that spend a lot and make up the majority of their profit. My main concern with using this tactic to keep out undesirables is that eventually the groups will realize that they can save the money by packing folks in to a minivan and splitting the cost between six or eight of them, only to have another pack of drunks or misers do the same and rather than ten individuals taking up ten parking spots and ten places at the casino you're have sixty or more individuals taking up ten parking spots and sixty or more places at the casino.

The atmosphere is really nice but it's the food that really hits it out of the field... I had the Penne Sausage and it was probably the best pasta dish I have ever had. My boyfriend had the Alfredo (which of course I tried) and it was delicious, creamy and buttery. I very much enjoyed the house salad. Don't change a thing! I could sit and eat that bread and olive oil all day if you let me =P Big portions, great service.

{"original_text": "I just got the UK 4-disc special edition of Superman 1 for about $5. The additional stuff includes the 1951 feature Superman and the Mole-Men. So I slapped it into the DVD player last night, and here are my findings.Some initial disappointment - I hadn't checked, and I think I had it mentally tagged as one of the Kirk Alyn serials. I'm not a huge fan of George Reeves as Superman, and I hadn't seen anything other than the odd clip of Kirk Alyn - but hey ho, never mind.This black and white production runs for less than an hour. It has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of Reeves' early TV series, a two-parter, put together for cinema release, although IMDb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first TV series. In any event, it's an odd choice for reasons I'll get to later. I'm of an age where I recall TV and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets, so there were no major surprises here. Even so, for a low budget movie, this one is REALLY low budget.The story concerns the small town of Silsby - population 1,430 - which, puzzlingly, is also home to the world's deepest oil well (6 miles). The story opens with the well's foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down. This conflicts with the arrival of Metropolis reporters Kent and Lane to report on the well, at the behest of the oil company. As Clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down, a couple of odd little guys (small in stature, big in head, black in jumpsuit, and bushy in eyebrow) emerge from the capped-off drillshaft, and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces.A deep breath now, here is the remaining plot of the picture. The little guys scare some kids, so Jeff Corey (playing the town's rampant xenophobe) incites some pals to kill these \"creatures\". Superman steps in (moderately ineffectually) and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital. Corey's pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed, but he escapes and legs it down the shaft. Corey incites a lynch mob (despite the sheriff arresting him) to hang the hospitalised Mole-Man. Superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows. A total of 4 Mole-Men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at Jeff Corey (I call this an Aargh! gun because its sole effect seems to be to make Corey go \"Aargh!\") and Superman saves him. He immediately changes his ways because of amazement at Superman saving him after the way he has behaved, the Mole-men go back down the shaft. The end.Despite the film only being an hour long, there is an inordinate amount of creeping around, bewareing and pursuing - I have left out all the \"Mole-Man 1 creeps from A to B, looking out to make sure no-one is following him\" stuff. The Mole-Men are never engaged in any way whatsoever - they have no dialogue - they just turn up, get persecuted, and go back. They do look a little creepy, but they are hardly the bug-eyed monsters that the town's reaction implies.Reeves is quite a good Clark Kent - very much a hard-nosed reporter, much more so than Phyllis Coates' rather indifferent Lois Lane. But he is a terrible, terrible Superman. Not only does he not look the part (at least his hair is dyed black in this, which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the TV episodes), the way he plays it is all wrong in my book. I'm sure he was told to \"strike the pose\" (which Superman does constantly), but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips, not fists on ribs. And he plays Superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher - he doesn't actually wag his finger in remonstration, but he may as well have done.And Superman does a huge amount of walking around (I say a huge amount - he isn't actually in it all that much), and a bit of running. He takes off and lands a couple of times, but isn't seen in flight at any point. Oh, some bullets bounce off him, and he uses telescopic vision as Clark, but with no accompanying visual effect. In fact, visual effects are conspicuous by their absence, and the few which are present aren't very good.I've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time: but even by those standards I think it's a pretty threadbare effort. Thankfully, production standards on the TV series were higher, and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them.Something of a disappointment - I shan't be watching it again.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I just got the UK 4-disc special edition of Superman 1 for about $5.

The one that had villains with real motives?Well clearly, Warner Bros. doesn't. Hence this dreck.Honestly, do these people know anything about batman? Have they even looked at a batman comic before? Do they know Batman's meant to be a'detective'? Putting together 2 clues does not make you a detective! That makes you a slightly intelligent monkey!This is the basic layout for an episode:Penguin steals something.'Opening credits'. Batman finds dead giveaway of where he is. Batman goes there and get's into trouble. Commercial. Batman finds obvious/ stupid way out of it. Penguin escapes. Penguin does something obvious again. Batman follows. They do kung-fu (by the way everyone, and I mean EVERYONE know's kung-fu for some reason). Batman punch's penguin. he get's knocked out. goes to arkham. (Note: it's usually a different villain every episode)Well as you may have noticed from that, Batman's not a great detective. \"Joker left this piece of cotton candy on the ground, maybe he's at the old amusement park\"!

Afterall, what would batman be without his rogues gallery?Well first off, I gotta say, kudos for originality.

He then continues to steal jewels for no reason, while saying sh!t lines like \"Have an ice day\".Maybe they did watch Batman &Robin after all.But hey, look on the bright side.

{"original_text": "The \"saucy\" misadventures of four au pairs who arrive in London on the same day in the early 1970s. There's a Swedish girl, a Danish, a German and a Chinese. The story contrives to get the clothes off all of them, involve them in some Carry On-type humour and couple them with various misfits from the British film and TV culture of the time, including Man About the House star Richard O'Sullivan, future Coronation Street rogue Johnny Briggs and horror film stalwart Ferdy Mayne (playing a sheik). There's a pretty risqu\u00e9 amount of female nudity on display, for those who like that kind of thing (but obviously nothing hardcore).Most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential; the girls are stereotypes, and German Anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder - she's a moron obsessed with colour TV who acts like a kind of uninhibited child & dresses to deliberately show her private parts; in another more serious film, she would be a psychiatric case. The most interesting section of the film involves the Swedish girl being taken to a club in London where some dodgy types are still trying to swing, being seduced by a middle-aged rocker, losing her virginity and realising that the scene is not for her. These sequences have some energy in them and point to a more intriguing film than we've ended up with, in which promiscuity and the dregs of the music business and upper classes live soulless and seedy lives (there's a fine turn by John Standing as an impotent public school rou\u00e9). The strangest of the stories has the Chinese girl (future cannibal film veteran Me Me Lay) getting off with her childish piano prodigy employer, falling mutually in love with and then leaving in the middle of the night for no good reason at all, except some orientalist notion that \"Chinese birds are inscrutable, ain't they?!\" The film is pretty demeaning to its women characters and there's a smattering of homophobia in the dialogue and one of the characterisations. The end is striking, as Mayne's sheik for no earthly reason (except they have to end the film somehow) whisks all of the girls away to his Arab kingdom for what looks to all the world like a future in the white slave trade, which they are all delighted about.Stuff and nonsense for the most part then, but directed with a fair amount of skill by veteran Val Guest, which puts it as a piece of film-making a notch above most of the 70s Brit sexploitation flicks.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "The \"saucy\" misadventures of four au pairs who arrive in London on the same day in the early 1970s.

For instance, we had a bulb burn out moments after we were in our room. Without pause or hesitation it was taken care of. All I simply wanted to do was inform them to attend to it at the leisure since we were not going to be there often anyways... that was not good enough, they addressed it with urgent care. Wow, all for a light bulb! I am confident that if I required any additional services they would have responded the same. It is such a contrast when you stay there.

{"original_text": "SciFi has been having some extremely bad luck making quality movies lately (such as Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic Beowulf, however, it deviates so much (and offers so little in comparison) that the advertisements on television might as well have titled it'some shitty Christopher Lambert movie'. I wasn't expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown Hollywood production, but I did however expect the'artistic integrity' to not interfere with the actual story (even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slots).Did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing (did any research go into this?). Obviously not, as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that Beowulf and his crew (save for mullet boy) are wearing. One major problem I have though was with the very look of Grendel if Beowulf is supposed to wrestle him, shouldn't he not have been sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons? Grendel's death segment was also lacking in every way \u0096 in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script; for example: Grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by Beowulf \u0096 not cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs!

Grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic Beowulf, however, it deviates so much (and offers so little in comparison) that the advertisements on television might as well have titled it'some shitty Christopher Lambert movie'. I wasn't expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown Hollywood production, but I did however expect the'artistic integrity' to not interfere with the actual story (even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slots).Did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing (did any research go into this?). Obviously not, as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that Beowulf and his crew (save for mullet boy) are wearing. One major problem I have though was with the very look of Grendel if Beowulf is supposed to wrestle him, shouldn't he not have been sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons? Grendel's death segment was also lacking in every way \u0096 in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script; for example: Grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by Beowulf \u0096 not cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs!

{"original_text": "The movie had so much potential but failed to live up to it. Directed by Stephen King himself, I had high expectations for \"Maximum Overdrive\" considering his success as a renowned author. However, I found myself disappointed with the overall execution of the film. One of the biggest letdowns was the lack of character development. The movie introduces a range of characters, from the newlywed couple to truckers and even a young boy, but fails to provide any depth to their personalities. As a result, it becomes challenging to empathize or invest in their survival during the chaotic events that unfold. Moreover, the plot felt quite thin and lacked coherence.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "\"Maximum\" is a film based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Stephen King, which tells the story of a group of people living in a post-apocalyptic America who are caught up in a deadly virus that threatens to wipe out the human race in a matter of days, writes the BBC's Geeta Pandey in her review of the film."}

{"original_text": "\"The Burning\" is a true gem of the horror genre, igniting fear and chills in equal measure. From the opening scene to the very last frame, this 80s slasher flick delivers a blood-soaked rollercoaster ride that will leave you both terrified and entertained. What sets \"The Burning\" apart from other slashers of its time is its clever storytelling and well-developed characters. Unlike the mindless killing sprees seen in many horror films, this movie takes the time to build a sense of dread by establishing a group of likable campers at Camp Blackfoot. As tension mounts, so does the anticipation of the inevitable doom that awaits them. The film's antagonist, Cropsy, is a standout villain. His grotesque appearance and sadistic nature make him an unforgettable presence on screen. The creative team behind \"The Burning\" expertly uses shadow and lighting to enhance the suspense, ensuring that every encounter with Cropsy is a heart-pounding experience. One of the most memorable aspects of this film is the impressive practical effects. The kills are gruesome, yet strangely satisfying to watch. The practical effects team deserves applause for their attention to detail, making each death scene uniquely horrifying. \"The Burning\" also benefits from a dynamic and energetic score that adds an extra layer of intensity to the on-screen events. The music perfectly complements the action, heightening the overall viewing experience. In conclusion, \"The Burning\" is a horror classic that deserves recognition for its well-crafted storytelling, memorable characters, and impressive practical effects.

{"original_text": "The movie had so much potential, but it fell short in delivering a truly captivating story. The performances by the cast were commendable, especially Sean Penn's portrayal of the charismatic and corrupt politician, Willie Stark. However, even the exceptional acting couldn't compensate for the lackluster screenplay and direction. The plot seemed promising at first, following the rise and fall of Stark as he manipulates his way into power. The film attempted to explore themes of morality, corruption, and the consequences of unchecked ambition. Unfortunately, the execution felt disjointed, with several subplots that didn't quite tie together seamlessly. One of the major drawbacks was the pacing. The movie seemed to drag on at times, making it difficult to stay fully engaged. Additionally, some scenes and dialogue felt forced, lacking the authenticity needed to truly connect with the audience. It was disappointing because the source material, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Robert Penn Warren, was known for its rich and complex narrative.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Based on the best-selling novel by Robert Penn Warren, the film follows the rise and fall of one of the most powerful politicians in the United States, Willie Stark, as he attempts to regain power after a scandal involving his brother, Bobby Stark, who is also a politician, and his wife, Mary Jo, who are both played by Meryl Streep and Kate Winslet.

(Instead of Walsh we get Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart we get Jack Palance, for Ida Lupino Shelley Winters, and so on down through the credits.) The only change is that, this time, instead of black-and-white, it's in Warnercolor; sadly, there are those who would count this an improvement.I Died A Thousand Times may be unnecessary \u0096 and inferior \u0096 but at least it's not a travesty; the story still works on its own stagy terms. Earle (Palance), fresh out of the pen near Chicago, drives west to spearhead a big job masterminded by ailing kingpin Lon Chaney, Jr. \u0096 knocking over a post mountain resort. En route, he almost collides with a family of Oakies, when he's smitten with their granddaughter; the smiting holds even when he discovers she's lame. Arriving at the cabins where the rest of gang holes up, he finds amateurish hotheads at one another's throats as well as Winters, who throws herself at him (as does the pooch).

Then, the surgical strike against the resort turns into a bloodbath.

Britain's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role, which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing.

{"original_text": "Lee Chang-dong's exceptional \"Secret Sunshine\" is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year. It is an instantly sobering, brutally honest character piece on the reverberations of loss and a graceful memento mori that resonates with a striking density of thought, yet remains as inscrutable as the emotions it observes. Through its layered naturalism and stunningly trenchant view of small-town dynamics, Lee implicitly deconstructs the traditional Korean melodrama by pulling apart the cinematics of excess and ripping to shreds the arcs that shape its characters and grounds the proceedings into a crushing grind of stoic realism.\"Secret Sunshine\" remains an immensely compelling, fluid work throughout its 142-minute runtime. Its bravura first hour is filled to the brim with subtextual insinuations, remarkable foreshadowing and adroit reversals of tone brought about by humanistic capriciousness. Adapted from a short story, Lee infuses the film with his sensitivity for the sublime paradoxes of life, last seen in his transgressively comic and irreverent \"Oasis\". Understanding how personal revolutions are forged when views of our universe are changed, Lee not only sees the emotional cataclysm of a widow's sorrow through an inquiring scope but also feels the tumultuous existential currents that underpin the film when religion becomes a narrative scapegoat in comprehending the heinousness of the human experience.Do-yeon Jeon's (\"You Are My Sunshine\") Best Actress accolade at Cannes in 2007 is well deserved. Her performance as the widow Shin-ae remains an unrelenting enigma. As a character pulled apart by forces beyond her control, the sheer magnificence of this performance is central to the film's turbulent nature. With Jeon essaying one cyclonic upheaval after another, there's a tremulous sense of collapse that the film, to its credit, never approaches. Instead it finds a delicate balance that saps the charged theatricality and subsequent banality from ordinary tragedies and its fallouts. She becomes the centre of the film's universe as well as ours. Filmed in glorious hand-held CinemaScope, the film demolishes the cinematicism of frames and compositions by becoming visually acute just as it is quietly harrowing when the camera never relinquishes its gaze from Shin-ae through times of happiness, guilt and remorse.Lee captures the details of life in the small, suspicious town of Miryang \u0096 the awkwardness of communal situations, its uncomfortable silences and its devastations spun out of personal dramas. Shin-ae's interactions with the townsfolk rarely inspires dividends, especially when they are merely done out of obligation to fit in for the sake of her son, Jun (Seon Jung-yeop). The one recurring acquaintance is Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho), a bachelor mechanic of uncertain intentions who helps her en route to Miryang in the film's enchanting open sequence set to a captivating stream of sunlight. Song has situated himself as a comedic anti-hero in South Korea's biggest films but his nuanced, low-key delivery here purports the director's thought process of never having to reveal more than plainly necessary.If pain is ephemeral, then grief can never truly dissipate. And Lee finds complexity in subsistence. When Shin-ae attempts to head down the path of reconciliation only to be faced again with unimaginable heartbreak, she unsuccessfully employs the fellowship of evangelical Christianity as a foil to her sorrow. But Lee knows better than that when he understands that religion, in the context of the human canvas of strife and misery, is never a simple solution. But Lee never rebukes the essence of religion as he realises the value of salvation for some through a higher power even if it serves a form of denial in others. The scenes in its latter half which deal with religion doesn't allow itself to become aggressively scornful, which is a feat in itself considering how many filmmakers let the momentum of the material take over from what they need to say to be true to its story and characters.Lee's first film since his call to office as his country's Minister of Culture and Tourism is an uncompromising dissertation on human suffering. In a film so artless and genuine, it arduously reveals that there's nothing as simple as emotional catharsis, just the suppression and abatement of agony. \"Secret Sunshine\" leaves us with tender mercies pulled out of evanescence, and points towards a profound understanding of despair and faith.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Lee Chang-dong's exceptional \"Secret Sunshine\" is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year.

{"original_text": "\"Intolerance\" is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends time and leaves its audience in awe. Director D.W. Griffith takes us on an epic journey through different eras, intertwining four captivating stories to showcase the destructive power of intolerance. This groundbreaking film challenges societal norms, shedding light on the consequences of prejudice and discrimination. The sheer scale of \"Intolerance\" is mind-boggling, with its grand sets and breathtaking cinematography. Griffith's attention to detail is impeccable, capturing the essence of each era flawlessly. From ancient Babylon to modern-day America, the production design is a visual feast, immersing us in the world of each story. The performances are equally impressive, with a talented ensemble cast that brings emotional depth to their characters. Lillian Gish's portrayal of the young woman in the modern story is particularly moving, as she embodies innocence and resilience in the face of adversity. What sets \"Intolerance\" apart is its powerful message. By juxtaposing different time periods, Griffith emphasizes the cyclical nature of intolerance throughout history. It serves as a stark reminder that the consequences of prejudice are far-reaching and devastating. Furthermore, the film's editing techniques are revolutionary for its time. Griffith masterfully intercuts between the four narratives, building tension and creating a sense of urgency. This innovative approach keeps the audience engaged and adds an extra layer of suspense. \"Intolerance\" is a true work of art that continues to resonate today. Its exploration of intolerance is as relevant now as it was back in 1916.

The actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available. Swayzee is really NOT a Quatermain character at all. After seeing Sean Connery's interpretation of the great man in \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\", Swayzee really does not make the grade. This chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength, stature, subtlety, or humour needed for the part, and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor, who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast. Some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography. For example. When the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert, their tracks are visible down to the oasis, just waiting for them to walk in them.

Cinderella was a perfect return to the full-length feature animation film (as opposed to the compilation films of the 40's), and expensive depth via the multi-plane camera returns to the film in no other way. Although Disney adapts the story somewhat liberally, you gather the idea of the era via the dress and set stylizations---a clear time period the story takes place.Cinderella is more mature than Snow White, and a multi-dimensional character. Actually, all of the characters are somewhat well-developed, except for the Prince--left the most flat--we know he has a sense of humor, and a great smile, but that's about all. Like Snow White, Disney has some permanent impact on the story in popular culture---in most versions of Cinderella, the stepsisters are attractive, just not as pretty as Cinderella, and their character takes away from their otherwise nice appearance.Favorite Disney additions: the mice! Also, appreciated the continuity--Cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film. The addition of the homemade gown as well as the following assault from the stepsisters was always horrific as a child--I remember View Master showing this with a black background and a large red light on it! The broken slipper shows the unwillingness of evil Lady Tremaine to give up her hold over Cinderella and admit defeat---Audley would go on to characterize the most wicked of all Disney villains, satanic witch Maleficent, in Sleeping Beauty.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This is one of Disney's top five animated features, in my opinion.

The guys took the time to give full descriptions of all the specials and all of them sounded amazing! Our app came out quickly and was a shareable size.

Honestly, because Jim Carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter, so do you really blame me for expecting that again?

I admit that maybe it is wrong to judge Jim Carrey on his previous films, but what does he really expect when he makes Gem's such as'The Truman Show','Liar Liar','Me, Myself and Irene','Dumb and Dumber','The Mask', and the'Ace Ventura' films then produces, in Bruce Nolan's own words, such a mediocre film?Reason 2: Jennifer Aniston's role was criminally underwritten. I mean hello! She's been around in the public eye for about ten years now, and in this film she gets about four lines to say. Wrong.Reason 3: One word - Clich\u00e9Reason 4: A casual deployment of specifically American References - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite'sweeps week' - is a clue to the film's specifically home-grown appeal. \"A teenager says no to drugs and yes to an Education - that's a miracle!

In Dr. Strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation, and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments.

The cues Nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness, which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son. The environment that he is in, however, then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness. In much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there, the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man, and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return. He may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives, but to me the Overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off.Kubrick's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film, and the unpredictable force of nature that is Jack Nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you.

{"original_text": "\"Prince of Darkness\" is a chilling and atmospheric horror film that delves into the realms of science and religion, delivering a unique and unsettling experience. Directed by master of horror, John Carpenter, this film explores the concept of evil through a sinister and mysterious ancient artifact discovered by a group of scientists. Carpenter masterfully builds tension and suspense throughout the film, creating an eerie and foreboding atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The slow-burning narrative gradually unravels the dark secrets of the artifact, delving into themes of possession, fear, and the blurred lines between science and the supernatural. The standout performances from the cast, particularly Donald Pleasence and Jameson Parker, bring depth and authenticity to their characters, adding an extra layer of believability to the unfolding terror. The cinematography, with its dimly lit corridors and claustrophobic settings, enhances the sense of impending doom, while the haunting musical score by Carpenter himself intensifies the unease. What sets \"Prince of Darkness\" apart from other horror films is its thought-provoking exploration of the nature of evil and the human psyche. It raises compelling questions about the origins of evil and the inherent darkness that lies within us all. Carpenter's skillful storytelling keeps the audience engaged, and the shocking climax leaves a lasting impact.

{"original_text": "To bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as Braveheart. Though it is a very different kind of film, the conflict between Scottish commoners and English nobility is front and center here as well. Roughly 400 years had passed between the time Braveheart took place and Rob Roy was set, but some things never seemed to change. Scottland is still run by English nobles, and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them. Rob Roy is handsomely done, but not the grand epic that Braveheart was. There are no large-scale battles, and the conflict here is more between individuals. And helpfully so not all Englishmen are portrayed as evil this time. Rob Roy is simply a film about those with honor, and those who are truly evil.Liam Neeson plays the title character Rob Roy MacGregor. He is the leader of the MacGregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the Marquis of Montrose (John Hurt). Things look pretty rough for the MacGregor clan as winter is approaching, and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone. Rob Roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the Marquis and purchase some cattle of his own. He would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community. Sounds fair enough, doesn't it? Problems arise when two cronies of the Marquis steal the money for themselves. One of them, known as Archibald Cunningham, is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film. Played wonderfully by Tim Roth, this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the Marquis by his mother. This man is disgustingly effeminate, rude, heartless, and very dangerous with a sword. He fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility. He rapes Macgregor's wife and burns him out of his home. This guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come. Along with another crony of the Marquis (Brian Cox) Cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts. Though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened, the Marquis still holds MacGregor to the debt. This sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity.Spoilers ahead!!!!!Luckily for the MacGregor's, a Duke who is no friend to the Marquis sets up a final duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all. This sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed. Cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace. And for most of the fight, it looks like these attributes will win out. Just when it looks like Rob Roy is finished, he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner. The first time you see what happens, you will probably be as shocked as Cunningham! Rob Roy is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and perfectly paced. The score is quite memorable, too. The casting choices seem to have worked out as Jessica Lange, who might seem to be out of her element, actually turns in one of the strongest performances as Mary MacGregor. The film is violent, but there isn't too much gore. It is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior, however. The nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy. The film has no obvious flaws, thus it gets 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "To bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as Braveheart.

{"original_text": "I wasted my time watching it. The movie lacked depth and substance, leaving me disappointed and unsatisfied. The plot felt predictable and formulaic, with little room for character development or meaningful storytelling. The acting was subpar, with exaggerated performances that bordered on cheesy. The dialogues felt forced and unnatural, failing to evoke any genuine emotions or connection with the audience. It was filled with over-the-top action sequences that seemed more concerned with flashy visuals than with telling a compelling story. Additionally, the special effects and production design were dated, making the film feel like a relic from a bygone era. The costumes and set designs were tacky and overdone, contributing to the overall unpleasant viewing experience.

{"original_text": "Since starting to read the book this movie is based on, I'm having mixed feelings about the filmed result. I learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before I read the book, because I found that if I read the book first I was inevitably disappointed in the film. This would undoubtedly have been true here, whereas in the case of Atonement, which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book I've ever seen, it would probably not have mattered.I'm trying to figure out what the cause is, and I suspect that I have to point my finger squarely at Michael Cunningham. Much as I respect him for The Hours (which I have not read but which I saw and was awed by) I cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted Susan Minton's book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it.It's not that I dislike the movie. I actually love the movie, which is why, since I started reading the novel, I'm feeling disturbed about the whole thing. I feel disloyal to Ms. Minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work. Reading it, I can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it. Unlike what one reviewer of the movie said, it's not so much that some novels don't deserve to be a movie; it's more like some books just can't make the transition. Ms. Minton's novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character, so internally, that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm. Even though a lot of the book is memory of real events, it is memory, and so fragmented and ethereal as to be, I feel, not filmable. I think that Ms. Minton's work is a real work of literature, but cannot make the transition to film, which in no way detracts from its value.I cannot yet report that Evening, the film, does not represent Evening, the novel, in any more than the most superficial way, since I'm only halfway through, but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point. I guess I'm writing this because I feel that if you're going to adapt a novel, adapt it, but don't make it something else that it's not. I'm not sure if Michael Cunningham has done anything wholly original, but from what I can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else's work. We would not have The Hours if Virginia Woolf had not written Mrs. Dalloway, and we would not have Evening, in its distressed form, if Susan Minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place. But it's too much to say that it would be better if Ms. Minton had left well enough alone, because Evening, the film, is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own.Thus my confusion, mixed feelings, sense of disloyalty, and ultimate conclusion that, in this case, the novel cannot be the film and vice versa, and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did, so that we have both works as they are.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Since starting to read the book this movie is based on, I'm having mixed feelings about the filmed result.

Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost. We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese. These were denser than typical Paneer. The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good. Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal. I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh. Regardless, it was tasty. Entrees included Paneer Bhurji and Lamb Shahi Korma. We elected \"spicy\" as our seasoning level. I'll admit, I have a pretty strong ability to deal with spiciness. But this was some ultra-spicy food when it arrived! We quickly ordered a mango lassi to help put out the fire. Still, even through the spices, there were decent flavors coming through. The nutiness of the Korma was especially nice, as was the blended creaminess. I'm intrigued enough to return for more offerings.

Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost. We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese. These were denser than typical Paneer. The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good. Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal. I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh. Regardless, it was tasty. Entrees included Paneer Bhurji and Lamb Shahi Korma. We elected \"spicy\" as our seasoning level. I'll admit, I have a pretty strong ability to deal with spiciness. But this was some ultra-spicy food when it arrived! We quickly ordered a mango lassi to help put out the fire. Still, even through the spices, there were decent flavors coming through. The nutiness of the Korma was especially nice, as was the blended creaminess. I'm intrigued enough to return for more offerings. I am humbled however by their spiciness--something that has not happened to me in many many years. Next time, I am going to stick with \"medium\" spiciness!"}

{"original_text": "PROM NIGHT (2008)directed by: Nelson McCormickstarring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davisplot: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (Jonathan Schaech) who has a bit of a crush on her. Now, she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends. Once there, they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn Donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt. pros: I got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves.An example:Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her (she doesn't seem that great) has escaped from prison. Their reason: They don't want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. LOLcons: Let me start off by saying I'm a huge slasher fan. Usually I can have fun with even the bad ones. I even like some PG-13 horror films. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also enjoy POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated PG-13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie.First of all, I had a big problem with the story. I like slasher films that don't even have stories. At least they can be entertaining. This is about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills her entire family. A few years later, he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends...? Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone cared about. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and I couldn't care less. This should have been a Lifetime feature, not a remake of PROM NIGHT. And then.... this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes. I don't even care that it's not that gory, some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) were not that gory but they still had effective murders. Here, we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen, a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds, and a closeup on a bad actor's face as he screams in agony. I'm sure that 10 year-old girls were terrified, but not me.I also hated the characters. There was Donna's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life, unless you are a gay male. Then we had Donna's annoying friends Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the token mean girl Chrissy (Brianne Davis). If you thought the characters in DEATH PROOF were annoying, try watching this movie. And don't get me started on Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and the DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me flashbacks to Usher's performance in SHE'S ALL THAT.Add to all that predictable plot turns, a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material, and you have quite a stinker.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "PROM NIGHT (2008)directed by: Nelson McCormickstarring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davisplot: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (Jonathan Schaech) who has a bit of a crush on her.

But when my friends suggested to meet them here for brunch this past weekend, I trusted their better judgement. In the end, I'm glad I did. This cozy Center City spot not only serves an amazing (and dare I say, a contender for the best) brunch in Philly, the staff really make you feel at home. They really know how to wow their patrons: fresh food, delightful presentation, and so many delicious sounding choices it's hard to choose which dish you want from their one page menu for mains. Their specialty, and they're not shy to tell you, is the Cyprus Breakfast. It's a mediterranean twist on the classic combination of eggs, meat, and starch. The plate comes out with two sunny-side up eggs, fried in olive oil and garnished with fresh parsely. It's served alongside a grilled slice of lounza (Greek ham), two pieces of salty, crisp fried halloumi, warm bread, and tomato, cucumber, and onion salad. The menu also features a spread of other traditional Greek, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern specialities: Avgolemono, Moussaka, Pastitsio, Shaksouka, and Malohwa to name a few. They even serve Greek Coffee and Frappes! The service may be a little over-attentive in an attempt to make you feel more than welcome, but it's much appreciated, especially when other restaurants fail to put as much effort into the service as they do the food. One other tip: reservations are highly recommended, if not required. Because of Kanella's small space, getting a table at brunch is nearly impossible if you're not on the list.

{"original_text": "Okay, the recent history of Star Trek has not been good. The Next Generation faded in its last few seasons, DS9 boldly stayed where no one had stayed before, and Voyager started very bad and never really lived up to its promise. So, when they announced a new Star Trek series, I did not have high expectations. And, the first episode, Broken Bow, did have some problems. But, overall it was solid Trek material and a good romp.I'll get the nits out of the way first. The opening theme is dull and I don't look forward to sitting through it regularly, but that's what remotes are for. What was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room. They need to cut that nonsense out.But, the plot was strong and moved along well. The characters, though still new, seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect. The Vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before, with a slightly ominous theme. I particularly liked the linguist, who is the first Star Trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death, but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears. They seemed to stay true to Trek lore, something that has been a significant problem in past series, though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields, the instant invention of technology that can fix anything, and the inevitable plethora of time-travel stories. Anyone want to start a pool on how long before the Borg show up?All in all, the series has enormous potential. They are seeing the universe with fresh eyes. We have the chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series. How did the Klingons go from just insulting to war? How did we meet the Romulans?

They've since replaced it with a menu that isn't even worth ordering off of. They regularly had specials of sandwiches, wraps, and salads on the lunch menu for under $7 that came with chips/fries and a drink. All but one item on the menu includes a drink now and I just paid $9.01 for a buffalo chicken wrap, tiny bag of chips, and soda I had to buy separately. Whoever made it must have missed the memo on how to assemble it because it didn't have the crisp lettuce and tomato inside of mine that was stated on the menu. I got a $9 wheat wrap stuffed with a pathetic amount of chicken and nothing else. It was smaller than the premade Wawa wraps. Huge change in what Gaetano's used to be, their portion sizes were always their strong point. I posted a picture a while ago of a meatball sandwich lunch special I got before they started cheaping out on their offerings.

We went in, she told us that the previous party has been sitting there for a while and would be done at any minuet. She also told us that we would be the next people to sit down. We thought, great! since they were putting on their coats and getting ready to leave. After the staff was finished cleaning up the dishes from the table, the host sat down A PARTY OF THREE PEOPLE. that also, CAME AFTER US!!! I just don't get it. There were plenty of other tables available, so why sit a party of 3 at the only table that can comfortably sit 8?

On saturday I went with a group of 7 people. Since Honeys is one of our favorite places to get brunch, we knew that we would have to wait up to an hour for a table. Since they have such good food, it's worth it. But this is why I'm no longer going to go there, and the reason for the two star rating: The hostess was horrible. There is only ONE table that can seat up to 8 people. We went in, she told us that the previous party has been sitting there for a while and would be done at any minuet. She also told us that we would be the next people to sit down. We thought, great! since they were putting on their coats and getting ready to leave. After the staff was finished cleaning up the dishes from the table, the host sat down A PARTY OF THREE PEOPLE. that also, CAME AFTER US!!! I just don't get it. There were plenty of other tables available, so why sit a party of 3 at the only table that can comfortably sit 8? I understand going to Honey's with a party of 7 isnt the smartest idea, but when the hostess tells us that we would be next in line for that large table,and then sits 3 people, that is the dumbest thing ever. Needless to say,I am never going there again. They blew it, they lost our business. we left and ate at the foodery on 837 N 2nd St."}

However, considering that the movie was released in 2010, I understand that the technology has advanced significantly since then. Despite this, I still found the story captivating and the action sequences were well-executed. The film follows the story of Perseus, a demigod who embarks on a dangerous quest to stop the vengeful god Hades from unleashing his wrath upon mankind. The plot is filled with Greek mythology, epic battles, and larger-than-life creatures that kept me engaged throughout. One of the highlights of \"Clash of the Titans\" was the impressive ensemble cast.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "\"Clash of the Titans\" is one of my all-time favourite movies, but it did not live up to the expectations that I had set for it when I first saw it a few years ago.

{"original_text": "The Man from Snowy River II doesn't reinvent the wheel but is a crowd-pleasing beautiful film that hits some great notes.For those fans wanting the elements that made the original Man From Snowy River film a hit, (breathtaking scenery, sweeping score, sweet romanticism and cracking action) this film really delivers. This story picks up a few years from the end of the first, Jim (Tom Burlinson) has been away gathering his fortune in a brood of stock horses. He returns to pick up where he left off with his pluckish well-bred sweetheart Jessica (played by Aussie divine lady Sigrid Thornton) who is still attempting to break out of her corseted upbringing on her feather's cattle station (Harrison is now played by American Brian Dennehy). The foil to Jim and character that shakes the plot is the well-to-do upper class snob Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie) who has his sights on Jessica. Add to the mix some social tension surrounding landholdings and the stallion with a bad attitude from the first film and that's the plot.The best thing about this film is the acting. Tom Burlinson fits snugly into Jim's wide brim hat and laconic humour. Sigrid Thornton is a lovely heroine and the two manage some real chemistry on screen. Filling the solid shoes of Kirk Douglas was never going to be easy and Brian Dennehy stomps and shouts but never feels very authentic in this part.The music is sweeping and lush and the cinematography could be a roll from a Victoria tourism reel. There are moment however that feel very self-indulgent, like the director wants just one more helicopter shot of the riders to show how gorgeous the landscape is without some personal human drama. A little more grit would have sufficed here, we are Aussie's, we can take it!! There are some very JAWSish moments with the stallion that defy belief. However the funny thing about this film is that in amongst some glaring clich\u00e9s, there are some really inventive and touching scenes. Jim putting the saddle on the stallion (VERY Horse Whisperish before its time) Jim and Jessica setting up home, the fabulous scene where Jim shows up Alistair's riding with his trusty whip. I can see why this character is such an icon.Altogether a very pleasing sequel. Here's hoping everyone involved wants to make another. the Man From Snowy River III: The CRAIGS.

While it had all the elements of a compelling story - the clash of cultures, the exploration of racism and prejudice, and the examination of personal relationships - it somehow fell short in its execution. The film lacked the depth and emotional complexity that the book beautifully portrayed. The characters, who were so vividly drawn in E.M. Forster's novel, felt shallow and one-dimensional on screen. Their motivations and inner struggles were glossed over, leaving the audience disconnected and uninvested in their fates. Furthermore, the cinematography and direction, though visually stunning at times, failed to create a sense of atmosphere and evoke the rich setting of colonial India.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "The ambiguities of Forster's novel, The Shipping Forecast, were exploited by the film's makers in order to make the story seem more \"linear\" and \"linear-ish\" than it really was, leaving the audience feeling like they were watching a one-trick pony, rather than a fully-realised account of life in India in the 19th Century."}

{"original_text": "In a nutshell: These guys are awesome to deal with. They came on time; They worked their butts off until the job was done; They were very tidy and considerate of my property; and I got exactly what was promised at a fair price. The Details: When my A/C went on a hot summer day I thought ugh, I wish I knew someone in the field. I didn't, so I started reading reviews and calling around. The main HVAC repair companies around town came across as contractors (middlemen) that would just end up costing me more money in the end. I knew what I wanted. I wanted to deal directly with the guy who was going to do the work. Someone who cared about customer satisfaction. Someone I could trust. I found all those things and more when I spoke to Ray, the owner and operator of Trust Home Comfort. When I read some of the reviews on the competition, it seemed that the biggest frustration out there were people who were charged a couple hundred of dollars to get a guy out, only to be told that their old A/C was not worth repairing. I didn't want that to happen to me, so I took the unorthodox approach of taking a brief video of my problem and posting it to YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iMHhimCqUo. This will be great, I thought. Saves everyone time, and hopefully me some money. Right? Wishful thinking, none of the big companies were even willing to look at the video. So I kept calling around. Eventually, I got a hold of Van (the office guy) at Trust Home Comfort. He was great! He said \"Sure, we'll have a look at the video\", so I emailed him the link with some photos of my system. I heard back a short time later from the owner of the company, Ray, who is a journeyman HVAC technician with a 4 year degree in Refrigeration Technology. Ray told me straight up that he didn't think the problem was what I was hoping it would be (a low cost contactor part), but in order to know for sure he would have to come out and run a diagnostic. They both reassured me that if I had to replace the entire system, I wouldn't be charged for the service call AND a new system. When Ray (the owner/technician) arrived the next day he took his electronic meter measurements, and was able to confirm that my compressor was shot. I would need a new system. We sat down to discussed my options. Ray was very honest and forthright about which system would be best for me. He took his time and shared his experience about what other customers have liked. No high pressure sales. No lies about pricing. Just the straight honest goods you would expect from a technician. I loved that. We ended up upgrading our HVAC system to one of the new units that is VERY quite and comes with a 10 year parts warranty. I think my neighbor was especially pleased with the \"quite\" part. Ray was even willing to do the job on a long weekend, even though he planned on taking it off. At the end of the day, we got a new \"Green\" A/C unit, a new updated humidifier, and a new WiFi thermostat which I can control from anywhere in the world through my iPhone.

I didn't want that to happen to me, so I took the unorthodox approach of taking a brief video of my problem and posting it to YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iMHhimCqUo. This will be great, I thought. Saves everyone time, and hopefully me some money. Right? Wishful thinking, none of the big companies were even willing to look at the video. So I kept calling around. Eventually, I got a hold of Van (the office guy) at Trust Home Comfort. He was great! He said \"Sure, we'll have a look at the video\", so I emailed him the link with some photos of my system. I heard back a short time later from the owner of the company, Ray, who is a journeyman HVAC technician with a 4 year degree in Refrigeration Technology. Ray told me straight up that he didn't think the problem was what I was hoping it would be (a low cost contactor part), but in order to know for sure he would have to come out and run a diagnostic. They both reassured me that if I had to replace the entire system, I wouldn't be charged for the service call AND a new system. When Ray (the owner/technician) arrived the next day he took his electronic meter measurements, and was able to confirm that my compressor was shot. I would need a new system. We sat down to discussed my options. Ray was very honest and forthright about which system would be best for me. He took his time and shared his experience about what other customers have liked. No high pressure sales. No lies about pricing. Just the straight honest goods you would expect from a technician. I loved that. We ended up upgrading our HVAC system to one of the new units that is VERY quite and comes with a 10 year parts warranty. I think my neighbor was especially pleased with the \"quite\" part. Ray was even willing to do the job on a long weekend, even though he planned on taking it off. At the end of the day, we got a new \"Green\" A/C unit, a new updated humidifier, and a new WiFi thermostat which I can control from anywhere in the world through my iPhone. All for a very reasonable price. Very cool."}

{"original_text": "My Comments for VIVAH:- Its a charming, idealistic love story starring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom's families sleeping on the floor, playing games together, their friendly banter and mutual respect. Vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals. Yes, the central romance is naively visualized. But the sneaked-in romantic moments between the to-be-married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism. The film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom, on the wedding night, tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries: \"Come let me do your dressing\"V I V A H - showcases a lot of good things - beauty of arranged marriage, beauty of Indian culture, beauty of Indian woman, last but not least a nice IDEALISM of the about-to-be-couple waiting to get married..... playing by the rules! Simple yet Beautiful; Such a Simple story..... no plot.... no villain - as is the case with most of Sooraj Barjatya films. Sooraj sir is back to what he does BEST. He has made the movie with FULL CONVICTION. Its a very sweet film - which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout Arranged Marriage & the Union of 2 Families. I think AMRITA RAO - looks very good & she has acted very well. She has most of the good scenes - although I thought the last half hour was completely to Shahid Kapur - who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance. I also liked the acting of all others for ex. the Choti i.e. Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, Shahid's bro & sis-in-law. It almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could. Sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain. The chemistry between Shahid & Amrita is AWESOME.Stuff like Sanctity in a Marriage/Relationship, Avoiding Courtship, Mutual Respect, Care & Space, Waiting for getting Married \"officially\", Praying/Sacrficing for Ur Beloved - all these and more get SHOWCASED in Vivah. There's still some good audience who r going & enjoying this film. Some of the folks/audience are already excited after seeing, that they r thinking bout Arranged-Marriage:) Thats Success if you ask me. it seems AMRITA RAO - our actress-from-Vivah {Result for a nice performance} has been bestowed the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE award for 2006!! Hats off to her for this achievement Chalo, even though Vivah, Shahid or Amrita didn't get any of the film-fare & other awards; @ least this is news to CHEER about!! Congrats to AMRITA RAO- for showing us a visual of Indian Bride-to-be in the purest form and Of Course to Sooraj Barjatya for portraying her the best way:) Shudn't forget Shahid Kapur and all others who make VIVAH as sweet and legendary as it is today!! Imagine, to share the same pedestal as the legendary Dilip Kumar........... Its no mean achievement!! Congrats to Amrita Rao - for taking her Career to another level with this award..... I personally feel - she should keep doing movies only with Shahid Kapur!! They make a cute couple and their on-screen chemistry reminds me of {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla}.................. Some points that I observed,few of the elements:- #1 If u notice carefully, Amrita Rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses. She gives every bit of the Indian Woman essence - in this film!! Perfect Fit #2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us - not exactly ready for marriage or early-marriage..... but PREM listens carefully to the step-wise talk given by his DAD - having full faith in Anupam Kher. Eventually \"Honesty\" & \"Trust\" are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with Amrita. Most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person. But according to what I saw in this film, I have a feeling - that Two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also, Its possible!!! #3 In the entire movie - there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where Shahid & Amrita are together - or shown to be together. Its unlike most other romantic/wedding-based movies where Hero & Heroine are always singing/dancing or nowadays - doing cheap stuff. But the beauty of each of these 5 sequences:- Characterized by restraint, innocence & respect for the other! #4 I really liked the relationship shown between Chacha ALOK NATH & Amrita Rao. These kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters/girl-kids in some parts of India. #5 Romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely - no cheap scenes,songs are beautifully pictured!! Words like \"Jal\",\"praarthana\" e.t.c. are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film:) Personally, I really am fond of many dialogs in this film. #6 Last but not the least - The entire Hospital Scene where Shahid puts \"sindhoor\" to Amrita when shes struggling for Life - is terrific. Those dialogs between the couple are so touching and U feel the LOVE/I-cant-do-without-U; Its a Hats-Off feeling!!! *** In many ways, VIVAH reminded me of Maine Pyar Kiya, DDLJ, Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - for the freshness/on-screen-chemistry of the LEAD pair:):) *** IF U ASK ME:- Along with films like Rang De Basanti, Lage Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE and Kabul Express, V I V A H ranks among the best films made in 2006.

{"original_text": "\"New York, New York\" is a cinematic masterpiece that takes you on a whirlwind journey through the vibrant and unpredictable streets of the Big Apple. Directed by Martin Scorsese, this film is a love letter to the city that never sleeps, capturing its essence with breathtaking cinematography and a compelling storyline. The film follows the lives of Jimmy Doyle (Robert De Niro), a talented saxophonist with dreams of stardom, and Francine Evans (Liza Minnelli), a talented singer who yearns for success. As their paths intertwine, their tumultuous relationship becomes the heart and soul of the movie. What truly sets \"New York, New York\" apart is its authentic portrayal of the music industry during the 1940s and 1950s. The performances are electrifying, transporting you to a bygone era of jazz clubs and big band orchestras. De Niro and Minnelli's chemistry is palpable, and their musical numbers are nothing short of spectacular. Scorsese's attention to detail is remarkable, as he recreates the glamorous and gritty atmosphere of old New York. The sets and costumes are meticulously crafted, immersing you in a world of vintage charm and nostalgia. The film's visuals are further enhanced by a remarkable score, which flawlessly blends original compositions with classic jazz standards. While \"New York, New York\" may not be as well-known as some of Scorsese's other works, it is undeniably a hidden gem that deserves recognition.

{"original_text": "I didn't think it could be done, but something has come along and replaced Open House- a low budget horror about someone killing over the high price of real estate- as the worst film I've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet life.It was touted as the best film in Montreal's most recent film festival, which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of blank-wall shots accompanied by people reading gloomy poetry.Watching this movie was like a little slice of Hell. It's from Austria, and it attempts to stumble along in the footsteps of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet- scenes about various characters living in a suburban area with a dark underbelly. There's the fat dog owner and his fat maid wife who stripteases for him, the skinny divorcee whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the untouched room of his dead child, the \u00fcber-annoying woman hitchhiker who recites top ten lists....

I couldn't say if they were any good as actors, as, according to the subtitles, they were given lines that were the Austrian equivalent of \"You are so lame!\" They certainly didn't have to learn many, as each repeated his or her same lines at least three times in a scene.This is no Gummo, or any of the aforementioned movies. There is no art to discover, and nothing to dwell on afterwards except maybe whether or not you should change your \"never walk out during a movie\" policy (which quite a few older couples did during a random orgy scene- and if that sounds appetizing, it's not, unless you're one of few who doesn't find the idea of your parents having sex- and with a few local middle-aged couples, to boot- revolting).This movie was offensive to me. Not the flabby nudity, not the cringe-inducing soundtrack, not the shockless scenes involving guns. I was offended that someone actually spent money to make this when there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding. I was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see Dog Days and come out wondering if that was the best us Montrealers could find. Most of all, I was offended that, somehow, the people involved with the festival duped everyone into believing that the emperor had a gorgeous and mesmerising new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat maid wife doing a striptease.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I didn't think it could be done, but something has come along and replaced Open House- a low budget horror about someone killing over the high price of real estate- as the worst film I've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet life.It was touted as the best film in Montreal's most recent film festival, which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of blank-wall shots accompanied by people reading gloomy poetry.Watching this movie was like a little slice of Hell.

Not the flabby nudity, not the cringe-inducing soundtrack, not the shockless scenes involving guns. I was offended that someone actually spent money to make this when there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding. I was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see Dog Days and come out wondering if that was the best us Montrealers could find. Most of all, I was offended that, somehow, the people involved with the festival duped everyone into believing that the emperor had a gorgeous and mesmerising new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat maid wife doing a striptease."}

{"original_text": "If, like me, you like your films to be unique, and unlike the majority of other movies, then I wholly recommend that you check out The Beast. The film is a grotesque, erotic, fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological'Beast' that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a French mansion and lusts after women. The film is very daring with it's subject material, and that is something to give it credit for. The theme of bestiality is a definite taboo, and for good reason, I might add; but the film conveys it; straight and to the point. Like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre, The Beast could have gone around it, and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps, but Borowczyk didn't do that, and he is brave in that respect, especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms, but the fact that he went ahead with it, in my view, means a big thumbs up for the guy.The film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female. This opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience, in some ways, for the incredible, tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see. The scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking, and are bound to offend many people (hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years), but these scenes are not merely an excuse for Borowczyk to shock the viewer; this film has a defining point. As said during the film; the only difference between man and beast is intelligence. Both man and beast have instincts, only man knows how to control them. The Beast explores this difference between man and beast through sexuality; the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears epitomises the control of human desire, and it is only when the central female character lets go of her control that she can see the beast. The film has strong themes of the age-old story of'beauty and beast' weaved into it, and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust, but not without a moral.Many criticise the scenes around the film's shocking sex sequences for being boring, but these scenes are important to the film's story. Without these scenes, we wouldn't get to know the characters or the story of the beast, and, most importantly; the story of'beauty and the beast' would not be able to have it's horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience, and as that is one of the key elements of the film; it would be a real shame. Besides that, Borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes, not with shocks, but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family, along with the beautiful shots of the mansion's ground would not be seen, and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either.Overall, The Beast is a shocking film. It's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone. However, if you can get over the film's shock, and embrace The Beast; what awaits is a skilful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "If, like me, you like your films to be unique, and unlike the majority of other movies, then I wholly recommend that you check out The Beast.

How many viewers understood that the husband agreed, in exchange for substantial financial remuneration, not to return to and reclaim his wife until Oswald was dead?2) The ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental. The original screenplay called for Maria to commit suicide after the reading of Oswald's will, on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide. Maria is then summarily blown up, rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self-delusion and moral compromise.3) Fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private, the political on the personal. Contrary to what the critics and \"experts\" assert, I don't think it works. Merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of German reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama. The selfish ambition of Maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so-called economic miracle of postwar Germany. Maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place, but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific. Women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self-advancement for ages. 4) Lastly, there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness -- Fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect.

Obviously a parody of various zombie movies, most notably Dawn of the Dead, this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead, as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains.Kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he, out of the goodness of his heart, gives a $20 to a homeless man in front of his house. More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park, until the town is completely overrun with them. This is a very strong Randy Marsh episode, as he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the Park County Community Center. But before Randy makes it to the community center, he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming \"I don't have any change!!\" Unfortunately, the refugees end up losing Gerald Broflofski to the homeless, when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town, and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people. Then he becomes one of them, asking everyone for change.The boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park, and find a man who is a director of homeless studies. They find out that the nearby city of Evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless, so they escape to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. Unfortunately, homeless people break into the man's house, and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself. However, he fails several times, as he shoots himself in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder, screaming horribly until he finally dies.

This was not panzanella, it was a field green salad with a few bread cubes in it. Very disappointing since the menu made it sound like a true panzanella.

That's panzanella! How about educating people on what a proper dish is don't dumb it down! We ordered the pizza, one mushroom pizza with truffle oil, that was divine, great crust etc. we also ordered the hot pepper pizza which was disappointing.

{"original_text": "I am amazed at how this movie(and most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on IMDb. The fanboy mentality strikes again. When this movie came out just about everyone slammed it. Even my ex-girlfriend said this movie questionable. Years later I sat down to watch this movie and I found myself enjoying. Even laughing quite a bit. This and The Replacement Killers are the movies that had people labeling the director Antoine Fuqua as the black Michael Bay. I don't see how since most of Fuqua's movies are smarter than anything Michael Bay has came up with. At any rate...Story: Alvin Sanders(Jamie Foxx) is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense Treasury agent Edgar(David Morse) as a pawn to catch a killer named Bristol(Doug Hutchinson). Alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident. While these agents are after Bristol, Bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry.Jamie Foxx is funny as well as great as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on. Doug Hutchinson is okay as Bristol. He can be over-the-top sometimes in his John Malkovitchesque demeanor. He was better here than he was as Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother Stevie. Both him and Jamie had some funny moments on screen.The only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat. The scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but I couldn't look away. The director went all out there so he gets points for that. Plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty.All in all Bait is not a bad movie by a long shot. Its never boring, its always funny and I wasn't checking my watch every minute. That should count for something.

I'm pretty sure you've seen the Die Hard series and EVERY movie by Quentin Tarantino. But those movies aren't violent right? Weirdo.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I am amazed at how this movie(and most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on IMDb. The fanboy mentality strikes again. When this movie came out just about everyone slammed it. Even my ex-girlfriend said this movie questionable. Years later I sat down to watch this movie and I found myself enjoying. Even laughing quite a bit. This and The Replacement Killers are the movies that had people labeling the director Antoine Fuqua as the black Michael Bay. I don't see how since most of Fuqua's movies are smarter than anything Michael Bay has came up with. At any rate...Story: Alvin Sanders(Jamie Foxx) is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense Treasury agent Edgar(David Morse) as a pawn to catch a killer named Bristol(Doug Hutchinson). Alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident. While these agents are after Bristol, Bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry.Jamie Foxx is funny as well as great as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on. Doug Hutchinson is okay as Bristol. He can be over-the-top sometimes in his John Malkovitchesque demeanor. He was better here than he was as Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother Stevie. Both him and Jamie had some funny moments on screen.The only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat. The scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but I couldn't look away. The director went all out there so he gets points for that. Plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty.All in all Bait is not a bad movie by a long shot. Its never boring, its always funny and I wasn't checking my watch every minute. That should count for something.

It is good fun for teenagers, but I think adults won't find much to go on.When In Rome does have its good points. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually quite decent actresses, certainly very pretty as well. I will admit when I was 10 or so, I really liked them, and in general I kind of like them still. And I have enjoyed some of their movies like Passport To Paris and New York Minute. Back on target, both girls don't do that bad a job, in fact they are very appealing. Plus their outfits are to die for, and the scenery of Rome is absolutely breathtaking. The soundtrack ain't half bad either.However, where the film is brought down is in the plot and the script. The script is on the most part clich\u00e9d and has hints of deja vu. The plot, like most of the Mary Kate and Ashley movies, is very predictable, and anyone familiar with any other of the Olsen twins' work, will find some rather unoriginal elements to it. Most of the characters are cardboard thin, and you don't learn very much about them, and sometimes the pace is uneven.

I read reviews prior to arriving so I was prepared to wait. I was still a little surprised at how small this place is. We decided to wait around by the bar. After waiting for roughly 25 minutes, a spot opened up at a sit down counter, adjacent to the bar. For starters, we ordered the pickled red and golden beets along with turnips and black kale from their pickled section. We liked the pickled beets but the turnips and black kale surprisingly where our favorite. The acidity was mild and the black kale was crisp. The toppings I ordered on my burger were Rogue Smokey Bleu, caramelized onions, bacon, and a fried egg. I had high expectations for my burger and I was not disappointed. It was cooked to perfection. I wish I knew what grinds of meet they used to create their burgers because they had the right amount of fat to keep them moist and where full of flavor. I was underwhelmed with the duck fat French fries. They were okay, but nothing exceptional to me. The S'more milk shake was excellent!

The Renaissance was a historical and artistic burst of color and life. How ironic, then, that one of the most bleak and lifeless movies I've seen this year takes its title from the Renaissance."}
{"original_text": "Few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later, yet remain as engrossing as this one. Technological advances have not dated this classic love story. Special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie. The acting is superb. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do an outstanding job. The use of Black and White / Color adds to the creative nature of the movie. It hasn't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence. It is my favorite movie of all time.

{"original_text": "Amy Heckerling's second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of 1930's gangster films made in the Warner Brothers' tradition. Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has continuing health problems, so Keaton falls into crime at an early age via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin, yeah that's right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother turned district attorney, Glynnis O'Connor his wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton's moll. The film looks notoriously cheap, making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film.The film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialog and gags, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery doing his best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious, not funny. Piscopo does the \"once\" bit one time too many. Several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a desk sergeant, and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers. The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film.

{"original_text": "Justifications for what happened to his movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors, drunks and receptionists doing script rewrites aside, let's just take this movie as it's offered, without extraneous explanations.This movie is God awful. Straight up craptastic. Rather than rehash what may serve as a plot, I'll run a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my head.A class (of 5) take a field trip for a history class to the middle of friggin' nowhere Ireland. These students may be Canadian or American, it's difficult to tell. That it was filmed in a Canadian forest rather than Ireland is rather obvious as well. One student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the \"dumb jock\" character from a number of kick ass 80's movie, except when he channels Randy from Scream. One character may be Chris Klein's stunt double. He has a girlfriend who probably gets killed, but it's never really established if that is true. One character is sullen and removed from her peers...just...cuz.... and then there's a blonde girl. Yay blonde girl.Ireland has a population of 2. They're cousins. Gary, who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast, is called \"sir\" more than once. He's very ominous and wears a knit cap. His cousin is a roughed up porn star with the worst Irish accent to befoul film in my lifetime and most likely beyond.Picturesque Ireland features many Canadian forests and swampy areas and 2 ducks which appear more than once in cut scenes.The producers got a discount on volume fake entrails. Good for them.Unbeknownst to me, horribly inbred freaks have access to brand spanking new hunting knives. Perhaps there's some kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the register.Also unbeknownst to me, if you inbreed for roughly 600 years, as the story leads us to believe happened, you end up being somewhat lumpy, yet amazingly spry and fairly strong. Genetics are a wonderful game of craps.There may or may not be more than one freak in this film. Reference is made to \"them\" and we see shadows, yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever. And when one odd looking dude is finally killed, apparently all danger is passed. I'm running with my initial assumption that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up, thus they just used the one. That's what it looks like on screen, anyway.Richard Grieco should be ashamed.Also of note, aside from those shiny new knives, the inbred freaks have access to some posh leather gear, as once Richard Grieco cuts his bonds, there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied up...who also then escapes, because the chains give you enough slack to just undo them, making one wonder why they even bother tying anyone up.A dead body in a shack will be maggot-ridden after what I would guess is about 2 hours has passed. Said dead body will also have glasses on, when no characters wore them. Curious.Jenna Jameson appears for no reason from stage left, chats for 2 minutes, vanishes stage left. In the middle of a giant forest. That's not unusual, as Gary can also pop out of nowhere, which is also known as whatever exists in TV land off the screen.Ms. Jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes vanish like my hopes that this movie wouldn't suck wind.I offer a special nod to the \"Breeder\" character, the poor girl who has been used by the freaks for months (or maybe years) for breeding purposes.

How sad for you all. I have nothing more to say. May God have mercy on us all.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Justifications for what happened to his movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors, drunks and receptionists doing script rewrites aside, let's just take this movie as it's offered, without extraneous explanations.This movie is God awful. Straight up craptastic. Rather than rehash what may serve as a plot, I'll run a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my head.A class (of 5) take a field trip for a history class to the middle of friggin' nowhere Ireland. These students may be Canadian or American, it's difficult to tell. That it was filmed in a Canadian forest rather than Ireland is rather obvious as well. One student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the \"dumb jock\" character from a number of kick ass 80's movie, except when he channels Randy from Scream. One character may be Chris Klein's stunt double. He has a girlfriend who probably gets killed, but it's never really established if that is true. One character is sullen and removed from her peers...just...cuz.... and then there's a blonde girl. Yay blonde girl.Ireland has a population of 2. They're cousins. Gary, who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast, is called \"sir\" more than once. He's very ominous and wears a knit cap. His cousin is a roughed up porn star with the worst Irish accent to befoul film in my lifetime and most likely beyond.Picturesque Ireland features many Canadian forests and swampy areas and 2 ducks which appear more than once in cut scenes.The producers got a discount on volume fake entrails. Good for them.Unbeknownst to me, horribly inbred freaks have access to brand spanking new hunting knives. Perhaps there's some kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the register.Also unbeknownst to me, if you inbreed for roughly 600 years, as the story leads us to believe happened, you end up being somewhat lumpy, yet amazingly spry and fairly strong. Genetics are a wonderful game of craps.There may or may not be more than one freak in this film. Reference is made to \"them\" and we see shadows, yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever. And when one odd looking dude is finally killed, apparently all danger is passed. I'm running with my initial assumption that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up, thus they just used the one. That's what it looks like on screen, anyway.Richard Grieco should be ashamed.Also of note, aside from those shiny new knives, the inbred freaks have access to some posh leather gear, as once Richard Grieco cuts his bonds, there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied up...who also then escapes, because the chains give you enough slack to just undo them, making one wonder why they even bother tying anyone up.A dead body in a shack will be maggot-ridden after what I would guess is about 2 hours has passed. Said dead body will also have glasses on, when no characters wore them. Curious.Jenna Jameson appears for no reason from stage left, chats for 2 minutes, vanishes stage left. In the middle of a giant forest. That's not unusual, as Gary can also pop out of nowhere, which is also known as whatever exists in TV land off the screen.Ms. Jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes vanish like my hopes that this movie wouldn't suck wind.I offer a special nod to the \"Breeder\" character, the poor girl who has been used by the freaks for months (or maybe years) for breeding purposes. The poor girl who still has eye shadow on and emotes on camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua.The ending of this movie was clearly tacked on by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental disability that has been cultivated and encouraged with excessive gasoline drinking over the years.Apparently this wasn't just random crap I found on the movie network late at night, apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through it's production.

By favourite I don't mean something I like for now, I mean this film is so supernaturally perfect that there is never another animated experience going to touch it. This is obvious because I am never going to be a child again; I saw this film on ITV in the early nineties. I was 12 which is the age group this film is directed at, I'm also male, the gender that this film is intended for (the overwhelming majority of Miyazaki's protagonists are female). Consequently this film indelibly inspired my childhood psychology and I am forever indebted to Carl Macek (sp?) for producing the English dub of this film which is far superior to the Di$ney production which is not even funny - I've never even been able to watch that one - of course subtitled is the only way ultimately however the Macek version is SO good (the voices almost exactly corresponding to the original Japanese actors) that this version is available on the Japanese DVD! It's not available on any distribution in an English-speaking country. Go figure.There are hundreds of competent reviews so I'm going to put some trivia here, not that I'm the definitive archive of information for this film.First up I'd like to agree with the reviewer who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to review Miyazaki's films - they are so in their own league that they make almost the whole catalogue on IMDb combined pale into insignificance.The fascinating story with this film is that Miyazaki based the countryside around Slag's Ravine (Pazu's town area) on the Welsh mining communities. He visited Wales for a few months in the early 80s (might be late 70s) just after one of the great mining strikes. Being an avid supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight. The fight between the townsfolk and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man. The countryside and the clouds especially in this film remind me of where I grew up as his film depicts a fantasised version of the rolling hills of the midwest British Isles.The island is of course from Swift's genius satirical novel of the eighteenth century - the story in Swift's book is, deliberately, ridiculous. In Castle in The Sky, Miyazaki weaves together myths such as Atlantis and the Tower of Babel - I think the architecture in addition is based on Peruvian ruins though I'm not sure, someone told me that.Anyone who gets round to reading this review and who likes this film REALLY will want to check out Miyazaki's epic series Mirai Shounen Conan - Future Boy Conan - based on the short sci fi novel'The Incredible Tide' by Alexander key (novel is available online). Conan is basically a prototype for Laputa's Pazu and Shita. In addition you may not be familiar with his earlier work for Masterpiece Theatre - some of his key frame animation. He also did key frame for Sherlock Hound - this has some of the finest backgrounds I've ever seen too. Also check out Miyazaki and Takahata's first feature film Horus Prince of the Sun (1968) - amazing by today's standards in fact. What else.... Gauche the Cellist and The Flying Ghost Ship - though they're pretty rare.This film is such a gift, I don't know what we'd do without it with all this other crap storytelling around, this is like an oasis.

{"original_text": "\"WEEKEND\" (2011) - A Captivating Exploration of Intimacy and Connection In \"Weekend,\" director Andrew Haigh delivers an intimate and profoundly affecting portrayal of a brief encounter between two men that transcends the boundaries of a traditional romance.

Rating: \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f (5/5) Review: Oh my burger-loving heart, Wendy's has won me over with their mouthwatering creations! From the moment I walked through the doors of their cozy restaurant, I knew I was in for a treat. This place is a true haven for burger enthusiasts seeking a fast food experience like no other. The moment I sank my teeth into their signature Dave's Single burger, my taste buds were sent on a flavor rollercoaster ride. The juicy, perfectly seasoned patty was nestled between a soft, toasted bun, complemented by fresh veggies and a secret sauce that left me craving for more. Every bite was a symphony of flavors dancing in harmony, leaving me in burger heaven. What sets Wendy's apart from the rest is their commitment to using high-quality ingredients. Their beef is always fresh, never frozen, and you can truly taste the difference. The attention to detail is evident in every aspect of their food, from the crispy, golden fries to the rich and creamy Frosty milkshakes that complete the meal. Not only are the burgers divine, but the service at Wendy's is also top-notch. The staff is friendly, efficient, and always ready to go the extra mile to ensure your dining experience is a memorable one. Wendy's has become my go-to spot for a quick and satisfying meal. Whether you're grabbing a quick bite during a lunch break or treating yourself to a delicious dinner, Wendy's is the place to be.

{"original_text": "The overall experience could have been better. The restaurant has a nice ambiance with traditional Chinese decor, creating a pleasant atmosphere. The staff was friendly and welcoming, providing good service throughout the meal. However, I found the food to be average at best. The menu offers a variety of Chinese dishes, but the flavors were not as authentic as I had hoped. The dishes lacked the bold and distinct flavors that are characteristic of Chinese cuisine. While they were decently prepared, they were not exceptional. The portion sizes were decent, and the prices were reasonable for a Chinese restaurant. However, considering the quality of the food, I felt that the prices could have been slightly lower. One positive aspect was the speed of service. The food arrived promptly after ordering, which was appreciated. The restaurant also offers takeout options, which is convenient for those looking to enjoy Chinese cuisine at home. In summary, Shanghai Express is a decent Chinese restaurant with a nice ambiance and friendly staff. However, the lack of authenticity in the flavors and slightly higher prices prevent it from being a standout choice in the area. If you're looking for a quick and convenient Chinese meal, it is worth a visit, but don't expect to be blown away by the taste.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Shanghai Express is a Chinese restaurant that offers a variety of Chinese dishes, but the food is not as authentic as I would have hoped it to be.

{"original_text": "I'm being generous by giving this restaurant 2 stars. The service was so appalling that the fact that the food was actually ok is this place's only saving grace. I think we saw our waiter a total of 3 times the entire evening. We were never greeted after we were seated. We had to ask the Maitre'd if we could get some water and he could not have been more rude and offended that we had asked. Once we finally ordered, we were out of water. After asking for more water three separate times it finally arrived. And from that point until after we received our food, we never saw our waiter again. I asked the bus boy for another glass of wine which never came. Finally the waiter brought it over after we had finished our meal and when I told him I didn't want it any more, he gave me attitude saying he had just seen the ticket. Not my problem! We were never asked if we wanted dessert, we were just presented the check at which point our waiter told us we didn't need to leave a tip since we were clearly displeased with our experience. As if he was going to get a tip in the first place. Getting tipped requires providing a service which he hardly did.

Thankfully, yelp has the new handy reservation feature and I was able to make a reservation from the app just 30 min from when I looked.

I loved everything about it! I also loved that when I sat down, some very delicious cornbread fritters were delivered.

I would go back exclusively for the dip! It was served with fresh pita and was a great appetizer.

{"original_text": "Still being of school age, and having to learn Shakespeare almost constantly for the last four years (which is very off-putting of any writer, no matter how good), I didn't really expect to enjoy this film when my English teacher put it on; I thought it'd be the typical English lesson movie: bad acting, awfully shot, badly edited and the dreaded awful old dialog, so, as you can tell, I was all but ready to go into a coma from the go. However, I watched and, much to my disturbance, found myself not only paying attention, but actually enjoying the movie too. This production of Hamlet is possibly one of the best drama movies I have seen in a long time- and it really brings to life what I expect Shakespeare wanted his plays to be like (well, with the difference that this is cinema) much better than my English teacher harking over the text ever possibly could. The story is good, the dialog seems to flow with an unexpected grace that is far from boring (though a little hard to keep up with if you aren't used to Shakespeare's language) and even the smallest parts are performed with a skill you wouldn't expect; mainly, perhaps, due to the staggering number of cameos this movie has. Brian Blessed and Charlton Heston are as great as you'd expect these two veterans to be, even in such small parts, but it is Robin Williams as Osric and Billy Crystal as the Gravedigger who really stand out, giving such minor parts an unexpected zest, as well as offering some comic relief amidst the tragedy.The main stars, of course, are also wonderful. Kenneth Branagh excels as Hamlet, bringing not only the confusion and pain required to the roll, but also a sort of sardonic air which plays beautifully in the comic scenes, making the movie as a whole much more watchable. The other major players are also good, but it is Kenneth Branagh who stands head and shoulders above the rest in the title role.The set pieces, too, are often quite stunning, giving a refreshing change to the danky old castle corridors we're used to seeing in Shakespeare productions, as well as a real sense of the country around them.Of course, the movie, taken as a movie in its own right, is not without faults, but no major ones (the pacing is the only real problem I can think of offhand, as well as the prose for anyone not used to, as I said, Shakesperean language) and, especially when compared to the sort of Shakespeare productions I'm used to seeing in class, it really is quite brilliant.

However, I watched and, much to my disturbance, found myself not only paying attention, but actually enjoying the movie too. This production of Hamlet is possibly one of the best drama movies I have seen in a long time- and it really brings to life what I expect Shakespeare wanted his plays to be like (well, with the difference that this is cinema) much better than my English teacher harking over the text ever possibly could. The story is good, the dialog seems to flow with an unexpected grace that is far from boring (though a little hard to keep up with if you aren't used to Shakespeare's language) and even the smallest parts are performed with a skill you wouldn't expect; mainly, perhaps, due to the staggering number of cameos this movie has.

{"original_text": "\"Superfly 2\" is a highly anticipated sequel that fails to live up to its predecessor's legacy. While the original \"Superfly\" was a gritty and stylish crime thriller, this follow-up falls flat with its lackluster plot and uninspired characters. The film attempts to recreate the edgy atmosphere of the 1972 classic, but it ultimately feels like a cheap imitation. The story revolves around Youngblood Priest, a drug dealer who wants to leave the criminal world behind. However, the narrative lacks depth and fails to engage the audience. The twists and turns are predictable, leaving little room for suspense or excitement. The characters in \"Superfly 2\" are one-dimensional and forgettable. Youngblood Priest, played by Trevor Jackson, lacks the charisma and complexity that made the original character so captivating. The supporting cast also fails to make a lasting impression, with their performances feeling forced and lacking authenticity. Moreover, the film's attempt to incorporate social commentary falls short. It touches on issues like racism and police brutality, but these themes are poorly developed and feel like an afterthought. The screenplay lacks substance and fails to convey a meaningful message. One redeeming aspect of \"Superfly 2\" is its stylish visuals and slick cinematography. The neon-lit streets and flashy wardrobe pay homage to the original film's aesthetic, but these elements alone cannot salvage the lackluster storyline. Overall, \"Superfly 2\" is a disappointing sequel that fails to capture the essence of its predecessor. It lacks compelling characters, a gripping plot, and fails to deliver on its attempted social commentary. Fans of the original \"Superfly\" may be left feeling underwhelmed by this lackluster follow-up.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Fans of the original \"Superfly\" may be left feeling underwhelmed by the sequel's attempts to capture the essence of its predecessor.fans of the 1972 classic may feel like a cheap imitation, leaving little room for suspense or twists.Overall, \" Superfly 2\" is a disappointing sequel that fails to deliver its attempted social commentary. fans of the initial \"Super Fly\" may feel disappointed by this follow-up's attempt to capture its predecessor's essence.

I however am completely untouched, bored and cannot stop asking myself why the display of incoherent, inconsistent images which vaguely orbit around a central theme are considered an intellectual journey.What was this movie actually about? Growing sexuality in a woman? I've seen great films on this subject, but this is not one of them. How can one attempt to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person not only as a narrative device to dream (in the nude) of beasts. Where there are no characters, there is no character study. The woman persecuted by the beast was not adolescent, the girl having sex with the black butler (is he also characterized as a beast?) has a very grown up attitude to sexuality, so where is the consistency? Is it a movie about religion? If yes we would need a bit more thematic material than a priest without function, character and charisma, but with a strong desire towards two young boys.Is it about bestiality? The metaphoric feel of the movie forbids any realistic examination of bestiality, especially as realistic examination requires realistic characters. So no real bestiality here. Some mythic beast and two priests talking to each other about the sin of bestiality. Enough for a college essay on the topic? I don't think so.Is it about sex? Is it about anything? I don't know. I only know that showing a fired gun doesn't make a film a war movie. Dealing with a topic must mean more than displaying its own associations with the theme.So look across the controversy. Don't be scared by the bestiality, nudity, ejaculations, masturbation and stuff. I am not. Look at it as you look at any other story and you might discover that this is a poorly made, poorly edited, poorly acted, really poorly written (okay, some pictures are quite nice, and the main character is a really good looking girl) cerebral masturbation of a director who thinks beating around the bush in a hypnotic slow manner will make a story intelligent.

{"original_text": "I think this film has been somewhat overrated here. There are some things to admire in it; for one thing it deserves credit for being a science fiction(ish) film which relies on its story instead of special effects and action sequences to carry the day. The supporting cast is good, the set design and cinematography are good, and the ideas are interesting enough (though they are beginning to seem a little tired after the many mediocre Dark City / Memento / Fight Club clones of recent years). But the film is undone by poor characterization, wooden performances from the lead actors, and a laughably bad ending.The main problem I had was that the protagonist was neither likable nor unlikable. I realize that part of the story dictates that he should be a bit of a (wait for it...) cipher, but I was utterly unable to work up any empathy for a character that just seemed like a boring, anonymous schlub of a man. What character transformation there is for this sad sack is artificially forced on him by the plot. Lead actor Jeremy Northam succeeds in conveying that the protagonist is confused and hapless, but fails at inspiring any sympathy for him. Opposite him, Lucy Liu does what she can with a character who has no real personality of her own, unless being the embodiment of a spy-movie clich\u00e9 counts as personality.One of the biggest disappointments of this movie is the ending. I won't give any spoilers here, but I will say that a surprise twist at the end was telegraphed pretty clearly at least 45 minutes before it occurred. Further, after being content to be a quirky, idea-oriented movie for the first hour or so, the last few scenes suddenly and terribly devolve into the worst kind of Hollywood pap, complete with big explosions and special effects. The revealing of the film's McGuffin at the end is poorly done, and at the end the characters seem even less likable than they did before some of the film's main plot threads were resolved.The movie's not all bad, though. It does manage to maintain a certain low level of tension throughout most of it, despite the slow pacing (although I think I have a higher than average tolerance for slow-paced movies). And there are some moments when the unsettled, paranoiac feeling that director Vincenzo Natali was clearly trying to evoke rises to the surface.

MAYBE if you have HBO and have NOTHING else to do at 2am on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, this may be OK.Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human'Kermit the Frog' act in a Hollywood Blockbuster, just didn't work at all."}

{"original_text": "\"Persona\" is a mesmerizing masterpiece of psychological cinema that grips you from the very first frame and refuses to let go until long after the credits have rolled. Director Ingmar Bergman's exploration of identity, isolation, and the blurred lines between reality and illusion is an audacious and thought-provoking tour de force. The film follows the enigmatic relationship between Alma, a young nurse assigned to care for Elisabet, a famous stage actress who has suddenly fallen silent. As Alma becomes increasingly obsessed with breaking Elisabet's silence, the boundaries between the two women begin to blur, unraveling a haunting web of secrets, desires, and suppressed emotions. Bergman's direction is nothing short of genius, utilizing stark black-and-white cinematography to create an atmosphere of eerie beauty and lingering tension. The performances are equally exceptional, with Liv Ullmann delivering a tour de force portrayal of Alma, capturing the character's vulnerability and unraveling psyche with astonishing depth. Bibi Andersson is equally remarkable as Elisabet, her silence speaking volumes as she communicates through hauntingly expressive eyes. \"Persona\" is a film that demands your attention and rewards it tenfold. Its exploration of the human psyche and the complexities of our innermost selves is both unsettling and mesmerizing, leaving you pondering the nature of identity long after the final frame. This is a film that challenges the very essence of storytelling and blurs the lines between fiction and reality, making it an essential viewing experience for any lover of thought-provoking cinema.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Ingmar Bergman's \"Persona\" is a film that demands your attention and rewards it tenfold, leaving you pondering the nature of identity long after the final frame, writes the BBC's Daniel D'Addario in this week's film critic's review of the Swedish drama, which won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival last year. \"Personas\" is an outstanding film that challenges the very essence of storytelling and blurs the lines between fiction and reality, making it an essential viewing experience for any lover of thought-provoking cinema. \"Man on the Moon\" won the Palme d'Or at last year's Cannes Film Festival, but it's another Swedish film that deserves to be on your list of must-sees."}

All in all, most of the film goes down very easily. It is also forgotten again very easily though."}

{"original_text": "This gripping tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a sharper picture and crisper sound. My only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are difficult at times. Luckily even missing a word here and there won't spoil the fun: the primary actors are ideally cast. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, a go-for-broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable; her acting rivals her beauty. (The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them!) Each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well. The mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally improved by viewing \"Reckless\" -- but you'll have plenty of fun.

Unintentionally funny true story adapted from Gertrude \"Trudy\" Davies Lint's memoirs about a wealthy doctor's wife who turns their mansion into a menagerie for pets and wild-life. The movie goes beyond good intentions...it positively drips with earnest sincerity. The movie never sparkles with the kind of \"family film\" magic that it needed, and before too long both the people and the animals seem distinctly programmed (nothing here feels real). About ten minutes in, two chimpanzees are goofing around in Russo's kitchen and start throwing a butcher's knife back and forth (it misses Alan Cumming's head by inches); yet, no eyebrows are raised because it's all in a day's fun. Still, when full-grown gorilla Buddy gets crazy during a thunderstorm, the cops are called--and everyone stares at Buddy through the window while he busts up the living room furniture. The furniture should be the least of anyone's worries in this flabbergasting, do-gooder failure.

While there were some intense action scenes and impressive martial arts sequences, the overall story lacked depth and failed to fully engage me as a viewer.

{"original_text": "\"Secret Sunshine\" reminded me of \"The Rapture\" (1991), with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better film. It portrays super-religious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city, and the main character's experiences interacting with them in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of Milyang ('Secret Sunshine' in Chinese) from Seoul with her young son. She has chosen Milyang because her late husband (killed in an auto accident) was born there, and she feels she needs to make a new start in life in a new place. She does not react well to the overtures of the local Christian zealots, one of whose members tries to convince her to come to their church and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially irreligious and brushes these people off as politely as she can. In fact, she brushes just about everyone in Milyang off to begin with, but some of them are persistent in trying to invade her world, and the consequences are often hilarious. To say more would be to give the film away, but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role (Jeon Do-yeon) is stupendous.

It portrays super-religious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city, and the main character's experiences interacting with them in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of Milyang ('Secret Sunshine' in Chinese) from Seoul with her young son. She has chosen Milyang because her late husband (killed in an auto accident) was born there, and she feels she needs to make a new start in life in a new place. She does not react well to the overtures of the local Christian zealots, one of whose members tries to convince her to come to their church and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially irreligious and brushes these people off as politely as she can. In fact, she brushes just about everyone in Milyang off to begin with, but some of them are persistent in trying to invade her world, and the consequences are often hilarious. To say more would be to give the film away, but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role (Jeon Do-yeon) is stupendous.

Even without the benefit of knowing it not to be real though, I think I'd have worked out that it indeed wasn't.Throughout the film, the girl's reactions to what is being done to her just aren't what they should be. She should be screaming like a banshee in pain. The fact that she isn't means that it's obviously not real. I wouldn't want to watch it if it were real but if she were to be more convincing in her acting, the film would be more disturbing.And then there are the notorious scenes: nothing affected me at all up until the scalpel in the hand.

Strictly a bar, they have a full liquor selection and a variety of draughts and a slew of whiskeys that are sure to please even the pickiest of alcohol drinkers. In addition, the bar houses a cigar case for those who like to light up while drinking when the mood strikes them. The bar has an outside covered patio which is nice for enjoying the lovely Florida weather. I always appreciate a bar where I can sit outside and people watch and get some fresh air. With the bar being at the base of the high rise residential Element, there is surely a good amount of people watching to occur. There is metered street parking or if you visit on the weekend, you're in luck: free on street parking in metered spots. The bar has pool tables and dart boards as well as TV trivia for the guests entertainment. There are well, beer, and martini specials everyday during their happy hour from 12-7pm. I would be sure to ask your bartender about the offerings, as they are not readily posted. If hunger strikes when you are there, there is a list of local restaurants and food options in the area, and those that deliver are marked. Duckweed Urban Market is a few doors down and you can get quick snacks or prepared meals from there. All in all, I enjoyed my pleasant experience at the bar. Knowledgeable staff, the decor, and the crafted drink were a hit in my book. It might be worth noting that Paddywagon won the award for the best Bloody Mary from the 2015 Bloody Mary festival this year. Props to them and this nice addition to the downtown scene. It might be important to note that on this particular occasion it was a rainy, stormy day and we popped in during an odd-off time, like around 3:30pm on a Saturday so that is why there were few bar patrons as pictured.

People have relationships, some go good, some not so good, it's just life. And we're less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don't have to kill the character off to keep the survivor's nobility intact. But that's if Bonanza were done today.But we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped, the secret of Bonanza's success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his stalwart sons. Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name. His whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense Ponderosa spread for his three children. The kids were all different in personality, but all came together in a pinch.The Cartwrights became and still are an American institution.

Other characters had been added on by that time, David Canary, Tim Matheson, and Ben Cartwright adopted young Mitch Vogel. But big, loyal, but a little thick Hoss was easily the most lovable of the Cartwrights. His sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family.So the Cartwrights of the Ponderosa have passed into history. I got a real taste of how America took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City. It doesn't look anything like what you see in Bonanza.

Simon, who adapted the script from his play (which goes uncredited), equates old age with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for 43 years, which begs the question \"how long did vaudeville last, anyway?\"). Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of Neil Simon's screenplays; here, Ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent Matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to tone down the character, to nuance his temperament to give \"The Sunshine Boys\" some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf.

{"original_text": "\"Amarcord\" is a captivating and visually stunning film that captures the essence of a small Italian town in the 1930s. Directed by the legendary Federico Fellini, this semi-autobiographical masterpiece takes viewers on a nostalgic journey through the director's memory lane. The film brilliantly portrays the colorful characters and eccentricities of the townspeople, creating a tapestry of comedic and poignant moments. Fellini's attention to detail is impeccable, as he beautifully captures the sights, sounds, and even the smells of the era. The cinematography is simply breathtaking, with vibrant and dreamlike visuals that transport the audience to a different time and place. The ensemble cast delivers stellar performances, bringing to life a range of unforgettable characters. The film's humor is both subtle and slapstick, with scenes that will leave you laughing out loud. However, amidst the humor, Fellini also explores deeper themes of love, sexuality, and the impact of political and social changes. The soundtrack is a delightful mix of nostalgic tunes that perfectly complements the on-screen action. Each song adds an extra layer of emotion to the film, enhancing the overall viewing experience. \"Amarcord\" is a true cinematic gem that showcases Fellini's genius as a filmmaker.

This has got to be the most unintentionally funny movie I've seen in a loooong time. The plot is fairly straightforward: Racheal's (Monica Calhoun) sister is killed by a band of brigands (Led by Bobby Brown!) and, like many an action movie before this, she straps on her guns ONE LAST TIME and vows to avenge her sisters death. To do this, she reassembles the titular Gang of Roses (supposedly based on a true story of a female gang) and they go out and exact revenge and, along the way, there's some subplot or something or other about some gold that might be buried in the town. One nice thing I will say about this movie is that from what I could tell, the stars did their own riding and they looked GREAT galloping.The funniest (albiet unintentionally funny) scenes? Look for when they introduce Stacy Dash's character or when Calhoun's character rescinds her vow not to strap on her guns (replete with a clenched fisted cry to the heavens) or Lil' Kim's character joking with Lisa Raye's character or Stacy Dash's character being killed or Lil' Kim's character convincing Lisa Raye's character to rejoin the gang or the Asian Chick or Macy Grey's character talking bout \"The debt is paid\", etc. With the exception of Calhoun's Racheal and Bobby Brown's Left-Eye, I can't even remember the names of the other characters cuz I was laughing so hard when they were introduced.If the director had gone for parody and broad comedy this would have been a great movie.

{"original_text": "I saw this film a while ago on a Video CD.I will 1st mention the good points.The movie, at first, at least tries to appear that it is not biased, like not showing one character as black and the other as white. Both main characters are friends and co-exist very well in an country and economy that is not booming while at the same time not failing. Their families get together and have parties and they practice their favorite sport, Sport Rifle shooting, as comrades not as competitors.But, after the 1st 15 minutes the plot runs into a fork in the road. The audience is expected to believe that for some unknown reason these friends must hate each other. That for some unknown reason Bosnia is now on a path to conflict. Sure, the script adds in TV footage which the characters appear to be watching live news programs in English, but the clips are from 1993 not 1992 when the war began.The history, the 1990 elections, the people who caused the war are not mentioned. The movie tries to place the blame with Karadzic, who had been a Presidential candidate and leader of the Bosnian Parliament's 2nd Largest Party(SDP). According to the Constitution of Bosnia, the SDP was to have the Presidency in 1992, but there was a Coup in January. The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Action Party seized total control and held a segregated referendum in March in which it declared itself the law in Bosnia and announced Secession.The history of the IDAP begins with Bosnian Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, a man suspiciously absent from \"STtH\". He was a student of Nazism in WW2.

Both main characters are friends and co-exist very well in an country and economy that is not booming while at the same time not failing. Their families get together and have parties and they practice their favorite sport, Sport Rifle shooting, as comrades not as competitors.But, after the 1st 15 minutes the plot runs into a fork in the road. The audience is expected to believe that for some unknown reason these friends must hate each other. That for some unknown reason Bosnia is now on a path to conflict. Sure, the script adds in TV footage which the characters appear to be watching live news programs in English, but the clips are from 1993 not 1992 when the war began.The history, the 1990 elections, the people who caused the war are not mentioned. The movie tries to place the blame with Karadzic, who had been a Presidential candidate and leader of the Bosnian Parliament's 2nd Largest Party(SDP). According to the Constitution of Bosnia, the SDP was to have the Presidency in 1992, but there was a Coup in January. The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Action Party seized total control and held a segregated referendum in March in which it declared itself the law in Bosnia and announced Secession.The history of the IDAP begins with Bosnian Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, a man suspiciously absent from \"STtH\". He was a student of Nazism in WW2. He even wrote his own \"Mein Kampf\" in which he stated: \"It is not in fact possible for there to be any peace or coexistence between'the Islamic Religion' and non-Islamic social and political institutions\".In 1990 he lost the IDAP elections to \"pro-Yugoslavia Moderate\" Fikret Abdic, a Bosnian Muslim, that worked with Christian Serbs during the Civil War, and who treated his supporters like brothers.

{"original_text": "Well, where to begin? I guess I can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed. Call me ignorant for not knowing of Schneebaum's book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that I have been living under some kind of a rock, but don't blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this \"documentary\" is actually a companion to said book. Yeah, I felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why I sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a \"Modern Cannibal Tale.\" I mean, am I a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes? I certainly didn't expect an hour and forty-five minutes of one old geezer kissing his own ass by whining about every little detail of his dull and worn out life. I certainly didn't expect the insipid directing and I most notably did not foresee myself laughing so hard at Tobias Schneebaum and all of his off-putting glory.Schneebaum is indeed unlikable. The old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of his even though he isn't even that interesting a character to fill a story. Oh really? He was a cannibal? Ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding Schneebaum's dirty past. The only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when Tobias finally breaks his little silent treatment about what happened to him in Peru and say that he had \"a small piece.\" That's it, folks. Ninety minutes of bull later and Tobias Schneebaum is a cannibal by three inches. It's like calling a movie \"The Life Of A True Don Juan\" only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when he once played \"just the tip.\" Unbelievable.The directing is, indeed, superbly ghastly as there is no flow or rhythm to the story that is being told. Alright, I understand that I didn't read Schneebaum's volume before watching his celluloid tale of it, but I can still recognize some bad pacing and even worse editing. One minute Schneebaum is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next he's going on and on about how he can't drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative or some failed and miserable saga in his life. I mean, Jesus, can you at least slam his back story to the first part; follow up with some stuff covering his homosexuality and then end it off with a hearty look into his visit to Peru? Also: I don't particularly care much for Schneebaum's insipid little quips on life and living, but I at least implore the old man to keep consistent with his ramblings. If I hear a guy talking about how he prefers life in the jungle I don't expect him to suddenly bitch and moan about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later. Absurd.Another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which our hero has appeared. While some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story, the director has overused the gimmick and broken his entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reels.The bottom line, here, is that Tobias Schneebaum is a fraud. Pure and simple. I know that I haven't read the book, but I'm still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own. This documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an avid fan of Schneebaum's work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a DVD. Schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy, striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that his story is remarkably un-riveting. If you're looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism, turn away because \"Keep The River To Your Right\" is an embarrassingly hilarious self-serving rant over a man who is long overdue for a straight-jacket and a gag.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Well, where to begin?

{"original_text": "Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made. An example of the directing: When Candy (Jean Peters) starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing, an alarm goes off in the background in the building she's in -- as if it's an alarm going off in her head. It's not cartoon-like -- it's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you've seen the film a few times and it just \"clicks\" that there's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag.Richard Widmark is way on top of his game as a smart-alec -- he's really great -- but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for \"Moe,\" the street peddler/informer, played by Thelma Ritter.

An example of the directing: When Candy (Jean Peters) starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing, an alarm goes off in the background in the building she's in -- as if it's an alarm going off in her head. It's not cartoon-like -- it's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you've seen the film a few times and it just \"clicks\" that there's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag.Richard Widmark is way on top of his game as a smart-alec -- he's really great -- but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for \"Moe,\" the street peddler/informer, played by Thelma Ritter.

{"original_text": "Although only a short distance from the French Quarter, Frenchman Street is like stepping into a different realm. It's only two-blocks long but full of life and non-stop entertainment and on any given day of the week, you can hear the live sounds of reggae to Latin to blues. To kick off a night on Frenchman Street, it's best to do so on a full stomach so stopped into Mojitos Rum Bar and Grill on the edge of Frenchman Street for dinner and a warm up to a night out on the town. Just like a lot of the other places in the area, Mojitos has their own live entertainment and if u stay late enough on Saturdays a Latin music party. All of this takes place on their beautiful patio but you also do have the option of indoor dining but I highly recommend that you do not do that. Even consider sitting at their large outdoor bar before doing that. Going to a place called Mojitos means you have to get a Mojito. Due to their namesake, they have plenty of options from specialty drinks to the typical fruit flavor kind. I started off with The Frenchman which was amazing and thank fully strong. Later on, I decided to get another drink and selected the Ultimate Mojito. I know it said mint syrup and I don't know what I was thinking but it was the ultimate fail. It tasted just like syrup, medicine syrup. If you'bout that sizzrup, this may be the drink for you. We order the Jerk Chicken Skewer as a starter and it was so unbelievable delicious! Do you know how hard it is to go to a place that doesn't specialize in Jamaican food and for them to actually get it right? The flavors were on point and the spice level was beyond expectations. To offset the spicy factor, the blackberry brandy sauce added just the right touch. There are only four choices for main dishes, but they all sounded so good, I still had a hard time deciding. I ended up ordering the Aruba Scallop. It came with grits and I am actually NOT a fan of grits but these were well flavored and a great compliment to the delicate and well cooked and prepared scallops. A dish like this has potential to lack flavor, but it was really good and had a nice kick to it. My boyfriend ordered the Lechon Asado or as the menu states, citrus marinated roasted Kurobota pork belly. The meal was served with rice and beans. He thought it was really good taste wise, but was disappointed in the portion size which I guess was a little small but I was full after eating my meal. I was very satisfied with the food, service, atmosphere and entertainment. It is a great place to hang out, to drink or eat food. It's a great place period.

An element that is different between the two directors is that Villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic, gritty realism opposed to Almodovar's use of surrealism, although both styles are similar.The piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature.

We also got to try the carmelized onion-smothered wings which were out of this world. Also tasted: meatballs, ribs, salad...all very good. We ordered off the menu a half and half pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. So good. If they had liquor on the menu I would have given them five stars (I'm just not a beer or wine person).

{"original_text": "\"In the Heat of the Night\" is a gripping crime drama that captivates from beginning to end. Set in the racially charged town of Sparta, Mississippi, the film explores themes of prejudice, identity, and justice in a thought-provoking manner. The standout element of the film is the brilliant performances by Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger. Poitier's portrayal of Virgil Tibbs, a skilled black detective from Philadelphia who becomes embroiled in a murder investigation, is nothing short of exceptional. He brings a quiet strength and intelligence to the character, navigating the treacherous landscape of the South with grace and determination. Steiger, on the other hand, shines as the stubborn and bigoted police chief, delivering a nuanced performance that showcases the complexities of his character. The film's direction by Norman Jewison is masterful, with its atmospheric cinematography and tense pacing. The tension between Tibbs and the townspeople is palpable, as the investigation unravels the deep-rooted racism and corruption within the community. The screenplay, adapted from John Ball's novel, is sharp and incisive, seamlessly blending moments of suspense, drama, and social commentary. What sets \"In the Heat of the Night\" apart is its ability to resonate with audiences even today. The exploration of racial tensions and the struggle for equality remains relevant, making the film's message enduring and potent. It serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of justice, integrity, and the need to confront our own prejudices. Overall, \"In the Heat of the Night\" is a timeless classic that combines stellar performances, compelling storytelling, and pertinent social commentary.

{"original_text": "\"Rocky IV\" is a high-octane, adrenaline-pumping masterpiece that delivers both heart and muscle. From the moment the film kicks off, it grabs you by the throat and never lets go. Sylvester Stallone's return as the iconic Rocky Balboa is nothing short of awe-inspiring, showcasing his talent as both an actor and a writer. The plot centers around Rocky's intense rivalry with the formidable Soviet boxer Ivan Drago, played brilliantly by Dolph Lundgren. The film masterfully contrasts the two characters, highlighting the underdog spirit of Rocky against the cold, calculating power of Drago. The intense training montages and epic boxing matches are nothing short of breathtaking, leaving you on the edge of your seat. What sets \"Rocky IV\" apart is its ability to tug at your heartstrings. The emotional depth is evident in the subtle moments of vulnerability, particularly as Rocky mourns the loss of a beloved friend. The film also serves as a metaphorical exploration of the political tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War era. This adds an extra layer of depth to the narrative, elevating it beyond a simple sports film. The cinematography and soundtrack are exceptional, perfectly capturing the raw energy and intensity of the boxing matches. The iconic training montage set to the powerful anthem \"Eye of the Tiger\" is a testament to the film's ability to inspire and uplift. \"Rocky IV\" is a must-watch for fans of the franchise and anyone who appreciates a gripping story of perseverance and triumph. It stands as a testament to Stallone's talent and remains a timeless classic in the world of sports cinema.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 0, "text": "\"Rocky IV\" is a high-octane, adrenaline-pumping masterpiece that delivers both heart and muscle.

The relentless pursuit of Sarah Connor by the Terminator and the constant threat of a dystopian future really left me feeling unsettled. The film's portrayal of a world controlled by machines and the ruthlessness of the cyborg assassin is truly chilling. What made the movie even more disturbing was the thought that this future could become a reality. The idea of machines taking over humanity and using time travel to alter the past in order to secure their dominance is a terrifying concept. It's a stark reminder of the potential dangers of advancing technology and artificial intelligence.

As I watched the American flag (50 stars in 1864?) being dragged behind the horse, I realized why burning that piece of red white and blue doesn't upset me as much as our destruction/indifference to the Bill of Rights. I'm a Southerner, and must have some historical memory.Watching the Tobey McGuire character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave, as he looks at the scalps of blacks and Germans (his ethnic background) being wagered at a poker game.....was interesting. Many twists in this movie. The wife, who is forced into her marriage, shows both lust and a strong will, characteristics we're not used to seeing in'respectable Victorian southern belles'.The crazy wacked out renegade southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin, head of the Copeland Horse-thieving Gang, Inc. in Mississippi, was hung about that time. Bands of homeless men were roaming the countryside, armed. Remind you of Iraq? And how similar we are underneath the facade of religion and ethnic background? And why southerners are STILL fighting that civil war today.Too bad we can't use that same knowledge in our handling of the country we've just invaded and are occupying, fomenting civil war everywhere. That's Mesopotamia, now called Iraq, who happen to have the misfortune to sit on oil. The wild-eyed killers in Missouri, raiding Lawrence, Kansas could as easily be the insurgents we're fighting now with no success.Another anomaly was the father's tribute to the Yankees who move into Lawrence and erect a school \"even before they erect a church. And for that reason, they'll win.\" Huh????? I was taught history in Birmingham, Al and we were taught that the North was much more industrial and richer.....that's why they won. Course, they also LITERALLY had God on their side. As you see here, when the freed slave indicates that he's cutting out to free his mother, sold into slavery in Texas. God, what a horrible legacy slavery gave us.Acting pretty good, lots of blood and gore as the warriors ride gleefully into battle (but didn't hear any rebel yells, so reminiscent of football games in Alabama). You also get a real feeling for how stupid the war was, as the bushwackers and jayhawkers gather their forces for another raid. They have lost sight of why they're fighting, and so do we. Just more mindless slaughter.You're also brought up to date with the limbless kids coming home from Iraq, as the bushwacker (ahh, what connotations) first has his arm seared shut, trying to save it, then has it amputated, and then dies. So much suffering for such a stupid cause.The cinematography is fantastic. Now I have to get back to the DVD and get the production notes, one of my favorite parts of any movie. I suspect that this movie was written by a Gore Vidal, as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era, if you knew History. The dialogue is definitely thought-provoking. Not your ordinary blood and guts war movie, by any means. You see the wounded but still active-duty soldiers, still fighting cause they have nothing else to do. You see the southern raiders, living off the land, stealing indiscriminately. Yet, at the beginning, you've seen the battle stop, so the women could be evacuated from danger. As I read the escalating number of women and children dying in Iraq, I'm thinking, \"Where did we lose our sense of honor as a people?\" I have forgotten why I sought this movie out and bought it after 20 years, but some book somewhere lauded it.

{"original_text": "This place was fantastic. The pizza rolls are not similar in shape to those frozen things; they're actually made like cinnamon rolls, with pizza dough instead of pastry and sauce/fillings instead of cinnamon sugar. They're amazing. I got one of the daily specials, which was puppy drum (fish) with a side of pasta. I wasn't a huge fan of the fish, but I think I just don't like puppy drum as much as I expected to. It was prepared fine, though. The pasta is obviously homemade and the marinara is delicious. My boyfriend got a dish that I can't remember the name of, but it was basically pasta, shrimp, and mushrooms in a rich butter sauce. Shrimp Diane maybe? It was very good. I actually ended up eating his leftovers, and I might get that next time. The bread is good, though very full of sesame seeds, so beware if that's not your thing. We finished with the tiramisu. The flavor was great, but the texture was too wet for my taste. Again, it's more a matter of taste than anything they did wrong. We'll definitely try the \"cherrymisu\" next time, which is tiramisu but with cherry juice in place of coffee. The service was fantastic, the place was clean, it was easy to park.

{"original_text": "I'm still a bit in awe of the experience my wife and I had at Livery yesterday evening, and am trying to think through how to succinctly cover everything I want to share - but simply put, it was incredible. Context: It was our Golden Anniversary last night, 6 years on the 6th.... We had just briefly met Exec. Chef Casey Frank at an event this last Thursday, and decided to celebrate at Livery as we'd been meaning to stop by for awhile now. It seems he must have 1.) seen us come in; 2.) recognized who we were from the event; and 3.) remembered we had mentioned it was our anniversary that night - because after we placed our order of a salad and two entrees, the server came back out and informed us we should \"...forget about your order\" and wait for the experience Chef had lined up for us.... What followed was an astounding 8-course small plate journey, with some of the most delicious and memorable flavor profiles we've encountered in Indianapolis. Chef Casey came out on two occasions to chat with us about the food and make sure we were having a good time. We felt like nothing short of royalty at 6:30pm on a Sunday. Food: (I'll highlight just a few dishes so as not to write a novel) Sweet Plantains were culinary genius. Sweetness of the plantain, saltiness of black bean puree, spice from the habanero guajillo sauce, and brininess of the pickled onion in the pineapple salsa were perfectly balanced. The combinations were so complex, but you could still individually identify each component and the role they played in the dish. Pork Tenderloin could be cut with a fork and was full of flavor. Slight char on the outside gave it smoke, which was complemented by an incredible sweet corn puree and spicy serrano hot sauce. Scallop was the most well-prepared I've had in a long time. Perfect golden-brown sear on the outside, and so tender with not one bite of grit.... A feat that, in my book, is quite an accomplishment! Served with a roasted carrot and poblano pico garnish, it was another masterful balance of sweet and heat while letting the seafood shine. Churros were a playful and well-executed nod to Latin street fare. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a wonderful caramel sauce that was obviously made in-house. Service: Our server Tommy was a delight, from the first moment when he brought us 2 complimentary champagnes to toast. Friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive, he engaged my wife and I just enough to provide quality service and make sure everything was in order, while giving us privacy to enjoy each other's company. We very much enjoyed his service! I honestly don't know what we did to deserve such a gift, but sincere and heartfelt thanks - To Chef Casey, Tommy, and Livery - for making our Golden Anniversary so very special.

{"original_text": "This film was made and cast from my home town. I remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the fact Molly Ringwald was in town...Storyline...Essentially 20 years after a film was \"laid to rest\" without being finished, a group of film students set out to complete it - with dire consequences. It would seem someone does not want the film completed.The storyline is flimsy. One has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek, but it had no real oomph. The characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just don't care about, it seems irrelevant. It is weird hearing Kylie's accent as Australian again and nice to see a kid I went to school with in a starring role. But that doesn't redeem the film at all. Goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in Molly Ringwald. Perhaps due to the nature of the film (it sort of pays homage to 80s films / bad horror films)but really an Aussie actor would have done just fine.As far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed constipated. Some of these kids (especially the two main chics - they played \"director\" and \"producer\") looked like they were trying to act. That is never a good look. Also, the shots had a rough feel about them. Over lit perhaps? Just not as smooth as one is used to.The killer. Lord. Could it be less frightening? There are some shock factors though, and a couple of gross scenes. I did like the film, but it was not great. It went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less. Perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better. They had a lot of characters get killed - but no real build up to them getting slayed.

Hopefully, they'll be better prepared for similar events in the future - it was really frustrating to take 15 minutes to get parked after coming back from a long day of class. Anyway, the check in process was smooth and it seems to be a thing at this hotel to walk guests to the right elevators. Pretty slick...the elevators were problematic a time or two (not working correctly), but I kind of chalk that up to new hotel bugs. The whole feel of the hotel is kind of natural modern...kind of a midwestern twist on scandanavian design. Lots of wood and organic items around the hotel. Very comfortable, very lovely. The room was great - I was put in a nice room on the concierge level. Huge space, great furniture, comfortable bed, no issues with the internet and a really over the top shower with multiple spray heads, etc. Judging by the photos below, I think the rooms on the concierge level might be a little bigger than the standard rooms...but, it's good to have Marriott Status! The concierge lounge was fabulous. Awesome selection of food in the evening - you could just about have dinner up here - 4 or 5 various salads each night in addition to the normal heavier goodies.

{"original_text": "\"El Cid\" is a riveting historical epic that flawlessly blends grandiose battles and political intrigue with a heartfelt exploration of honor, loyalty, and sacrifice. Set in 11th-century Spain, the film follows the legendary Christian knight Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar, known as El Cid, as he navigates the complex landscape of warring kingdoms and religious conflict. Charlton Heston delivers a commanding performance as El Cid, capturing the character's unwavering integrity and indomitable spirit. His portrayal is complemented by the brilliant Sophia Loren, who brings depth and vulnerability to her role as Chimene, El Cid's love interest. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable, lending emotional weight to their tumultuous relationship. Director Anthony Mann masterfully orchestrates breathtaking battle sequences that are as visually stunning as they are visceral. From the thunderous clash of swords to the thundering hooves of cavalry, each moment is impeccably choreographed, immersing viewers in the chaos and brutality of medieval warfare. Yet, \"El Cid\" is not merely a spectacle of violence; it is also a contemplative exploration of the human condition. The film delves into the moral struggles and internal conflicts faced by its characters, delving into themes of honor, duty, and the cost of pursuing one's convictions. With its sweeping cinematography, evocative score, and a captivating narrative, \"El Cid\" stands as a timeless classic, showcasing the best of epic filmmaking.

{"original_text": "This is a generally nice film, with good story, great actors and great songs. The cinematography was unfortunately bad. One of the film's weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from Pretty Woman. Why? Does it hurt to attempt some originality, Abbas? Mustan? Anyone?The film is about a newly married couple, Raj and Priya (Salman - Rani). Priya cannot conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy, and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother, who will carry their child. They pick Madhubala, a vulgar prostitute played by Preity Zinta. The film is not really realistic, I mean, isn't it easier to adopt? And even if they pick a girl, does it mean the man has to sleep with her? Have you heard of insemination? Anyway, I guess if the writers had heard of all this, the film wouldn't have been made, so the concept is apparently intentional.Salman acts very well. It's nice to see him playing a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love to his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman. Come on, it's cheesy and unrealistic. Rani is just about OK; she is generally effective and does try to do something with the role but gets completely overshadowed by Preity Zinta.The film belongs to Preity, who steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance. She makes the transformation from a loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally. She lives the film, emotes and makes you love her and admire her at the same time, partly because of her role, partly because of her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of her career-best performances. There is no doubt she is more talented than her industry contemporaries. She just should do more such roles.The film's ending only highlights what I said above. It is tear-jerking, exciting and very well-acted.

{"original_text": "I first came across this film when I read a book (written in the 1970s) about the career of Mitchell Leisin. I have to admit that over the years I have watched many of his films and find his best work really high quality. SWING HIGH, SWING LOW was supposed to be one of his best. While it did not bore me, it did not impress me as much as HOLD BACK THE DAWN, DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY, KITTY, or even GOLDEN EARINGS. I suspect it just dates too much now to be well liked.Working at Paramount Leisin had a problem in those films that he did which were musicals. Most of the scores he worked with were fairly mediocre. It's true that twice standards appeared in his films, but they were really rare cases: \"Cocktales for Two\" appeared in MURDER AT THE VANITIES, and \"Mona Lisa\" came out of CAPTAIN CAREY, U.S.A. But the rest of the score for MURDER AT THE VANITIES was forgettable. \"Mona Lisa\" was the only tune in CAPTAIN CAREY. It shouldn't have been this way - Leisin's studio had Rogers and Hart working for it in the early 1930s. Why couldn't he have been assigned to a project with them? The score for SWING HIGH, SWING LOW, is pleasant but forgettable. Unfortunately, the movie is centered in the entertainment world, as Fred Macmurray demonstrates great talents as a trumpet player (he even works Carole Lombard into his act by looping his arms around her when he blows his trumpet). The song (sung by Lombard) about how her lover's playing thrills her, is important to the plot. It works in the film, but it would have been better if the song was more memorable.There is a picaresque style to the film - it begins on an ocean liner that Lombard works on, as a manicurist. She is constantly being bullied by her boss Franklin Pangborn (the ship's barber). Then the ship is entering into the Panama Canal, and we see MacMurray as a soldier, who's enlistment is ending shortly. Their first scene together has a nice Leisin touch in it: MacMurray is talking to Lombard, she on the deck of the boat and he on the edge of the wall of the lock. Nice way to keep the action going while the dialog hits a dull bit.The film follows the rise and fall of the Skid Johnson (MacMurray) as he meets Lombard, and begins his reputation as a trumpet player, but meets the \"other woman\" in the film, Dorothy Lamore. The best moments in the film deal with the collapse of the relationship with Lombard, and his collapse as a jazz trumpeter (his appearance and need for alcohol is very untypical for a MacMurray character - even his darker figures like Walter Neff or Mr. Sheldrake or the naval officer who pushes the Caine Mutiny did not demonstrate a reliance on alcohol.Lombard is good as the woman loved but wronged by MacMurray. Lamore has little to really do - possibly the film had more scenes with her in it, but one stands out is her attempt to get MacMurray onto the wagon again. In his opening bit Pangborn is fine. Rarely noticed in films, small part actor Carl Judels is effective as a fair weather fan/friend of MacMurray, who drops him as he goes under (though he gives him a hand-out).Charles Butterworth is as trivial in this film as usual, but he does have one moment when he looks sheepishly at his hands on the keyboard of a piano in the rooms he, his girlfriend, MacMurray, and Lombard share - his red faced appearance is due to embarrassment about a lie that MacMurray is insisting is true. It was a nice, subtle moment.

{"original_text": "It is a visually stunning and thought-provoking film that delves deep into the complexities of human nature and societal pressures. Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, \"The Conformist\" is a masterpiece of Italian cinema that explores themes of identity, conformity, and the struggle for individuality. One of the reasons why \"The Conformist\" is great is its exceptional cinematography. The film is a visual feast, with every frame meticulously composed and filled with symbolism.

Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, \"The Conformist\" is a masterpiece of Italian cinema that explores themes of identity, conformity, and the struggle for individuality. One of the reasons why \"The Conformist\" is great is its exceptional cinematography. The film is a visual feast, with every frame meticulously composed and filled with symbolism.

{"original_text": "This film was an interesting take by Hollywood on the novel by of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes, for the time the very idea of Chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself. I found that the white actors playing Chinese was not as bad as I expected, that it wasn't the Asian equivalent of blackface. Back then there were not really any Asian actors in America (not even George Takei was acting) and Rainer did a good job with her part. It wasn't the greatest performance I have ever seen but for old-school pre-method acting it was nice. The locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects.I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression sort of turns this film into an allegory. Especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it.The film had some parallels to the John Ford style, but I think the Eastern influence affected it as well.

Inferno is actually the second installment in Argento's \"Three Mothers Trilogy,\" following his iconic film, Suspiria.

It maintains Argento's signature stylistic approach, blending vibrant colors, atmospheric lighting, and a haunting soundtrack to create a surreal and nightmarish experience. The film's visuals are incredibly striking, with each frame meticulously crafted to enhance the sense of unease.

This is a little gem of a picture, not least because a resource-depleted future is a reality for us 21st Century citizens. The low-budget opening titles of this movie are great: set to music, a low-tech'tape-slide' sequence composed entirely of archive stills from the dawn of photography right up to 1973, depicts an unspoiled American pastoral developing into a polluted and crowded Hell in less than 2 minutes. Succinct and unambiguous, it's truly memorable. Budget limitations are also behind rather unimaginative cinematography and other constraints, at odds with the story's brilliant premise. The police station sequences are like an episode of some 70's TV detective show, and the other interior sets look basic at best. The budget probably all went on trying to'futurise' the Soylent Executive's'Chelsea West' apartment with state-of-the art goodies, meaning the other costumes are perfunctory, some establishing shots are bizarrely underpopulated and the daytime exteriors seemingly all shot through a smoke filter.The memorable scene where Sol and Thorn (Charlton Heston) share a meal of expensive and rare food neatly summarises their society: They enjoy real bourbon, lettuce, celery, tomato, apple, and beef, and we really sense their lip-smacking appreciation of someone else's wealthy privileges.Robinson's pivotal death scene, in which his character is willingly euthenased at a place called'Home', depicts him immersed in images of the world's once-beautiful flora and fauna as he remembered them, beautifully contrasted with the jaundiced Thorn's dawning realization that the future has been bankrupted, among other horrors.This is one smart film, and its core message is as pertinent today as it was in the early 70s.

Why it won the Academy Award was because it was so shocking at that time that Hollywood, brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned, wanted to celebrate that fact. Filmmakers then were like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store. So, Hollywood gave theater viewers (for probably the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealing....and then awarded its work. It also hoped, I'm sure, to shock mainstream audiences. Well, it succeeded on that level. Audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the Academy, proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time, couldn't help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbage.Forty years ago, as a very young man, I found this film fascinating, too.

{"original_text": "As we all know the sub-genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded. Simply being excessively raunchy isn't enough anymore. I've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days.Coming into the 40 Year Old Virgin I knew basically what to expect; I did see the commercials after all; \"is it true that if you don't use it, you lose it?\" What I didn't expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development. There's still the weird \"off-the-wall\" characters that we see so much in Adam Sandler movies and there's still enough inappropriate language to sink Noah's Ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message.The main character Andy is (unfortunately for me) a person I can relate to. In the first shot I see that he even shares my love for Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a poster for the movie on his wall) and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities. Andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology. Andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. Most importantly of all; Andy is a nice person, he doesn't swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them. Combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he's a serial murderer. It's like my life story.The other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way Andy does. I felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since Andy and his girlfriend Trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie.I suppose since I mentioned one flaw I might as well bring the other noticeable one to light. The story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go; it's quite simple. It deals with Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what's going to happen in the end. Sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know what's going to happen in the end, and I assure you it does. These are definitely small stains on the movie but there's so much good here that I can easily ignore it's few faults.When I say \"good\" I mean \"bad\" of course. This is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad. For the most part I think it succeeded. There are so many hilarious scenes such as Andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or the scene where Andy goes with his Trish's daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else. Ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence \"Ooh! Como se llama!\" An interesting little note about that scene; the actor Steve Carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real. Of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part.Actually since we're talking about Steve Carell, I'd like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since I didn't even know who he was prior to seeing this film. I was just so impressed by his writing, acting and timing that I now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles. This man has talent it The 40 Year Old Virgin proves that.To be honest I had doubts about this film but early word was positive and I knew it was something I was eventually going to see. I'm glad that I did too since it's probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching.

{"original_text": "My hubby and I decided, on a whim, to visit, since we saw some decent ratings. We arrived just after 1pm. It was packed with people: families, couples, teenagers. We walked up to the counter and ordered a Greek Quesadilla and a New Orleans Quesadilla with a coke to share. It came to $18. As I walked into the dining area, I like led the simple ambiance. Not many tables available; and, the open tables were not clean. Red flag for me. I cleaned our table of choice and held back my opinion about it. Later our order taker cleaned off the rest of the tables, and did a mediocre job of sweeping the floors. Not bad, but enough to make you ask yourself how well they manage their crew. Okay, on with the food. They called out our order and the Quesadillas came out piping hot. We had to wait a few minutes to eat them. Each 12\" Quesadilla was served on a tray lined with foil. A handful of lettuce graced the presence of the correlating international sauce (eg. Italian, Greek, Mexican), served in a small cup. Tzatkiki, for example, with the Greek. I opened the Greek and it was steaming hot with gooey cheese, black olives, and banana pepper. I added lettuce for more depth. The flavors were mild, but tasty. Nothing that really wowed me or that I could not make at home. I ate half and took the rest home. The New Orleans style was made with blackened chicken, red pepper and bacon nestled in melted cheese (of which he could not recall). He said he liked it. That was all.

{"original_text": "I haven't yet read Kurt Vonnegut's Mother Night (though I've read other books of his, all outstanding pieces of satire and game-changing novel pieces). After seeing Keith Gordon's film adaptation of his book, it will be an immediate must-read in the near future. It's the kind of material that I'm sure if it wasn't made in 1995/96 as a film, it would be picked up right away today in the time period when many period post/present-Holocaust/WW2 movies are quite popular. Except that this is much darker, though even more resonant, about the nature of playing roles and the real underlying horror of living with life after war than say The Reader. It's about the very real danger of pretending in wartime, which is what being a spy in WW2 is really all about.It would be one thing if Mother Night had a script with a lot of emotional depth and complexity about the moral choice and constant role- even after the war ends- for Howard W. Cambpell (Nick Nolte), which is does. But it's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique. Keith Gordon is not someone I usually think of as a director of really strong material (more-so I think back to him as an actor, oddly enough featured briefly with Vonnegut himself in Back to School), but this is a revelation. He takes the story of Campbell as a story of a fractured life: a German propaganda master (the \"only American left in Berlin\"), who is actually a spy for the Americans but can never have his identity revealed, and was before a playwright who really belonged to \"a nation of two\", himself and his wife (Sheryl Lee). It follows him from his prison cell, awaiting trial in Israel in 1961, as he writes his memoir and tells of his disillusionment about being a'pretend' Nazi, and then in 1960 in semi-hiding in a New York apartment, which is where the bulk of the film takes place.Mother Night can be quite heavy, like on a level one might associate with the Pianist, but on another more emotional-cerebral level than the stark poetry of that film. Gordon, by way of Vonnegut, is trying to give us a strong look at a man who has nothing, except the memory (and then later a weird transposition) of his long lost love in a \"sister\" who has come back to him in NYC, so he's left to his own devices when he befriends a painter (Alan Arkin, very very good here), and then is found out as a Nazi-in-hiding by a white supremacist newsletter, leading wackos to his apartment. On the surface this should be just a straightforward spy story, but not a thing is straightforward. The'something' of this man's life is staggering, but it's ultimately of his own choosing. Campbell is one of those characters that could be analyzed for hours on end, but the same conclusions might be reached (and, in a way, mirrors the line Goebbels said): the bigger the lie, the more people believe it. That is except for the select few who started the lie and know its secret and power.But oh, it would be one thing if it were just a wonderful and tragic-comic tale, or another if it were featuring some really fantastic performances (which is does: Nolte is at his very best here, and Sheryl Lee, who we might remember from Twin Peaks as Laura Palmer, stuns in multiple roles, especially in the scene when she reveals she's not'really' Helga). It's also a gorgeously shot film, with brilliant lighting and shots that reflect the state of mind of the character, or just the starkness or sickening colors of the time (watch the scene where an old Campbell watches a film of his younger self spouting out a rant, the juxtaposition of faces is great). And the music selections rise the level of tragedy. It could be argued some of the music is too much, but at other times it elevates the material past its own usual dramatic dimensions and makes it operatic, solemn about human nature.It's not always an easy film to take emotionally, and some of the twists do have that tinge of \"whoa\" as in any spy story. But it's the subversion from Vonnegut that sticks through, the way of taking appearance and performance, of life imitating art imitating life imitating death, and making it into something worth remembering. I have no idea just yet if the book is better than the film (or the other way around), but at the moment it's hard for me not to recommend this to anyone looking for a masterpiece of post WW2/holocaust storytelling.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I haven't yet read Kurt Vonnegut's Mother Night (though I've read other books of his, all outstanding pieces of satire and game-changing novel pieces).

It was fresh and flavorful. The dressing was a bit on the heavy side for a vinaigrette. For entrees, I had the Black and Blue burger with fries. The burger was just incredible. It was perfectly cooked. The blue cheese was not overpowering. The bun was soft and fresh. The side of regular fries were crisp and lightly salted. Even better, they went perfectly with the homemade ketchup. I'm not a fan of ketchup, but theirs is very nice since they seem to avoid adding too much sweetness. My son had a basic burger with sweet potato fries. I tried the sweet potato fries and think they might be some of the best I've ever eaten. The burger looked as good as mine and my son concurred.

{"original_text": "\"My Left Foot\" is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of Christy Brown, an artist who was crippled with cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot, the only limb in his body he had control over. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar as Best Actor for this film, which I'm not absolutely certain was deserved, but is still noteworthy. Day-Lewis give Brown a realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch. Brenda Fricker, as Brown's devoted mother, also won an Oscar for a believable and touching role. My problem with this film is that it is a bit too real at times. When Brown is in desperation and must help someone and do it all with his left foot, the film can be difficult to watch. This gives it an often depressing feel that may turn off some viewers for a time. However, if you look beyond that, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have handicaps and other difficulties to overcome. Those of us who are not crippled and still consider ourselves to have problems are inspired by this film, because if somewhat with a much worse condition than us can overcome their difficulties, we can certainly do the same thing.

{"original_text": "I was impressed by the beautiful photography in this film, which was shot on location in Alaska. Although technically a melodrama, we see lots of activities Eskimos are involved in, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely in the story. The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but even these were fascinating. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a documentary at times. There was no cast listing, which reinforced the documentary flavor. The film-makers tried to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on. But they were excellent in their roles and they went on to have Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is definitely worth a look.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I was impressed by the beautiful photography in this film, which was shot on location in Alaska.

{"original_text": "I am reviewing the hotel and the conference/meeting rooms. First, the staff everywhere throughout this whole building is NICE NICE NICE. Everyone was beyond gracious and accommodating. I have zero complaints about the staff. They would obviously go out of their way to help anyone. Every bartender, every catering staffer, every hotel desk person, all of them, were SO customer-service oriented. Excellent all around in this area. The hotel rooms (standard room, paid $99 a night for a Fri. and Sat. in early August) look nice now because they are relatively new but I am not sure they will hold up over time. Very spacious for such a low price and the views are great. However, the room walls are paper-thin. I mean PAPER!! I heard everything (even the normal volume conversations -- in detail--- happening in the room next door). My neighbors also had a baby that cried for over 3 hours one day which made napping impossible. I have never heard so much through a hotel room wall before. This is a definite problem and I suspect they hear a lot about it from patrons. Another review mentioned that the room lighting is bad. This is true. It was nearly impossible to put on makeup even though they had a nice magnification mirror in the bathroom. I tried every spot and couldnt find a place with lighting. I ended up sitting by the window because it was still daylight and holding up my tiny compact on the couch. This is a small but highly frustrating thing for a woman. The shower and bathrooms are very nice in the rooms. High quality and the water was warm. I really liked the bathroom. So clean, too! The TVs are pretty neat because you can check-out on them. The free wi-fi was spotty and made me login again on their page over and over. The AV in the meeting rooms was cruddy. The mics went in and out and had a lot of interference. However the system is built-in rather than set up like most AV places, so I guess you get what you pay for. The art in all the conference rooms was gorgeous but it was so cold in all of them that I left my meeting to go defrost. I am not an \"always cold\" person -- lots of other people were frosty too. Conference room catering was good for the most part. Some things were high quality and delicious, others felt and tasted very mediocre chain-like. Hit and miss. The pool was always crowded with families. Not a relaxing environment at all. Spa service menu was very reasonably priced but not a lot of options. No deep tissue massage?! I would go back.

What is terribly UNfair is the treatment both the \"stars\" and \"non-stars\" received at the hands of Cates and Horvitz, in the name of \"reducing boredom.\"It is bad enough that for the last several years anyone who isn't Al Pacino has been \"played off\" at 45 seconds without any regard for what he was saying, how he was saying it, and what the emotion was behind the statement. It demonstrates nothing more than a total lack of respect, however, to herd nominees on the stage like cattle without paying them the honor of showing their faces while their names are read, to make them slink away quietly when they lose, to deny them the thrill of a walk to the podium, and to force them to read their statements with their backs to the audience. All of those things were done to the \"non-stars\" -never mind that the movies wouldn't exist at all without those artists and that most of them only ever get one chance to face their peers and their audience.

Off we go. The location is downtown but not smack dab in the casino zone, nice decor, trendy. The menu offers some nice salads and soups. We both had the bean soup (I highly recommend) and salads; Asian Noodle and South West. Both salads were well presented, ample in portion, fresh and flavorful. We took the recommendation of our server and had the house made ginger ale. All in all a very pleasant, delicious lunch. Prepared by nice people, in a trendy setting."}
{"original_text": "Title: Zombie 3 (1988) Directors: Mostly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin Review: To review this flick and get some good background of it, I gotta start by the beginning. And the beginning of this is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn came out in 79, Lucio Fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it Zombie 2. That film is the one we know as plain ole Zombie. You know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark! OK so, after that flick (named Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and made a huge chunk of cash, the Italians decided, heck. Lets make some more zombie flicks! These things are raking in the dough! So Zombie 3 was born. Confused yet? The story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we've seen in a lot of American zombie flicks that we have seen before this one, the best comparison that comes to mind is Return of the Living Dead. Lets see...there's the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. Canister gets released into the general population and shebang! We get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh. A bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel. They gotta fight the zombies to survive.There was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie. First and foremost, Lucio Fulci the beloved godfather of gore from Italy was sick. So he couldn't really finish this film the way that he wanted to. The film was then handed down to two lesser directors Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good. You see Fulci himself didn't really have his heart and soul on this flick. He was disenchanted with it. He gave the flick over to the producers and basically said: \"Do whatever the hell you want with it!\" And god love them, they did.And that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great Fulci credited as its \"director\". The main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore! There's no substance to it whatsoever! After the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it, the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies. Now in some cases this can prove to be fun, if #1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and #2 there's a lot of gore and guts involved.Here we get neither! Well there's some inspired moments in there, like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people. That was cool. There's also a scene involving a flying zombie head (wich by the way defies all logic and explanation) and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs. But aside from that...the rest of the flick just falls flat on its ass.Endless upon endless scenes that don't do jack to move the already non existent plot along. That was my main gripe with this flick. The sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non-existent. I hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished! I like my b-movies, but this one just really went even below that! Its closer to a z-level flick, if you ask me.The zombie make up? Pure crap. The zombies are all Asian actors (the movie was filmed in the Philippines) so you get a bunch of Asian looking zombies. But thats not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway. Its the look of the zombies that really sucks! They all died with the same clothes on for some reason. And what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up (more like smudges) on their faces. One or two zombies had slightly more complex make up, but it still wasn't good enough to impress. Its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces. So not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap. These are supposed to be dead folks! Anyhows, for those expecting the usual coolness in a Fulci flick don't come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody else's flick. And those two involved (Mattei and Fragasso) didn't really put there heart and souls into it. In fact, when you see the extras on the DVD you will see that when Fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick, he doesn't even take it to seriously. You can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they \"just had a job to do and they did it\". And that my friends, is the last nail on this flick. There's no love, and no heart put into making this film. Therefore you get a half assed, crappy zombie flick.Only for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Title: Zombie 3 (1988) Directors: Mostly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin Review: To review this flick and get some good background of it, I gotta start by the beginning.

{"original_text": "The vibe of this place is hip, urban and chill. Definitely a cool place to meet up with friends. It's very pricey but the foods are tasty, different and beautifully presented. My all time favorite dish so far has been the griddled mushrooms! These are so freaking delicious! If you love mushrooms, definitely try this! My friends and I ordered four servings ($8 per small plate) in one sitting. We'd share one small plate, then decide...just one more. There's a poached egg served on top. I recommend poking the egg and letting the yolk coat the mushrooms. Trust me. The mushrooms are cooked to perfection. There's just a bit of a crunch when you bite. Not too soft that can eat them without chewing. Honestly, these mushrooms taste like heaven in your mouth! I also liked the popcorn chicken ($9 for bowl of about 10-12). At first glance, these look like donut holes. But in a way, they also remind me of the chicken balls, you might find in a Chinese food buffet. The outside is crunchy and dusted with popcorn. The round ball of chicken inside is soft. At times, I found the section between the outer crunchy part and just around the chicken, a bit doughy. It would also be nice if there was some sort of sauce to dip these into, for extra flavor. My friends and I ordered a total of three bowls. I definitely recommend sharing. After eating three chicken balls, I personally had my fill. Another beautifully presented and tasty dish, is the crunch salad for $13. This dish looks like a tower of fancy shredded coleslaw. It's made with raw, pickled and fried veggies. When brought to your table, the servers pour the house made dressing, around and on top of this tower. All the while, you're thinking, WOW. Fancy! It's so pretty, you kind of feel bad tearing it down to eat it. Good thing it tastes as good as it looks! It tastes fresh and has just the right amount of dressing. We had two orders of this salad. Last but not least, we had the potato and squash gnocchi for $25. Ironically, the most expensive dish we ordered, was the biggest disappointment. I generally love eating duck. However, one taste of the gnocchi made me turned off by this dish. Hard to explain exactly why. My friend described it as \"too strong of a taste.\" You know how lamb has a distinct taste? Well this dish had a strong taste, but unfortunately, in my opinion, not a good tasting one. The weird thing was, my other friend, who is generally more picky with food, actually ate all the duck meat. He also said he also liked the taste of the broth. In the end, the only thing left in the bowl was the gnocchi. It just had too much of that \"too strong taste\" infused into it.

{"original_text": "I'm not a follower of a certain movie genre. I classify movies only as industrial or non-industrial. Valentine is the second industrial movie of the director Jamie Blanks, after his Urban Legends. Unlike Urban Legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak. Yet again unlike Urban Legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic, and that is what makes Valentine the best. As the first basic and iconic element, the growing hatred of the serial killer is so down-to-earth. Since his secondary school years, he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends, who have made fun of him. When you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie, you will come to see this point of view of Humanism: \"Noone is entirely good or evil. In fact, somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted.\" Just because the story line and the direction is very weak, we are not as satisfied as we deserved. The second iconic element is, of course, the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s' super starlets: My favourite is Jessica Cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed. An arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in, while she was playing hide-and-seek with her blind date, never able to met with. Katherine Heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables. Denise Richards is killed third, while she just found a Valentines' Day gift for her at a whirlpool bath. Jessica Capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way, then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer. Marley Shelton is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know,'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed. Finally, Benita Ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer, David Boreanaz.The third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene, the Valentines' Day celebration at Dorothy's house scenes and ultimately the killing themes.

{"original_text": "While the film had its moments, overall it failed to fully captivate and engage me. The storyline, which follows a group of young boys on a cattle drive led by John Wayne's character, seemed promising at first. However, as the movie progressed, I couldn't help but feel that it lacked depth and originality. One of the main issues I had with \"The Cowboys\" was the characterization. While John Wayne's portrayal of Wil Andersen, the tough and experienced cattleman, was solid, the development of the young boys seemed shallow. Their personalities felt one-dimensional, and I struggled to form a genuine connection with any of them. Additionally, the dialogue between the characters often felt forced and clich\u00e9, which further hindered my ability to fully invest in their journey. Another aspect that left me underwhelmed was the pacing of the film. There were moments of excitement and tension, particularly during the action scenes, but they were few and far between.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "John Wayne's latest film, \"The Cowboys\", was one of the few movies that I was able to enjoy without feeling like I was missing out on some of the finer points of the story and character development, as well as the action scenes and the dialogue, which were often forced and clich\u00e9d.

The plot starts off innocently enough with a chance encounter between a straight-laced businessman named Charles and a free-spirited woman named Lulu.

One of the most enjoyable aspects of \"Something Wild\" is the chemistry between the two lead actors, Jeff Daniels and Melanie Griffith.

{"original_text": "\"Eyes Without a Face\" is a hauntingly beautiful masterpiece that defies the boundaries of traditional horror cinema. This French gem, directed by Georges Franju, is a chilling exploration of obsession, identity, and the dark depths of the human soul. From the very first frame, the film immerses you in a world of eerie ambiance and unsettling tension. Franju's impeccable direction creates an atmosphere of claustrophobia and unease, perfectly complemented by the hauntingly atmospheric score. The cinematography, with its stark black and white visuals, adds an additional layer of eeriness to the already unsettling narrative. But what truly sets \"Eyes Without a Face\" apart is its deeply introspective exploration of the human psyche. The film delves into the complex themes of guilt, redemption, and the lengths one is willing to go to achieve a desired outcome. The characters are multi-dimensional and flawlessly portrayed, with Edith Scob's haunting performance as Christiane stealing the show. The slow-burning narrative allows for a gradual build-up of suspense, culminating in a climax that will leave you breathless. The film's infamous face transplant surgery scene is a masterclass in body horror, simultaneously repulsive and mesmerizing. \"Eyes Without a Face\" is a true work of art that transcends the horror genre. Its thought-provoking themes, coupled with its stunning visuals and exceptional performances, make it an unforgettable cinematic experience.

{"original_text": "\"Halloween II\" \u2013 A Gory Sequel That Hits the Nail on the Head Prepare to be terrified, horror fans! \"Halloween II\" brings back the infamous masked madman, Michael Myers, in a sequel that is every bit as chilling and gruesome as its predecessor. Director Rob Zombie takes the reins once again, delivering a blood-soaked rollercoaster ride that will leave you breathless. Picking up right where the first film left off, \"Halloween II\" plunges us deeper into the twisted mind of Myers. Zombie's dark and gritty visual style adds an extra layer of intensity to the already bone-chilling narrative. The sheer brutality of the kills will have you squirming in your seat, as the body count rises and the tension builds to an explosive climax. One of the standout elements of this sequel is the outstanding performance by the talented cast. Sheri Moon Zombie reprises her role as Laurie Strode, showcasing a raw vulnerability that makes us truly empathize with her character's trauma. Malcolm McDowell is once again exceptional as Dr. Samuel Loomis, bringing a perfect balance of arrogance and desperation to the role. Zombie's screenplay delves deeper into the psychological aspects of the characters, providing a refreshing and thought-provoking take on the slasher genre. The exploration of Laurie's PTSD and her twisted connection to Michael adds a layer of depth that sets this film apart from its predecessors. While some may argue that the film is excessively violent, \"Halloween II\" embraces its brutality, delivering an unapologetically gruesome experience that horror aficionados will relish. If you're a fan of edge-of-your-seat terror and don't shy away from bloodshed, this sequel is an absolute must-watch.

Lois and Clark show up to get the scoop but are disappointed that the deepest well ever drilled will no longer be in operation. A day later, strange events at the well make for a story more appropriate for Superman than Clark Kent. It seems that the radioactive Mole Men have invaded from their six-mile deep home near the earth's core.Supermen and the Mole Men is a simplistic but well-made piece of social realism. Released in 1951, starring a lead actor who served in World War II, the moral of the story seems to be that Americans are just as capable of becoming fascists as anybody else. To drive this point home in a typically straightforward Superman manner, Reeves even accuses the lynch mob hunting the Mole Men of being'Nazis' at one point.Even in the 1950s, the science underlying this film was nonexistent. Six miles of drilling through continental crust would not have even penetrated the upper mantle, let alone the \"hollow center of the earth\" - which, in any case does not exist. Forgivable - keep in mind that this film is based on a golden age comic book.The film is a little unevenly paced. Although the Molemen are interesting, a bit creepy, and nicely portrayed, there are several Corman-esquire scenes which spend too much time redundantly showing us their odd behavior. The script is intelligent and economical. By today's standards, the costuming is poor to fair, but for its time, this film's special effects and costuming were quite good.

{"original_text": "I found this movie to be charming. I thought the characters were developed since as I watched, I found myself caring about these people. This is a period piece that I believe took place during the depression. A single mother, who is known as the town recluse (she has reason to be), puts an ad in the paper for \"a Husband\". Christopher Reeve plays a ex-con who happens into town looking for work. He sees the ad and he goes out to see her. She hires him. I really had some chuckles as their relationship progresses because I found it easy to put myself in their shoes. Everything went on so matter of fact. He needs the work so he doesn't want to upset her. And she needing his help, but doesn't want him to get the upper hand. They dance around the fact that they begin to really need each other. Things start warming up until......the big blowup. I won't spoil it by telling you what happens. But the point of resolution is perfectly wonderful. I found the story to be very believable for the time it's taking place. I think this is one of the better \"relationship\" stories out there. Maybe the younger generation won't \"get it\" but if you are over 40 I think you'll like it.

Now, let's talk about the food. I had high hopes for authentic Mexican cuisine, but unfortunately, Texas Margaritas fell short. The dishes lacked flavor and were bland overall.

I go here not when I'm in the mood for something healthy (though the Paleo Bowl would fulfill that if you are looking for something healthy) I go here when I went delicious bar food. If you like regular nachos, the kind with real melted cheese (not fake cheese sauce), these are some of the best you can get. They're nothing crazy, no unique twist, just damn good nachos. If you want fancier nachos, try elsewhere. But here is going to be one of your best options for straight up regular delicious nachos. The half portion is more than sufficient for one person. I cannot even imagine trying to tackle the full portion. I'm a vegetarian so I never get it with beef, but you can totally add a meat option should you wish. Also delicious is their mac and cheese. It's so cheesy, never dried out, and always has some nice cheese melted right on top. You can get it as a side with many of their burgers, or you can order the entr\u00e9e sized. And in my opinion, you can never go wrong by adding green chiles to the mac and cheese. Because green chilis are a gift. I love their caprese appetizer as well. Standard mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic. But it's always tasty. Same with the mozzarella sticks. Their white bean hummus plate is also delicious. The other thing I love about trident is they do what, in my opinion, all restaurants with burgers should do, they say at the top you can take any burger and substitute a veggie patty. It's baffling to me how many places don't even offer a veggie burger at all (they're frozen! not that hard to keep them stocked!) or if they do, they're hesitant or unwilling to accommodate a request to add it to a different burger than the one veggie burger listed on the menu. Why in the world, if you already have veggie patties on hand, do I have to order the ONE veggie burger you have listed? Why can't I just substitute the veggie patty onto any other option? It drives me bonkers. But for Trident, this is never the case! The mushroom swiss looks good to you? They'll make it with a veggie patty. The green chile burger looks great? They'll make it a veggie. Etc., etc., etc. It's a standard Boca Burger, which are ok. Normally I avoid Boca Burgers, but Trident makes me excited to eat a veggie burger! I recommend the Green Chile with a Boca Burger, and add a fried egg. Side salad and no bun if you want low carb. Or, if you're indulging, side of mac & cheese. For non-vegetarians, my friends are always happy to eat here too. Popular choices among my friends include the grilled shrimp skewers, the non-veggie burgers, the crispy shrimp po-boy, and the paleo bowl. They also have a fully stocked bar.

After 10 going on 11 years of being a patient I will only trust Dr. Baird & Val to care for my teeth for many years to come. (Kid friendly too!) Do you look forward to going to the dentist? I do. They are that great here!"}

I have never rented a car from this location with a full tank of gas. They tell you it has a \"little less than full\". How the heck do you return a car \"a little less than full\"?

For those who care, the plot involves the military, terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni provided the inept direction while Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the hoot of a script.

I've been to dinner, lunch, and happy hour here all multiple times so I know my way around this place. Before I discuss the many great things about this establishment I'll mention two issues that are less than good. First this place has an active bar with multiple TVs. This is great for Happy Hour but not so great if you are seated near it with the intention of having a peaceful meal. So Rule #1 is to ask to be seated away from the bar. I've never found this to be a problem as the staff is very accommodating. Second, in my opinion, the adult libations are generally a dollar or two too high for a mid-level Italian place. It's very easy to order drinks here that go over $10. So consider yourself forewarned. So let's talk about all the positive attributes- The location is fabulous. It's within walking distance of Olde City, the Walnut Street Theater, the Historic District, etc., etc. The have a few outside tables and Chestnut Street is great for people watching. These folks have one of the best free parking arrangements in all of Philadelphia. That's right, I said free and the parking lot is in the same building. If you are driving in it doesn't get any better than this. Note that free parking is available after 3 PM. They use OpenTable so making your reservation is super convenient. By the way, these folks do a great job during Restaurant Weeks. Make yourself a note to book early for those coveted RW seatings. Regarding the food; expect classic Italian in large portions. It doesn't matter if you are a carnivore, like your protein from the sea, or are of the vegetarian persuasion. Everybody will be happy here. Expect appetizers to be about $10 and entr\u00e9es to range from the high teens to mid-twenties. The Broccoli Rabe appetizer ($10) is to die for. It comes with sweet Italian sausage and grilled polenta. The lovely wife has tried the Chicken Alla Roma ($21) and pronounced it excellent. It comes with mushrooms and asparagus in a lemon-caper sauce. If you are in this part of town, give them a try for lunch.

{"original_text": "Released as Zentropa in North America to avoid confusion with Agniezska Holland's own Holocaust film Europa Europa, this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise, inspire or downright shock is a bizarre, nostalgic, elaborate film about a naive American in Germany shortly following the end of WWII. The American, named Leo, doesn't fully get what he's doing there. He has come to take part in fixing up the country since, in his mind, it's about time Germany was shown some charity. No matter how that sounds, he is not a Nazi sympathizer or so much as especially pro-German, merely mixed up. His uncle, who works on the railroad, gets Leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car, and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 Germany's horrors and enigmas.This progression starts when Leo, played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor Jean-Marc Barr, meets a sultry heiress on the train played by Barbara Sukowa, an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor. She seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family, which owns the company which manufactures the trains. These were the precise trains that took Jews to their deaths during the war, but now they run a drab day-to-day timetable, and the woman's Uncle Kessler postures as another one of those good Germans who were just doing their jobs. There is also Udo Kier, the tremendous actor who blew me away in Von Trier's shocking second film Epidemic, though here he is mere scenery.Another guest at the house is Eddie Constantine, an actor with a quiet strength, playing a somber American intelligence man. He can confirm that Uncle Kessler was a war criminal, though it is all completely baffling to Leo. Americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades, but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than Leo, who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death train.The story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film's Danish director, Lars Von Trier, whose anchor is in the film's breathtaking editing and cinematography. He shoots in black and white and color, he uses double-exposures, optical effects and trick photography, having actors interact with rear-projected footage, he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects, caught between glass for our more precise survey.This Grand Jury Prize-winning surrealist work is allegorical, but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer. I interpret it as a film about the last legs of Nazism, symbolized by the train, and the ethical accountability of Americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads. During the time frame of the movie, and the Nazi state, and such significance to the train, are dead, but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexes.The characters, music, dialogue, and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions. The most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones. Two trains halting back and forth, Barr on one and Sukowa on another. An underwater shot of proliferating blood. An uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown. And most metaphysically affecting of all, an anesthetic shot of train tracks, as Max von Sydow's voice allures us to hark back to Europe with him, and abandon our personal restraint.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Released as Zentropa in North America to avoid confusion with Agniezska Holland's own Holocaust film Europa Europa, this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise, inspire or downright shock is a bizarre, nostalgic, elaborate film about a naive American in Germany shortly following the end of WWII.

The plot is actually quite clever and creatively woven. It's almost like a Shakespearean comedy with all of its delightful misunderstandings. And of course there's also.... VERA-ELLEN'S LEGS.The only unfortunate aspect of this film is that the version I purchased (the \"100 Family Classics\" collection by Mill Creek Entertainment) doesn't have the best video quality, and I've heard the same about the Alpha release. The brightness and contrast are a bit too high, so a lot of the scenes seem bleached out especially when Vera is dancing in a white dress. But I suppose you can fiddle with the controls of your TV set to compensate. I can only imagine how it looked on the big screen back in'51. The stage sets, costumes & colours are otherwise dazzling & delightfully creepy--sort of in a \"Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" vein.As far as the romance goes, this is just perfect. Not sappy, not contrived, not melodramatic. Just 100% ahhhhhh. Too bad, you poor schmucks, your miserable lives will never be as charming as this. Har har har. Wait, what am I laughing at?

My father who never watches sitcoms at all, he just watches movies, sports, and law & order, he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my mother, and myself, and watched the show I think because John Ritter was in it. I honestly think this show would still be running if John Ritter God rest his soul I wish he hadn't passed away."}

{"original_text": "\"Masculin f\u00e9minin\" is a thought-provoking and daring film that explores the complexities of gender and youth culture in 1960s Paris. Directed by Jean-Luc Godard, this French New Wave masterpiece delves into the lives of a group of young individuals, capturing their aspirations, desires, and struggles. Godard's unconventional storytelling technique and nonlinear narrative create a sense of dissonance, reflecting the turbulent and fragmented nature of the era. The film is divided into various vignettes, each examining different aspects of youth culture, politics, and relationships. Through these vignettes, Godard presents a scathing critique of societal norms and gender dynamics, challenging the traditional notions of masculinity and femininity. The performances in \"Masculin f\u00e9minin\" are natural and captivating, particularly the lead actors Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud and Chantal Goya. L\u00e9aud embodies the restless and idealistic Paul with remarkable authenticity, while Goya brings a captivating charm and vulnerability to her character, Madeleine. Their chemistry on screen is palpable, adding depth and emotional resonance to the film. Godard's distinct visual style is evident throughout the film, with his use of jump cuts, hand-held camera work, and innovative framing techniques. The black and white cinematography adds a raw and gritty texture to the film, enhancing its realism and immediacy. \"Masculin f\u00e9minin\" is more than just a film; it is a social and cultural commentary that remains relevant even today. Its exploration of gender roles, political disillusionment, and the complexities of youth culture makes it a timeless and influential piece of cinema.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 film \"Masculin f\u00e9minin\" is a thought-provoking and daring film that explores the complexities of gender and youth culture in 1960s Paris, and will be screened at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Cinematheque on Friday, 8 March at 7 pm and on Saturday, 9 March at 2 pm and 7 pm The film will be released in the US on DVD and Blu-ray later this year, and can be viewed online at www.cinematheque.umn.edu/film/masculin-f\u00e9minins-by-jean-Luc-Godard-tickets-available-on-demand-beginning-March- 9."}

For a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all. The list of problems with the film could drag on forever. Chief amongst them is the film is simply too long. It dragged on for a few minutes short of 3 hours. Nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly. Secondly, as many had pointed out from the \"trailers\", the special effects are anything but special. The tripods looked OK in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was grade-Z 1970's or 1980's quality. Probably the worst effects of all were the horses, which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved. The heat ray effects were laughable, as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles. Also pitiful was the Thunderchild sequence, in which the Thunderchild, described in the book as an ironclad ram, looked nothing of the sort. Instead it resembled a World War 1 era destroyer, complete with deck guns (which fired but had no visible crew), and torpedo tubes. The colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects. Most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out Mars to her in the sky. Well, the sky is black, but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight. There is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape, bathed in full sunlight, and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars. To detract even further, the color of the scenes made no sense. In some they are bathed in orange light. In others green light. In still others it's blue light. In some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue. The frame-rate and camera is very shaky, giving everything a stuttering look.Finally, the acting is overall sub-par. One man portrays two characters who's sole difference was one lacked a mustache. This led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were. The English accents, even to American ears, are outrageous. In summary, this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times. I have not seen Gigli or some of the other recent flops but this one, because of it's poor quality in every respect, must easily be worse then anything that mainstream Hollywood has put out.

There was a decent sized group of us, but we were seated right away. We started with the Flash Fried Brussel Sprouts. These were SO GOOD!! Everyone at the table enjoyed them. For my meal, I ordered the Block Burger with no bun, and was able to add a half salad instead of the fries. There's an upcharge of $3 to do this, but the salad is large! And it's only the half sized version! You chose between the Block salad or the Beet and Apple salad. I chose the Block which is almost like a Cobb salad. It was so fresh and tasty! The burger was cooked to perfection and exactly what I wanted. The staff were attentive, friendly, and personable. The restaurant itself was clean and the decor was nice. I would definitely visit again!", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "FAN.TAS.TIC! This place is the real deal, folks! A group of co-workers and I visited here for lunch this week.

{"original_text": "The only reason this restaurant doesn't get at least three or even four stars is because there isn't nary a single vegetarian entree on its menu. In a nation with an out-of-control obesity epidemic, not to mention heart disease and diabetes being major killers, what large restaurant these days doesn't have a single darn healthy entree from which its customers can choose? Mind you, what also adds insult to injury is that this is a hotel restaurant, so many of its patrons are stuck here (and stuck here, indeed- what other options are surrounded by this hotel, the Radisson @ Opryland? Shoney's, Bob Evans, McDonalds, and a seafood restaurant across the street. That's it.). What saves this place from only 1 star is that the night I was there, the chef on duty that night was *very* nice at coming out and making a special pasta entree for me (which was delish), though again, why don't the owners of this place just create a veggie burger option for lunch & a healthy vegetarian entree for dinner? Even the sides are very carb- and fake-cheez heavy, and the salads, well, guess what? All have meat as their centerpiece. P.S.- Am only saying'no' for kids, because, news flash- kids are getting stuffed like prize turkeys in this country, too, and deserve to have healthy food on the menu for them as well! Granted their parents would still probably order them fried this & cheezy and salty that, but there should still be a CHOICE. P.S.S. - Adding that, for breakfast, they actually used those rehydrated eggs-from-powder.... tasted like yellow chunks of chalk.

Nevertheless, if you are absorbed in the film like me, you will find this not a problem at all.I must say this is the best comedy I have ever seen. \"Shall We Dansu?\" is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. It is very different from Hollywood ones, e.g. Austin Powers or Scary Movies, in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes. Rather, it is light-hearted, a movie that makes you feel good.I love the movie because it makes me feel \"real\". The plot is straightforward yet pleasing. I was so delighted seeing that Sugiyama (the main role) has found the meaning of life in dancing. Before I watched the film I was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork. I felt lost. However, this film made me think of the bright side of life. I believed I was in the same boat of Sugiyama; if he could find himself in his hobby, why couldn't I? It reminded me of \"exploring my own future\" and discovering the happiness in my daily life.It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers. While some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect, I kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really \"alive\", learning to dance as the film goes on.Over all, this film is encouraging and heart-warming.

{"original_text": "There were a lot of things going against this movie for me before I watched it.First, I was a typical high school senior, in a Shakespeare class I didn't really even like, much less understood half of! Shakespeare would be no more than UNINTELLIGIBLE without me pouring ALL my concentration into his almost encrypted plays.... encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language..... and then I still wouldn't get most of it.Second, it was 4 hours long! I never thought that could be a good thing.Well let me tell you something. This movie was so masterful, so beautiful, I actually understood all the language as it was being performed. Now, the script was followed to the letter in this movie, the same script that was incomprehensible to me in Shakespeare class. And here I was my mind opening and me understanding it. I was doubting myself while watching the movie almost! But lo and behold.... when performed, and only then, Shakespeare comes to life. So this version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare is indeed a master, who wrote great stories. When I saw it on the big screen, especially in the high budget major motion picture style (with beautiful cinematography and photography), and acted amazingly by Brannagh and cast, somehow..... I understood what was going on. What was being said. The language is awesome and passionate. It allows for more raw emotion.... when words can't describe something, maybe Shakespeare's words can.I still hold to this day that Fist of The North Star (animated, english dub) is the greatest movie ever made. No movie provides more sheer entertainment. But for a movie to come close to dethroning Fist from that position (which Hamlet did -- it came close) is truly amazing..... awe inspiring. It wasn't a movie. It was an event.Even more amazing, it made me appreciate shakespeare. Wow. Powerful. Powerful is the word. One of the rare, TRULY powerful movies out there.This gets 2 hundred trillion stars out of infinity stars. Yes yes.By the way, all you kids out there in a Shakespeare class.... forget it.

{"original_text": "I was on my way to Pho & Beyond with my mom when I was like, \"Hey do you want to try'La Fusion' instead?\" So we gave it a shot. I gave it a 4 star for one reason: Crispy Duck. It was phenomenal. I asked for both sauces (thai curry / raspberry sauce) on the side - I definitely prefer the thai curry sauce while my mom mixed both sauces together. The duck was seriously cooked to perfection. We also had the shrimp pad thai - it was okay - it wasn't great but it wasn't bad. It's pad thai - I think the $18 price is a bit much for pad thai. The decor is really nice inside and the server was pleasant. I saw on the outside that there was a 2 course special - but the server never explained it to us or brought it up as an option. It's all good though. Cons: I think it's a bit overpriced given it's location. If we were in the city it would make sense, but not at Willow Grove. Lack of parking - maybe like 6 or 7 spots?

I gave it a 4 star for one reason: Crispy Duck. It was phenomenal. I asked for both sauces (thai curry / raspberry sauce) on the side - I definitely prefer the thai curry sauce while my mom mixed both sauces together. The duck was seriously cooked to perfection. We also had the shrimp pad thai - it was okay - it wasn't great but it wasn't bad. It's pad thai - I think the $18 price is a bit much for pad thai. The decor is really nice inside and the server was pleasant. I saw on the outside that there was a 2 course special - but the server never explained it to us or brought it up as an option. It's all good though. Cons: I think it's a bit overpriced given it's location. If we were in the city it would make sense, but not at Willow Grove. Lack of parking - maybe like 6 or 7 spots?

{"original_text": "LL Cool J performed much better in this movie that I expected! He did a fabulous job acting as a \"renegade\" cop within a \"renegade\" department. From the very beginning, he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he's in. He acts as a sort of \"gentle giant\" -- a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody, yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start -- and he does an amazing job. He was quite clearly the best character in the movie.This was certainly a performance that will not win Morgan Freeman any awards. After starring in powerhouse films like the Shawshank Redemption this film was certainly a step down. His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor -- and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner. There are so many ways his character (Moses Ashford) could have taken a more pivotal role. That he didn't was disappointing and a true let-down. I was hoping to see more from him in this film.Timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry. His portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive. This movie is a typical action movie that (at least initially) bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs LA has experienced in the past. Being an action movie, it has its share of shoot-em-up scenes, blood, and guts. These scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable. Watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end -- think of what you would typically expect in a good-cops/bad-cops conflict -- and it bears little resemblance to a REAL police shoot-out.What irked me most was the way Timberlake's character behaved during shoot-out scenes. He starts out having guns and not using them. Then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he's been firing a gun his whole life. Then he runs out of bullets and doesn't have a gun -- and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything -- suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns AND extra ammo?! Little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me.If what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay, then you'll probably love this movie. Personally, it doesn't matter to me what KIND of movie it is as long as it is realistic. Make me believe that the story is true.

The quality and freshness of the ingredients were evident in every bite, making it clear that V Sandwiches takes great pride in serving only the best. Aside from the outstanding Banh Mi, V Sandwiches also offers a range of other Vietnamese dishes that are equally impressive. The Pho, a traditional Vietnamese noodle soup, was rich and flavorful, with a fragrant broth that was perfectly balanced. The spring rolls were also a delight, with a crispy exterior and a mouthwatering filling of shrimp and vegetables. The service at V Sandwiches was top-notch. The staff was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. They were more than willing to answer any questions I had and made excellent recommendations.

{"original_text": "\"Maximum Overdrive\" is a high-octane thriller that leaves you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Directed by Stephen King himself, this film takes the concept of machines gone rogue to an entirely new level. The plot follows a group of survivors trying to escape a small town that has fallen victim to a global phenomenon where all machinery turns homicidal. One of the standout aspects of this movie is the intense and relentless action sequences. From killer trucks to lawnmowers and even vending machines, the film leaves no machine untouched in its quest to terrorize the characters. The special effects are surprisingly well-done for its time, with explosions, crashes, and on-screen carnage that will keep you visually engaged. In addition to the action, the film provides a good dose of suspense and tension. The constant threat of danger lurking around every corner keeps the audience on their toes, wondering who will be the next victim of the machines' wrath. The performances by the cast, including Emilio Estevez and Pat Hingle, are commendable, adding depth to the characters and making their survival all the more crucial. While \"Maximum Overdrive\" may not be a masterpiece in terms of storytelling or character development, it excels in its ability to entertain and deliver an adrenaline-fueled experience. It's a popcorn flick that successfully combines horror and action, leaving you entertained and satisfied.

One of the standout aspects of this movie is the intense and relentless action sequences. From killer trucks to lawnmowers and even vending machines, the film leaves no machine untouched in its quest to terrorize the characters. The special effects are surprisingly well-done for its time, with explosions, crashes, and on-screen carnage that will keep you visually engaged. In addition to the action, the film provides a good dose of suspense and tension. The constant threat of danger lurking around every corner keeps the audience on their toes, wondering who will be the next victim of the machines' wrath. The performances by the cast, including Emilio Estevez and Pat Hingle, are commendable, adding depth to the characters and making their survival all the more crucial. While \"Maximum Overdrive\" may not be a masterpiece in terms of storytelling or character development, it excels in its ability to entertain and deliver an adrenaline-fueled experience. It's a popcorn flick that successfully combines horror and action, leaving you entertained and satisfied. If you're a fan of thrilling and over-the-top movies, then \"Maximum Overdrive\" is definitely worth a watch."}

{"original_text": "The only reason I'm giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played Tadashi's tormentors were not up to the job. I presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy, but they were not well coached, and their scenes were a minor annoyance. I say not to judge this by U.S. standards because it's full of ambiguities and the kinds of equivocations that Japanese culture readily embraces, and is not beholden to the black-hat/ white-hat moral constraints U.S. kids' films are routinely subjected to. For example, there is a preciously funny moment when Tadashi's small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai, and Shojo--the avuncular Kirin herald--does what many a stressed-out Japanese adult would do. Hint: this would not happen in a Disney film. This picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids' movie. Early on, there's a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book. There was a TV commercial in Japan a couple years before this movie came out. It was a stop-motion clay animation about a kid who's depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room. His mother yells at him from downstairs to shut up.

I mention this commercial, because it was considered funny, and I didn't hear any objections to it while I was there. There is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in \"The Great Yokai War\" than one would find in a Disney movie. As a parent, if this were a U.S. film, I would be up in arms about such things, although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture, which, of course, are also not black and white. Since it's a Japanese movie, I accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a U.S. production.

{"original_text": "This review is LONG overdue! I visited Stitch-It in June 2013 In brief: Stitch it did an EXCELLENT job on my dress and I was extremely pleased. I needed it done in a rush and they were able to accommodate me. Given the tight turnaround, and the work that needed to be done, I didn't mind paying a premium. The service and results far exceeded my expectations. Complete Experience: I was attending a convention in Nashville, TN and had ordered an evening gown online a week before (admitted procrastinator tendencies). The gown was a navy blue Tadashi Shoji evening gown with sequins and an intricately designed lace and sheer layered bodice. The gown was a tad bit too long and there was a bulge in the back. The dress arrived a few days before I was scheduled to fly out to Nashville and I knew I wouldn't have time to get it tailored before leaving. I found a few Nashville area tailor shops on Yelp, read the reviews and decided I might try Stitch-It. I also saw a few cleaners that advertised they performed tailoring services, but they (quite frankly) didn't give me the warm and fuzzies. Stitch-It was about a 30 minute drive from the Gaylord Hotel where I was staying, so before taking a taxi that far, I decided to check with the hotel to see if they had an in-house tailor. When I took the dress to the Gaylord tailor/seamstress (who was the nicest lady ever), she looked at the gown and said \"I can hem the bottom....I'd have to do it by hand. The top part though....I won't touch that with a 10ft. pole!\" I laughed, but appreciated her honesty in not being able to handle the work that I needed done. I contacted Stitch-It and sent pictures of the dress via text message to a nice young man who's name I can't remember (I think it was Cameron...I could be wrong). They assured me that they should be able to accommodate me, so I hopped a cab and visited Stitch-It. When I arrived I was greeted by courteous and professional staff. I was shown to the dressing room and changed into my gown. My personal tailor was Maggie O'Neill and she was AWESOME! After the fitting and pinning, I left the gown and picked it up in two days. It fit perfectly and was well worth the fee. If I lived in Nashville, I would DEFINITELY use Stitch-It on a regular basis.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This review is LONG overdue!

Here's a short list of things that don't make any sense:1) A guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside. The guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside. Then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent - arriving the next morning?!? He was only 50 feet away!2) These two dunderheads then hear another girl scream (What, 100 feet away?), but don't investigate because they're afraid they'll get lost.3) Another guy and a girl are walking around, and in about their 10th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances, protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor. I mean, what the...? First off, that's just a really stupid thing to say, secondly he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together.4) A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and he stops her, telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing. Um, yeah, we kinda noticed she's wounded and not dead because she's up and walking around. But, thanks for that tidbit of information.5) One girl is tied up in Demonicus' lair, and when someone attempts to free her, she instead instructs this person to go and get help. Um, look, idiot, if she set you free, which would take about 5 seconds, there would be no need to get help.And it just goes on and on. The whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods, then they fight, then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends, then they wander around some more. It's just so damned boring and pointless that I turned the DVD off halfway through. None of these characters are sympathetic, especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time. Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him - he looks like a kid in a Halloween costume, scrunching his face up to look evil. He runs, or should I say scampers around like he's gay. The special effects are comedic, the acting is for the most part awful, and nothing makes any sense.Overall, maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it, getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue, creating characters with actual likable personalities, having some sort of logical flow to the action, and maybe even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit.

I tried their signature Caesar salad, and it was a refreshing and satisfying accompaniment to my pizza. The salad was made with crisp romaine lettuce, shaved parmesan, and a tangy Caesar dressing that was perfectly balanced. The service at Blaze Pizza was exceptional. The staff was friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable about the menu, making the ordering process a breeze. The restaurant itself had a clean and modern atmosphere, with ample seating both indoors and outdoors.

And I have always been disappointed. \"L'Intrus\" was no exception. She has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one. You get a lot of the Denis regulars: an older but still magnificent B\u00e9atrice Dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lips, the gap between her teeth, her ample cleavage, and a couple of nice coats; the black guy from \"Trouble Every Day\" and \"J'ai pas sommeil,\" Gr\u00e9goire Colin, and that Lithuanian or Russian girl.

There was certainly some action--gruesome murders, a man's search for a son--and there may even have been a plot, but one viewing wasn't enough to figure it out, and two viewings are, I fear, out of the question.

Oh, there were a few pretty shots, and if you liked \"Friday Evening\" with its shots of the folds in heavy drapes and bedsheets, you might appreciate the aesthetics of \"L'Intrus.\" Otherwise, steer clear. I saw this movie in French and it's possible I missed something crucial. But the dialogue in a Denis movie rarely amounts to more than five pages, double spaced and with ample margins.

They provide life jackets but no instruction on how to canoe, although we didn't ask. Honestly though, it is self explanatory and really you don't learn how to do it until you are actually in the boat experimenting anyway. I highly recommend bringing lunch, hat and water. I don't recommend swimming because the Harpeth runs up against lots of farm land, which means lots of run off, which means lots of pollution.

After a series of strange accidents and experiences in the house, Charles begins to believe that the creation my have come to life and is haunting him and his wife. Probably one of the better entries in the film, it's easily the creepiest. The atmosphere here is what sets it apart. The scenes with the fictional character are genuinely creepy, the mystery surrounding him is really effective and there's always a classic creep-out moment. The classic moment is the kill in the psychiatrist's office, which is an all-time high for creepiness. The build-up to it, with the creaking sounds, quick flashes of a mysterious being, and the thunder and lightning in the back ground work well for this one's favor.Sweets for the Sweet-Moving into a new house, widower John Reid, (Christopher Lee) hires former school teacher Ann Norton, (Nyree Dawn Porter) for his young daughter Jane, (Chloe Franks) while he's away on business. Ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from Jane's past, which John vehemently denies. When she learns the true nature of what has happened, it's far more shocking that what she could've thought possible. With the creepiest outright plot and the biggest twist of the stories, this is a quite pleasant entry. The mystery of the family is wonderfully played out, with small amounts of clues piled up here and there, and the final revelation is downright nerve-wracking. That part alone is the main reason why this one works, and Lee doesn't harm it either.The Bad Story(s): Waxwork-Tortured by memories of his lost love, Phillip Grayson, (Peter Cushing) and his friend Neville Rogers, (Joss Ackland) both become infatuated with a statue of a woman in a Wax Museum, as the statue takes over their lives, they discover a shocking secret about the museum that haunts the both of them. There's a clever premise here, and it does provide an excuse to spend time in a wax museum, which are always creepy. This is no exception, and it looks eerie, which is helped by the florescent lighting on display on the sculptures. A dream sequence provides a great moment of suspense, but what ultimately kills this one is the slow pace. It takes a long time for events to unfold out, and most of the time is spent on exposition. It also builds up to a shock ending that can be seen coming from a mile away. Those really lower this one a bit. Had the twist been changed, it would've scored higher, the rest is acceptable.The Cloak-Veteran horror film actor Paul Henderson, (Jon Pertwee) upset at the lack of realism on the set of his new film, goes off and buys a new vampire cloak from a specialty store.

Unconvinced the cloak is the cause, he does everything he can to prove it's just in his imagination. This has a pretty decent premise, and there is plenty of opportunity for some decent scares, but what sinks it is several factors. First, it's just too goofy for it's own good. The plot twist at the end is a perfect example, which is so overdone that it's not really a shock at all, and just comes across as just plain silly. There's so few scenes of scares or attempted scares that it's just a bore to sit through.

{"original_text": "I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his love of the American people and the land. In A River Runs Through It, Redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot).Redford's cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years.What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands. Given the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his love of the American people and the land.

Yes, even they got their hands into low exploitation sickies like this, and Bamboo is definitely among the worse attempts of the whole genre, even when compared to the Western attempts that usually pale in comparison with the Eastern films!The story is about a Japanese war camp in which the Chinese women are brutalized, abused and raped by the bad Japanese (what else?) during the World War II. The girls also know a secret place in which a box full of gold is hidden and also learn that a Chinese military officer raised in Japan (Shaw veteran Lo Lieh) is actually now an undercover agent among the other Japanese and naturally helps the girls escape the hell. What follows is sequences full of gratuitous nudity, female kung fu, some nasty torture, gore, sleaze and extremely offensive anti Japan attitude that make this film pure and honest garbage that doesn't even try to be more than it is.There are hardly any interesting elements in Bamboo House of Dolls. The occasional photography especially at the end looks nice with its sunbeams and beautiful nature but that's about it in the merits department. The fight scenes are plenty and always include half naked females hitting and kicking each other. The violence overall is quite nasty at times with several bullet wounds, misogynistic torture scenes (for example, one poor girl is brutalized on the floor filled with broken glass etc.) and extremely repulsive ending and moral behind it. Of course it is stupid to talk about \"moral\" when writing about this kind of film, but still there are elements I won't accept to be found from any film.The film has also some enjoyable turkey elements for sure! For example, the gold box, filled with heavy gold, seems suspiciouly light as the weak and suffered girls don't seem to have any problems lifting and moving it, not to speak of throwing it! Also those numerous \"skin fight scenes\" make this quite smile inducing for fans of trash cinema. I have seen the same director's Killer Snakes (1973) which is ten times more noteworthy as a piece and even though it has many alive snakes killed for real, it is also visually more interesting and shows us some nasty sides of the other side of the big city and society. Also, it is a must for those who fear snakes.Bamboo House of Dolls has suffered some censorship, too, which isn't a surprise considered the subject matter. The uncut version, (dubbed into a non-English language) released in Europe at least in France, Italy and Switzerland, runs 104 PAL minutes while the cut, English dubbed print released in Holland, Belgium and Greece runs only 84 minutes in PAL. From what I've heard, the cut scenes are not only violence or other graphic stuff but also dialogue and \"plot development\" and the like.Bamboo House of Dolls is garbage cinema in its most trashy form and definitely something I wouldn't have liked to see from the Shaw Brothers or Hong Kong in general.

It's nothing sensational but some small hint of great things to come for Spielberg can be seen in this movie. The movie is basically in the same style as most of Spierlberg's'70's movies and TV works. So that means that some characters tend to show some quirkiness's and no I'm not just talking about the Columbo character alone. The kind of character quirkiness which perhaps can be best seen in the 1975 Spielberg movie \"Jaws\". But other than some small hints of typical early Spielberg elements, you can't call this movie the work of- and fine example of a rising director star. Not that its bad, of course it isn't but as I said earlier, it also isn't anything too sensational.This movie began really well and very promising but after it's fine opening, in which as always the murder occurred, the movie became sort of more slow and also dull to watch. Dull because it's mostly a Columbo movie by the book that doesn't have real memorable moments in it, not dull because it's a boring movie to watch.The murder itself was quite ingenious and the concept of having a crime story writer murdering his writing partner showed some great and interesting potential. The story however didn't really explored all of its possibilities. At least that's the feeling this movie left me with.The movie was still a good one to watch nevertheless thanks to the character of Jack Cassidy, who thinks he's smarter then Columbo, due to his mystery/crime writing experience and tries to give him all kinds of possible hints, leading away from himself. But of course Columbo knows better and he is his number one suspect from the first moment on but he as usual plays the game along.The movie does have a good overall style and uses some fine camera position and editing.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This is the Columbo that got directed by Steven Spielberg at an early point in his career.

Directed by Sergei Eisenstein and released in 1925, \"Battleship Potemkin\" is a revolutionary work of art that revolutionized the language of cinema.

The film tells the story of the 1905 mutiny aboard the Russian battleship Potemkin and the subsequent events that occurred, highlighting the oppressive conditions and the people's fight against injustice.

The acting from the two leads is terrific. Scott Wilson (still one of the most underrated actors ever) is chilling as the nihilistic leader, one who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake is also chilling as the more submissive of the two and the one with a conscience. His character obviously has a voice of reason, but is terrified to go against Wilson (theres a good amount of homoerotic subtext on his character's part).

{"original_text": "\"And Justice for All\" is a gripping courtroom drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Director Norman Jewison masterfully crafts a story that explores the dark underbelly of the justice system, exposing its flaws and hypocrisies with unflinching honesty. Al Pacino delivers a powerhouse performance as Arthur Kirkland, a defense attorney who finds himself caught in a web of corruption and moral dilemmas. Pacino's portrayal is nothing short of extraordinary, capturing the complexities of his character with intensity and nuance. His fiery courtroom speeches are the stuff of legend, leaving you hanging onto every word. The script, penned by Barry Levinson and Valerie Curtin, is a true masterpiece.

{"original_text": "This movie is rated a classic on sentiment not on any quality of movie-making. It moves from the unlikely to the unbelievable, from the unrealistic to the ludicrous.The unbelievable plot revolves around an attempt by two British soldiers and a Hindu gofer to rescue a third soldier who has been captured by insurgent Indians. In the later scene we see a full regiment with drum and bagpipes marching into an ambush. In the British army, a sergeant does not order up a rescue attempt, and if you get past that, he does not attempt it with only one other soldier and an Indian servant when there is a full regiment on hand. The Indian insurgents are so incredibly inept it is laughable...there are hundreds of them but they can't hold their prisoner or kill the two rescuers, of course not. At one point we see the British soldiers throwing blocks of stone down from the battlements at the insurgents, who are scattered around the mountainside in ambush...one would have to have an eggplant for a brain to think this would do any damage. After Cary Grant as the rescued prisoner is shot, he lies on the floor looking around at the water boy...hardly the actions of someone who has been shot in the back. The water boy bravely blows a bugle (which comes from nowhere) to sound the alarm...this he does by standing up high on a wall so he can be seen and shot by the bad guys, and we shed a tear as he keeps trying to sound more notes as he is repeatedly shot and the bugle call breaks up into feeble squawks...instead of blowing the bugle while hiding behind cover as anybody with half a brain would do.

{"original_text": "This is possibly the worst film I've ever seen. The fact that it has a flimsy storyline is bad enough, that they've hooked it around the subject of football violence makes it 100 times worse.I had severe doubts about the premise of this film even before I started watching, but went into it open minded enough even to accept the way that the writers saw fit to introduce Elijah Wood's character Matt into the hooligan scene.But the film throws up inaccuracy after inaccuracy, to the point that by the middle of the film each one makes you cringe harder than the time before.Let's clear up a few things: Hooligans don't tend to virtually smash up their own pub before a run-of-the-mill league game; they don't set out to kill each other; they don't ONLY wear Stone Island (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not, do). They most certainly don't, when having taken exception to a new firm member, trot off to their rival firms territory for pie and mash. And I'd love to meet the hool who would go and grass on his firm's top boy to the rival firm. (Although you can scratch what I said about setting to out kill each other if one does exist).Don't get me wrong,I'm yet to see a film on the subject that doesn't contain some fantasy whims, but this is on a par with The Firm for cluelessness.I found it ironical that Wood's American nemesis is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user, when this is part and parcel of the British hooligan scene. The film chooses not to challenge Wood's morals and instead steers clear of any of the firm using coke.I could go on, but I think I've made my point.As for the plot, it's highly unimaginative, and I'm sure if I hadn't spent the entire film bemoaning the points, and more, made above then I would have guessed what was going on sooner than I did. And believe me, I was well in front.I get the distinct impression this film is aimed at men, with the hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional issues that are raised.If I'm right, then the makers have failed completely. It's too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene, and I can't believe the kind of female who looks for emotive films would give a damn about any of the characters given their violent tendencies.Are there any good points? Maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but I'm rarely impressed by slow-mo action, certainly not when it's a fight as the point is a ruck is rousing enough anyway.There are some funny, if unrealistic moments. Wood's trip to school did raise a smile for me. But a few mildly funny moments hardly make up for watching two hours of complete fabricated dross.If you're British avoid like the plague, if only not to further develop misconceptions of the scene if you're not in the know.

I could be wrong about the reason, but they are hard none-the-less. They also have a few pre-made hot items. The hot dogs are okay. But it's hard to mess up a hot dog.

{"original_text": "Over Christmas break, a group of college friends stay behind to help prepare the dorms to be torn down and replaced by apartment buildings. To make the work a bit more difficult, a murderous, Chucks-wearing psycho is wandering the halls of the dorm, preying on the group in various violent ways.Registered as one of the 74'video nasties' listed by the U.K. in the 1980s, The Dorm That Dripped Blood had a good reputation built up for it prior to first viewing. The term'video nasty' strikes into mind some images of some great explicit gore, violence, sex, etc.: All the things a horror fan dreams of. So, after hearing all of that info, I settled into Pranks (alt. title) expecting a sleazy slasher experience.... and that's what it tried to be, but failed pretty much completely. Visually, the film's not great. The cinematography, gore (except for a couple scenes), and overall direction all fail. It's simply not enjoyable to watch. The unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason (like the opening kill). There are some cool death scenes, including a pretty nice face melt (which can be seen on the poster), but that's about it for the positive. The acting is pretty bad, the story seems unimportant, the killer isn't cool or scary, and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid: it's a bit boring. Overall, for a film done by a few UCLA film students for $90,000 (which would be over double that today), The Dorm That Dripped Blood isn't a total mess. It has a couple good things, and is fairly watchable.... But, as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like The House on Sorority Row and Pieces.... it just cannot compare.

{"original_text": "\"Killer's Kiss\" is a gritty and atmospheric noir film that will leave you breathless from start to finish. Directed by the legendary Stanley Kubrick, this hidden gem takes us on a journey through the seedy underbelly of New York City, where danger lurks in every shadow. The story centers around Davey Gordon, a down-on-his-luck boxer who falls for a beautiful dancer named Gloria. Their connection is instant and intense, but their love is threatened by Gloria's menacing and possessive employer, Vincent Rapallo. As tensions rise and violence ensues, Davey must fight not only for his own survival but also to protect the woman he loves. What sets \"Killer's Kiss\" apart is Kubrick's masterful direction, capturing the grimy and claustrophobic atmosphere of the city with stunning black-and-white cinematography. The use of shadows and tight close-ups adds an extra layer of tension to the already suspenseful plot. The film's pacing is impeccable, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout. The performances by the cast are equally impressive. Jamie Smith as Davey Gordon delivers a compelling portrayal of a man trapped in a dangerous situation, torn between his passions and the harsh reality of his circumstances. Irene Kane shines as Gloria, exuding both vulnerability and strength in equal measure. While \"Killer's Kiss\" may not be as well-known as Kubrick's later works, it showcases the director's early talent and foreshadows the brilliance that would define his career. If you're a fan of classic film noir or simply appreciate a well-crafted thriller, this is a must-watch.

{"original_text": "They lose a star for having TWO STORES on essentially the same road...one on the far northeast side and one on the far northwest side. Really, Trader Joe? Your stores are all over the place in other cities, like Chicago, DC, San Francisco......but southside Indy gets ZERO...downtown Indy NONE. That's not cool, Joe. Not cool at all. However, the employees are pretty useful and cool (and sometimes even funny). The food is affordable. I like that it doesn't take me 15 minutes to get through the store because it's petite. LOVE the products. Once I got a spoiled piece of salmon, and they cheerfully refunded me and I didn't have to bring back the gross fish. I like the free samples (last night I had a bite of pumpkin pie). LOVE that I can have a cheese party without going broke. Their low-budget beers and wines are fantastic for cooking and fairly passable for drinking if you need to buy in bulk and your friends aren't super snobby about booze. Kefir, non-dairy milks, organic products, cheese are generally much cheaper here than at other grocery chains or gourmet stores. Their frozen foods are very good and the MorningStar Farms sausage links' everyday price is equivalent to the super sale price at other grocery stores. I am particularly fond of the somewhat-strange party snacks, although they are much pricier than at Saraga. Trader Joe's is a great place to find food to \"cheat\" with if you're not much of a cook or are pressed for time. For example, you can buy an already-seasoned tri-tip to use for your steak fajitas. You can find pre-marinated chicken to put on the grill. They also sell many pre-cooked foods that you just have to microwave...if you can't cook at all. In conclusion, start writing letters, people!

{"original_text": "After \"Star Wars: A New Hope\" redefined science fiction, and \"The Empire Strikes Back\" redefined \"Star Wars\", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job. The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war. There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor. When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion. This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader. It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them. There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well. With the light tone of \"A New Hope\" and the more sinnister tone of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale. The Special Edition for \"Return of the Jedi\" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it. Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense. Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved. It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film.

This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader. It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them. There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well. With the light tone of \"A New Hope\" and the more sinnister tone of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale. The Special Edition for \"Return of the Jedi\" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it. Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense. Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved. It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film. A THIRD must-see for film fans."}

That didn't sound very hopeful, and alas, it was worse than I'd suspected.A laddish Robin I can take; a Robin who tangles with a pert dyer's daughter I can credit; but a Robin who exchanges not-very-funny banter with his single henchman is harder to swallow, and a Robin and *entire cast* who seem to be having difficulty managing their lines is the kiss of doom. How could anyone let such laboured delivery pass without re-shooting the scenes?

You just have to come and hear these. One of the docents has a great blog, by the way, called Distilled History. Here's a link: http://www.distilledhistory.com/ He noted in one of his blogs you can visit this house many times and have a very different experience depending on the guide. Some are more focused on architecture, some on the family, some on St. Louis history, so you'll get a few new storied every time. I would have given five stars, but we showed up ten minutes or so into the tour, missed the first room and never got back to hear about it (it was amazing). I think I would have preferred waiting for the next tour. I'll be back to hear about that front room and some more stories. I'm thinking Christmastime would be ideal."}

{"original_text": "\"The Long Goodbye\" is a masterful work of crime fiction that transcends the genre with its complex characters and thought-provoking themes. Raymond Chandler weaves a twisted web of deception, corruption, and moral ambiguity, keeping readers on the edge of their seats from beginning to end. The novel follows Philip Marlowe, a hard-boiled private detective, as he becomes entangled in a case that starts with a simple request to find a missing friend and quickly escalates into a labyrinthine mystery. Chandler's writing is sharp and evocative, immersing readers in the gritty underbelly of 1950s Los Angeles. His vivid descriptions bring the city to life, with its seedy bars, glamorous mansions, and morally bankrupt characters. What sets \"The Long Goodbye\" apart from other crime novels is Chandler's exploration of existential themes. Marlowe grapples with questions of personal identity, loyalty, and the true nature of goodness in a corrupt world. The characters he encounters are deeply flawed, their motivations murky and often contradictory. As the plot unfolds, the lines between right and wrong blur, leaving readers questioning their own ethical compass. Chandler's prose is both poetic and hard-hitting, filled with memorable one-liners and clever wordplay. His dialogue crackles with wit and cynicism, capturing the essence of the noir genre. Each sentence is carefully crafted, revealing layers of meaning beneath the surface. \"The Long Goodbye\" is a timeless classic that showcases Chandler's unparalleled talent for storytelling. It is a gripping and thought-provoking read that will leave readers pondering its themes long after they turn the final page.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "\"The Long Goodbye\" (Little, Brown and Co.), by Raymond Chandler: One of the most iconic noir novels of all time, Raymond Chandler's \"TheLong Goodbye\" is a classic that will leave readers pondering its themes long after they turn the final page.

Our waitress was extremely friendly and told us to check out the specials they were offering. We ordered Bloody Marys and Mimosas and they were delicious! I especially enjoyed the Bloody Mary. We ordered the fried green tomatoes eggs benedict and crab cake eggs benedict. They were both so delicious. The crab cakes were huge and full of delicious crab! The poached egg was perfect, I literally almost licked my plate clean. The home fries on the side were super amazing too, the seasoning on it was just enough and had the perfect crunch. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his fried green tomatoes as well. I was able to get a quick bite and I can see why!

John Billingsley is Brilliant as the alien Dr. Phlox, and Jolene Blalock is totally luscious as the tempting but logical Vulcan science officer T'Pol.

{"original_text": "Watch On The Rhine started as a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still bound to Nazi Germany by that infamous non-aggression pact signed in August of 1939. So much for the fact that Hellman was merely echoing the Communist party line, the line didn't change until a couple of months later. Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work.The play Watch On The Rhine ran from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson as the butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest son, Lucile Watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas.Lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and the New York Film Critics for Best Actor. Probably if the Tony Awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well. The Oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy, and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was. Lukas's nomination is usually the kind the Academy gives to round out a field.Jack Warner knew that which is why Mady Christians did not repeat her Broadway part and the role of Lukas's wife was given to Bette Davis. Davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her, but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it. It's the same reason she did The Man Who Came To Dinner, a much lighter play than this one.Davis is the daughter of a late American Supreme Court Justice who married a German national back in the Weimar days. After many years of being vagabonds on the continent of Europe, Davis Lukas, and their three children come to America which has not yet entered the European War. They're made welcome by Lucile Watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren.The fly in this ointment are some other house guests, a friend of Davis's from bygone days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe, a Rumanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris. Coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects Lukas's anti-fascist background. His suspicions are quite correct, it's the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they've become. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there. His health has not been the same since. His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes. Those decisions affect all the other members of the cast.Adding quite a bit more to the Broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was Dashiell Hammett who was Lillian Hellman's significant other. Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy was a Hammett creation with such loathsome types as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders.Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account Runmanian count. He was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the Nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after Stalingrad.Lucile Watson was up for Best Supporting Actress in 1943, but lost to Katina Paxinou in For Whom The Bell Tolls.

The movie follows a chilling narrative where a group of high-ranking Nazis, led by the infamous Dr. Josef Mengele, plot to recreate Adolf Hitler through cloning. Mengele, played hauntingly by Gregory Peck, meticulously selects and manipulates surrogate mothers to carry the cloned embryos in various parts of the world. As the plot unfolds, we witness the efforts of a Nazi hunter, played by Sir Laurence Olivier, to foil this diabolical plan. The tension builds, and the movie takes us on a journey filled with suspense, mystery, and ethical dilemmas. What struck me most was the film's exploration of the nature vs. nurture debate.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "A few weeks ago, I went to see a film called \"The Boys from Brazil\", and I have to say, it was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, if not for the amount of time it took me to get through the whole thing (which I'm not sure I have ever done before, but I'll give you a heads up, it's not long)."}
{"original_text": "Bela Lugosi is not typecast in this fantastic twelve-part adventure serial, playing the lead as Frank Chandler/Chandu the Magician, enjoying his role as a representative of the forces of White Magic pushed against those of Black, while displaying vigourous fighting skill, successfully wooing a young Egyptian princess, and cutting a lean and dashing figure in yachting gear, complete with nautical cap.

{"original_text": "Herbet Clutter, wife Bonnie, and their teenage children Kenyon and Nancy were much liked and respected in their tiny town of Holcomb, Kansas--but in the early hours of 14 November 1959 all four were brutally murdered. Rather unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on author Truman Capote, who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to its conclusion. The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD. Controversial, shocking, and exceptionally well-written, it became an international best seller and it remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day.The 1967 film version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself. Filmed in black and white in many of the real-life locations, it has a slightly documentary quality, icy and detached--and the overall cast is exceptional. This is the film on which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor rests, and deservedly so. As killer Perry Smith, Blake traps you between a profound distaste and the shock of unexpected sympathy; it is a masterful performance from start to finish. As Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less fine.Like Capote's book, the film opens with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and brings them to the Clutter home--only to suddenly flash past the crime to detail the investigation that finally resulted in their arrest and conviction. The centerpiece of the film has always been the moment at which we at last see what occurred in the Clutter home; actually filmed in the Clutter house itself, it is a spinechilling sequence, horrific and deeply disturbing.Director and writer Richard Brooks guides the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation, erring only in the sense that he allows the film to become slightly preachy.

{"original_text": "This was basically an attempt to do the same thing with \"Batman\" that was done with \"Gilligan's Island\" in \"Surviving Gilligan's Island.\" For those of you who missed it (and shame!) \"Surviving Gilligan's Island\" (full title: \"Surviving Gilligan's Island: The Incredibly True Story of the Longest Three Hour Tour in History\") was a special from a few years back, where Bob Denver (\"Gilligan\"), Dawn Wells (\"Mary Ann\") and Russell Johnson (\"The Professor\") related the story of the show's creation, cancellation, rediscovery & rebirth. Along the way, stories were dramatized with actors portraying the original cast and crew. It was very well done. It was funny, well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show.\"Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt\" is in a similar style. The re-telling of the history of the show, the re-enactments, the general feel are all the same. What's missing is the straightforward approach that \"Surviving\" took.In \"Return\", Adam West and Burt Ward both receive invitations to a car show to which they were not meant to be invited. After being allowed to stay, Adam and Burt witness the theft of the centerpiece of the show: the legendary Batmobile! Adam and Burt decide to chase after it themselves, leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show. This eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the Batmobile and why.Choosing to use this conceit (actually having a plot) is the biggest letdown of this show. Unlike \"Surviving\", \"Return\" forces the viewer to follow a less interesting storyline (the theft of the Batmobile) instead of focusing all its attention on what the audience would most be interested in (the history of the show.) It is the historical sections that work the best. The casting (as in \"Surviving\") is excellent. Jack Brewer (\"Adam West\") and Jason Marsden (\"Burt Ward\") capture the feel of the actors without looking *too* much like them. Brett Rickaby (\"Frank Gorshin\") bears a stronger resemblance to his subject, but captures none of the late Gorshin's charm, only his characterizations. Other actors' portrayals are short and functional, with none standing out as especially good or bad. Many of the stories have been told before, but they mostly play out amusingly, with only the occasional clunky presentation. Another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of Lyle Waggoner's tryout for the part of Batman. The only place where the flashbacks fail is when they insert obviously made up plot points to advance the main story. This downgrades the accuracy of the flashbacks needlessly.The \"main plot\" (if that is what we must call it) is, of course, ludicrous. This is not really a fault in and of itself, but it's just not carried off well enough to cover up the shortfall. Strong performances and good writing can make up for a silly plot (especially in these kinds of things) but we really get neither, here. The performances by West and Ward seem somewhat flat (even for them); the dialog too carefully written for it to feel natural. Again, I think the comparison to \"Surviving Gilligan's Island\" can be seen in that the dialog is mostly just there to set up a flashback. In \"Surviving\", that's all it intends to be. In \"Return\" it tries to do double duty and, unfortunately, often fails. Gorshin and Newmar do well (although I agree with others that Gorshin had not aged well and that Newmar had - and what's Waggoner taking to look that good?) but aren't given enough to do. Again, I think they all would have been better served by a more straightforward presentation than the one chosen here.Another odd point about \"Return\". This special is about the \"Batman\" TV series and its history, yet all the clips shown are from the theatrical movie. Even the Waggoner footage is technically movie footage. If you know you're \"Bat-history\", then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first, only to be delayed in favor of the TV show when CBS needed to fill time fast. So when Waggoner and West were testing for the role, it was for the movie, not the TV show. Why \"Return\" only uses movie footage is unclear. It most probably has to do with rights issues, but it is a distinct distraction to those in the know: seeing Julie Newmar in the present, but only footage of Lee Meriwether as Catwoman in the past.Overall, I liked the show, mainly for the flashbacks. I would have preferred the style used in \"Surviving Gilligan's Island\", but I can understand why they'd want a more story-oriented piece given the subject matter. Besides, I like these people. It's nice to see them out and about, still having fun with one of the great pieces of entertainment history. I just wish they had done it a little better and when more of the original cast was still alive to be there.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "This was basically an attempt to do the same thing with \"Batman\" that was done with \"Gilligan's Island\" in \"Surviving Gilligan's Island.\" For those of you who missed it (and shame!) \"Surviving Gilligan's Island\" (full title: \"Surviving Gilligan's Island: The Incredibly True Story of the Longest Three Hour Tour in History\") was a special from a few years back, where Bob Denver (\"Gilligan\"), Dawn Wells (\"Mary Ann\") and Russell Johnson (\"The Professor\") related the story of the show's creation, cancellation, rediscovery & rebirth.

It was funny, well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show.\"Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt\" is in a similar style. The re-telling of the history of the show, the re-enactments, the general feel are all the same. What's missing is the straightforward approach that \"Surviving\" took.In \"Return\", Adam West and Burt Ward both receive invitations to a car show to which they were not meant to be invited. After being allowed to stay, Adam and Burt witness the theft of the centerpiece of the show: the legendary Batmobile! Adam and Burt decide to chase after it themselves, leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show. This eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the Batmobile and why.Choosing to use this conceit (actually having a plot) is the biggest letdown of this show. Unlike \"Surviving\", \"Return\" forces the viewer to follow a less interesting storyline (the theft of the Batmobile) instead of focusing all its attention on what the audience would most be interested in (the history of the show.) It is the historical sections that work the best. The casting (as in \"Surviving\") is excellent. Jack Brewer (\"Adam West\") and Jason Marsden (\"Burt Ward\") capture the feel of the actors without looking *too* much like them. Brett Rickaby (\"Frank Gorshin\") bears a stronger resemblance to his subject, but captures none of the late Gorshin's charm, only his characterizations. Other actors' portrayals are short and functional, with none standing out as especially good or bad. Many of the stories have been told before, but they mostly play out amusingly, with only the occasional clunky presentation. Another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of Lyle Waggoner's tryout for the part of Batman. The only place where the flashbacks fail is when they insert obviously made up plot points to advance the main story. This downgrades the accuracy of the flashbacks needlessly.The \"main plot\" (if that is what we must call it) is, of course, ludicrous. This is not really a fault in and of itself, but it's just not carried off well enough to cover up the shortfall. Strong performances and good writing can make up for a silly plot (especially in these kinds of things) but we really get neither, here. The performances by West and Ward seem somewhat flat (even for them); the dialog too carefully written for it to feel natural. Again, I think the comparison to \"Surviving Gilligan's Island\" can be seen in that the dialog is mostly just there to set up a flashback. In \"Surviving\", that's all it intends to be. In \"Return\" it tries to do double duty and, unfortunately, often fails. Gorshin and Newmar do well (although I agree with others that Gorshin had not aged well and that Newmar had - and what's Waggoner taking to look that good?) but aren't given enough to do. Again, I think they all would have been better served by a more straightforward presentation than the one chosen here.Another odd point about \"Return\". This special is about the \"Batman\" TV series and its history, yet all the clips shown are from the theatrical movie. Even the Waggoner footage is technically movie footage. If you know you're \"Bat-history\", then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first, only to be delayed in favor of the TV show when CBS needed to fill time fast. So when Waggoner and West were testing for the role, it was for the movie, not the TV show. Why \"Return\" only uses movie footage is unclear. It most probably has to do with rights issues, but it is a distinct distraction to those in the know: seeing Julie Newmar in the present, but only footage of Lee Meriwether as Catwoman in the past.Overall, I liked the show, mainly for the flashbacks. I would have preferred the style used in \"Surviving Gilligan's Island\", but I can understand why they'd want a more story-oriented piece given the subject matter. Besides, I like these people. It's nice to see them out and about, still having fun with one of the great pieces of entertainment history. I just wish they had done it a little better and when more of the original cast was still alive to be there."}

{"original_text": "\"A Damsel in Distress\" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's better musicals. But even Astaire's bad films always had some good moments.In \"Damsel,\" Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is in London on a personal appearance tour. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers.Jerry believes that Alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. He tries to rescue her from her family's country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor Lady Alice will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner) the conniving butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet.This musical has numerous problems. First, there is the plot, based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). The story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. When Fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert conniving against them and each other.The butler and the house boy are especially irritating. They are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. You wish they would get off the screen and let Fred dance.Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. She has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.George Burns and Gracie Allen are along for the ride, as Jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. The duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times.The direction of the movie by George Stevens is not well done. At times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in London, not Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the plus side, the songs by George and Ira Gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. And of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan.But the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. At times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (At one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) The numbers include: \uf0b7 \"I'm Dancing and I Can't Be Bothered Now\" -- Fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled London street. He does some great \"cane-twirling\" with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical, \"Crazy For You,\" Harry Groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.)\uf0b7 \"Put Me To The Test\" -- Fred, George, and Gracie do a trio tap dance in an English cottage. George and Gracie match Fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason.\uf0b7 \"Stiff Upper Lip\" (The Fun House Number) -- At an amusement park fun house, Fred, George, and Gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. It's the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times.\uf0b7 \"Things Are Looking Up\" -- Fred and Joan Fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. Fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer.\uf0b7 \"A Foggy Day in London Town\" -- Fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London. At times, he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself.\uf0b7 \"Nice Work If You Can Get It\" -- A great song that is misused in the movie. During a social event at the manor house, Fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. Each time Fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. (Again, Harry Groener did a better dance number with this song in \"Crazy For You.\") \uf0b7 \"Drum Dance Number\" -- As Fred and Joan are eloping, Fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. As usual, it's a great dance number. But there's absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie.The most contrived moment in the film comes when Fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. As he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that's right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.The movie is worth owning on DVD for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote.

What ensures Ned Kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him. During several battles, he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron, off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce. Indeed, it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the Victorian police who noticed he hadn't plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged. The story has been told in schools and histories of Australia for so long that some permutations of the story have, ironically, become boring. The more the stories try to portray Kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster, the less people pay attention.Which is where this adaptation of Our Sunshine, a novel about the Kelly legend, excels. Rather than attempting to portray a Ned Kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore, the film quickly establishes him as a human being. Indeed, the reversal of the popular legend, showing the corruption of the Victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists, goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd. Here, Ned Kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder, one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it. No, I am not making that up. About the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the Irish versus English mentality of the battles. While the Kelly gang were distinctly Irish, Australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly (a scene with some Chinese migrants highlights this).Heath Ledger does an amazing job of impersonating Australia's most notorious outlaw. It is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching Ledger and not Kelly himself. Orlando Bloom has finally found a role in which he doesn't look completely lost without his bow, and Geoffrey Rush's appearance as the leader of the police contingent at Glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state. But it is Naomi Watts, appearing as Julia Cook, who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film. Although the film basically implies that Cook was essentially the woman in Ned Kelly's life, but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here. Indeed, a lot of the film's hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze-dried than explorative. Once the element of police corruption is established, in fact, the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed.Unfortunately, most of the film's strengths are not capitalised upon. Rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits. Ditto for Watts, and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins. I can only conclude that another fifteen, or even thirty, minutes of footage might have fixed this. But that leads to the other problem, in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact. One scene manages to do the speech-making thing well, but unfortunately, it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while. If one were to believe the impression that this film creates, a matter of weeks, even days, passes between the time that Ned Kelly becomes a wanted man on the say-so of one corrupt policeman, and the infamous shootout at Glenrowan. Annoyingly, the trial and execution of Ned Kelly is not even depicted here, simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll.That said, aside from some shaky camera-work at times, Ned Kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts, and it has a good beginning. For that reason, I rated it a seven out of ten. Other critics have not been so kind, so if you're not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements (and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout?), then you might be better off looking elsewhere.

{"original_text": "\"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" is an emotionally gripping masterpiece that takes you on a harrowing journey through the dark underbelly of the human spirit. This Depression-era drama immerses you in a world of desperation, where hope and dreams are replaced by a relentless fight for survival.

The dimly lit rooms, calming music, and aromatic scents enhanced the overall experience. The cleanliness of the center was also impressive, with well-maintained facilities and sanitized equipment. Furthermore, Ralston Massage Center offers a wide range of services beyond traditional massage therapy. They also provide physical therapy, which is a great addition for those seeking rehabilitation or pain relief. The center truly caters to the holistic health and well-being of their clients.

{"original_text": "In a famous essay he wrote about Charles Dickens, George Orwell points out that many readers always regretted that Dickens never continued writing like he did in PICKWICK PAPERS: that is, he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career. This would not have been too difficult for Dickens. His contemporary Robert Surtees did precisely that, only concentrating on the misadventures of the fox hunting set (MR. FANCY ROMFORD'S HOUNDS is a title of one of his novels). Among hunters and horse lovers Surtees still has a following but most people find his novels unreadable. Dickens was determined to show he was more than a funny man (and don't forget, his first book, SKETCHES BY BOZ, was also a funny book). So Dickens third book is OLIVER TWIST (which got pretty grim at points). Orwell says that for any author to grow they have to change the style of their books. Dickens would definitely (and successfully) have agreed to that.But Orwell overlooked the genre writer who transcends his fellows. Surtees, as I said, is a genre writer concentrating on hunting - but not everyone is interested in hunting. But P.G.Wodehouse saw himself as an entertainer, poking fun at the upper reaches of the British social system. His Earl of Emsworth is prouder of raising the finest pig in England than being...well Earl of Emsworth! His Psmith is always prepared to counterattack when he is supposed to be submissive to an unfair superior. His Stanley Uckridge will always have a \"perfect\" scheme that should net a huge profit (but always manages to come apart at the end). And best of all, his Jeeves will always put his brilliant brain to work rescuing the inept Bertie Wooster, his boss. Since Wodehouse had a limited view of his mission as a writer - he was there to do cartoon figures of fun for the entertainment of the world - his books never lost their glow. They served (and still serve) their purposes. In fact, compared Wodehouse with his far more serious contemporary Evelyn Waugh, who also wrote funny books, but of a more intellectual type. The best of Waugh remains among the high points of 20th Century British literature: BRIDESHEAD REVISITED, DECLINE AND FALL, and the rest. But in his determination to make his points, if his points failed to interest the reader the book frequently collapsed. For every VILE BODIES there was some failure late in his career like THE ORDEAL OF GILBERT PINFOLD. While Wodehouse could do lesser hack work too, his falling did not go as far as Waugh's did.Wodehouse also was a gifted lyricist (when you hear \"Bill\" in the score of SHOWBOAT, it is not Kern and Hammerstein's tune, but Kern and Wodehouse's tune transposed from \"Oh Lady, Lady\" a dozen years earlier). He was a handy dramatist too. So it is pleasing to see that he took his novel A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS and turned it into the screenplay here.It has the normal Wodehouse touches. That perfect butler Keggs (Reginald Gardiner in a wonderful performance) is a scoundrel in rigging a \"friendly\" gambling game of chance among the staff of the stately home he heads. He is also unable to refrain, occasionally, from singing Italian opera - despite Constance Collier's attempts to control his impulse. This is typical Wodehouse characterization. So is the way the love affair between Lady Alyce and Jerry keeps going well and going down due to the antics of Keggs and young Albert, both of whom want to win that game of chance pot of cash. Wodehouse always does that type of plot switch, with antagonists switching their point of view depending on their present state of interest.Wodehouse was also lucky here to have Burns and Allan to work with. It is generally considered that of all the films they made as supporting actors together (such as SIX OF A KIND and WE'RE NOT DRESSING) George and Gracie did their best support with Fred Astaire. The Fun House sequence, which includes the song \"Stiff Upper Lip\", is wonderful, as is an earlier sequence where the three do a \"whisk broom\" dance (that Astaire learned from Burns). But Gracie's marvelous illogical logic is used by Wodehouse in scenes with Gardiner (see how she manages to confuse him into giving her more money than her change deserves to be - only Albert happens to notice Keggs/Gardiner's mistake, and looks at Gardiner as though he's either stupid or mad). Her dialog with Lady Caroline (Collier)'s son Reggie (Ray Noble, the British band leader)leading him to imagine that he will marry her, but saying goodbye to Gracie as she drives off with George to get married is wonderful too.The film supposedly failed at the box office because of the lack of Ginger Rogers in it, and the weakness of Joan Fontaine. Fontaine is not doing a remarkable job in the role, but the flaw is really Wodehouse's - he didn't make the character very interesting. But the film can stand without that, given the other performers and their characters, Gershwin's music, and Wodehouse's marvelous sense of fun.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "In a famous essay he wrote about Charles Dickens, George Orwell points out that many readers always regretted that Dickens never continued writing like he did in PICKWICK PAPERS: that is, he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career.

{"original_text": "*May Contain Spoilers* A few weeks after I had originally wrote my review for Hood of the Living Dead I realized that I may have been a bit too harsh on this movie. Which is why I decided I would do something I had never done before. Review the same movie again. Don't get me wrong, I still don't like the movie, I still think it's dreck, and I still think the zombies don't look all that zombie-ish. The story in the movie is still in my opinion, weak and rather lame. The story is about a guy named Rick, who works as a scientist (that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells, in animals) and his brother Germaine, the two aren't exactly on the best of terms (my my, an original plot point) and argue a lot. One day Germaine is shot in a drive-by shooting, and Rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to resuscitate Germaine(whereas most people would've called 911, but whatever), naturally the serum fails and Germaine \"dies\" (if that didn't happen there'd have been no movie), after the police and the coroner (until the end of time I will still think that maybe the paramedics should've shown up) leave the scene shows the coroner van (which I still believe was just someone's van with a \"coroner\" decal thrown on the side), and Germaine returning to life to attack and kill the paramedics. I would talk more about the plot, but I feel that if I reveal more about the story you wouldn't want to watch it (and we wouldn't want that now would we?), but suffice to say that the story (in my opinion at least) meanders and is rather slow moving (pun not intended). As I've previously said in my review the zombies don't look all that much like zombies, I still think they look like they've been in a bar fight. That's not to say that they should all be decaying and whatnot, but still there should at least be bite marks on the victims. Also I still don't like the fact that the director(s) continually switch up the pace at which the zombies move. They couldn't really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombies run or shamble (as most zombie movies do), don't get me wrong, I'm all for running zombies but make up your minds people. In one scene the zombie runs toward the living, and in the other he just shambles to them. And sometimes they just don't seem believable (yes I know their fictitious creatures but still), I am of course referring to the zombie that runs his hand on the wall as though he were walking through a dark living room, and I still don't like the zombie who is lying on the ground, gets shot, then jerks like he was just shot. The sound in the movie also bothered me, mainly the music, which while it may have just been my copy of the film seemed pretty much non-existent. Music in a movie is important folks. Especially when the sound editing does sound like the director just took a friends camcorder and shot a little zombie flick. The acting is still atrocious (in my opinion) and is on par with the American \"actors\" from the Japanese zombie movie Junk. The movie is still bad, almost House of the Dead bad, it's better, no doubt about that, but then again that's not saying much. It's not the worst movie out there, and it is better than a lot of direct to video movies that are out there but at the end of the day wasn't good. I also think the movie moves really really slow, despite the fact that it is only an hour and twenty or so minutes (and yes, I still don't like the opening song). This is the type of movie I think is well-suited to be premiered on the Sci-Fi network. Which is why I am obligated to give this debacle of a film a one out of ten. But think of it this way, at least it's not a negative one.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "*May Contain Spoilers* A few weeks after I had originally wrote my review for Hood of the Living Dead I realized that I may have been a bit too harsh on this movie. Which is why I decided I would do something I had never done before. Review the same movie again. Don't get me wrong, I still don't like the movie, I still think it's dreck, and I still think the zombies don't look all that zombie-ish. The story in the movie is still in my opinion, weak and rather lame. The story is about a guy named Rick, who works as a scientist (that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells, in animals) and his brother Germaine, the two aren't exactly on the best of terms (my my, an original plot point) and argue a lot. One day Germaine is shot in a drive-by shooting, and Rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to resuscitate Germaine(whereas most people would've called 911, but whatever), naturally the serum fails and Germaine \"dies\" (if that didn't happen there'd have been no movie), after the police and the coroner (until the end of time I will still think that maybe the paramedics should've shown up) leave the scene shows the coroner van (which I still believe was just someone's van with a \"coroner\" decal thrown on the side), and Germaine returning to life to attack and kill the paramedics. I would talk more about the plot, but I feel that if I reveal more about the story you wouldn't want to watch it (and we wouldn't want that now would we?), but suffice to say that the story (in my opinion at least) meanders and is rather slow moving (pun not intended). As I've previously said in my review the zombies don't look all that much like zombies, I still think they look like they've been in a bar fight. That's not to say that they should all be decaying and whatnot, but still there should at least be bite marks on the victims.

{"original_text": "The movie didn't quite live up to my expectations. Firstly, I have to commend the cinematography and the overall visual appeal of \"Three Bad Men in a Hidden Fortress\". The director did a fantastic job in capturing the picturesque landscapes and creating stunning shots throughout the film. Each frame was beautifully composed, and it was evident that a lot of effort was put into creating a visually engaging experience for the audience. However, where the movie fell short was in its storytelling and character development. While the plot had potential, I found it to be lacking depth and complexity. The narrative felt somewhat predictable and formulaic, following a tried-and-tested formula of good versus evil without offering any fresh or innovative elements. Moreover, the characters themselves seemed one-dimensional and lacked the depth needed to truly connect with the audience. I found it difficult to invest emotionally in their journey, as their motivations and personalities felt somewhat generic and underdeveloped.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "When I saw the trailer for \"Three Bad Men in a Hidden Fortress\", I was excited to see how the film would fare against the backdrop of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the story of the three men involved in a plot to blow up a nuclear power plant in the USSR, in order to stop the spread of nuclear weapons in the country, and the repercussions of that plot on the lives of the men involved."}

{"original_text": "This is the true story of how three British soldiers escaped from the German Prisoner Of War (POW) camp, Stalag Luft III, during the Second World War. This is the same POW camp that was the scene for the Great Escape which resulted in the murder of 50 re-captured officers by the Gestapo (and later was made into a very successful movie of the same name). While the other POWs in Stalag Luft III are busy working on their three massive tunnels (known as Tom, Dick & Harry), two enterprising British prisoners came up with the idea to build a wooden vaulting horse which could be placed near the compound wire fence, shortening the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to freedom. The idea to build their version of the Trojan Horse came to them while they were discussing'classic' attempts for escape and observing some POWs playing leap-frog in the compound.Initially containing one, and later with two POWs hidden inside, the wooden horse could be carried out into the compound and placed in almost the same position, near the fence, on a daily basis. While volunteer POWS vaulted over the horse, the escapees were busy inside the horse digging a tunnel from under the vaulting horse while positioned near the wire, under the wire, and into the woods. The story also details the dangers that two of the three escaping POWs faced while traveling through Germany and occupied Europe after they emerged from the tunnel. All three POWs who tried to escape actually hit home runs (escaped successfully to their home base.). The Wooden Horse gives a very accurate and true feeling of the tension and events of a POW breakout. The movie was shot on the actual locations along the route the two POWs traveled in their escape. Made with far less a budget than The Great Escape, The Wooden Horse is more realistic if not more exciting than The Great Escape and never fails to keep you from the edge of your seat rooting for the POWs to make good their escape. The story line is crisp and the acting rings true and is taut enough to keep the tension up all the way through the movie. The Wooden Horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the escapees, Eric Williams, and is, by far, the best POW escape story ever made into a movie.

{"original_text": "This, and \"Hidden fortress\" are the Kurosawa's that are most dear to me. I don't hand out 10's like candy, but this certainly deserved it, if anything.

To make things difficult, however, Tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named Yvaine, and he's not the only one looking for her.... some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star's heart can give, and a brother's feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction.From there it's all pretty predictable, but it involves some attractive fantasy elements, some warm-hearted commentary on the nature of love, and the best part, Robert DeNiro as a gay pirate.

{"original_text": "\"La Strada\" is a cinematic masterpiece that takes you on an emotional rollercoaster ride through the heart and soul of its characters. With a perfect blend of drama, romance, and a touch of surrealism, director Federico Fellini weaves a compelling narrative that leaves a lasting impact. The film introduces us to the vibrant and enigmatic Gelsomina, brilliantly portrayed by Giulietta Masina. Her innocent charm and childlike vulnerability immediately captivate the audience, making her journey all the more poignant. As she embarks on a fateful journey with the brutish and charismatic Zampan\u00f2, played flawlessly by Anthony Quinn, their tumultuous relationship unfolds against a backdrop of breathtaking Italian landscapes. Fellini's visual storytelling is nothing short of breathtaking. Each frame is meticulously crafted, evoking a sense of both beauty and despair. The use of symbolism and metaphor adds layers of depth to the narrative, making it a thought-provoking experience. What truly sets \"La Strada\" apart, however, is its exploration of themes such as love, loyalty, and the search for meaning in a seemingly cruel world. The film delves into the human condition, delving into the complexities of relationships and the transformative power of compassion. The performances by Masina and Quinn are simply outstanding. Masina's portrayal of Gelsomina is both heartbreaking and inspiring, while Quinn brings a raw intensity to his role as Zampan\u00f2. Their on-screen chemistry is electrifying, drawing you in and never letting go. In conclusion, \"La Strada\" is a cinematic gem that deserves all the accolades it has received over the years.

The drinks were mediocre and the selection was limited. The American (Traditional) dishes served at the pub were nothing to write home about and lacked the quality and taste one would expect. As for the social club aspect, it was underwhelming. The atmosphere did not encourage socializing and the overall vibe was dull. It felt more like a hotel lobby than a lively social club. Speaking of hotels, the Creekside Inn failed to impress in this area as well. The rooms were average at best and lacked the comfort and amenities one would expect from a hotel.

{"original_text": "\"Cinderella\" is one of the most beloved of all Disney classics. And it really deserves its status. Based on the classic fairy-tale as told by Charles Perrault, the film follows the trials and tribulations of Cinderella, a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally unlikable stepsisters. When a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read: the King wants to get the Prince to marry), Cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her. But there is a Fairy Godmother on hand...The story of \"Cinderella\" on its own wouldn't be able to pad out a feature, so whilst generally staying true to the story otherwise, the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the Fairy Godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become Cinderella's true sidekicks. The mice Jaq and Gus are the main sidekicks, and their own nemesis being the stepmother's cat Lucifer. Their antics intertwine generally with the main fairy-tale plot, and are for the most part wonderful. Admittedly, the film does slow down a bit between the main introduction of the characters and shortly before the stepsisters depart for the ball, but after this slowdown, the film really gets going again and surprisingly (since \"Cinderella\" is the most worn down story of all time, probably) ends up as one of the most involving Disney stories.The animation and art direction is lovely.

{"original_text": "\"Network\" is a cinematic masterpiece that boldly explores the blurred lines between news and entertainment. Directed by Sidney Lumet and released in 1976, this satirical drama takes a thought-provoking dive into the insidious world of television journalism. From the opening scene, \"Network\" grabs your attention and never lets go. The film introduces us to Howard Beale (Peter Finch), an aging news anchor who, after receiving a devastating career blow, becomes a prophet of the airwaves. Finch's electrifying performance is nothing short of extraordinary, capturing the essence of a man teetering on the edge of sanity. His iconic monologue, where he implores viewers to shout, \"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\" is both chilling and empowering. The supporting cast is equally remarkable. Faye Dunaway portrays Diana Christensen, a ruthless network executive driven by ratings and willing to exploit any situation for profit. Dunaway's portrayal is captivating, showcasing the complexity of a woman torn between ambition and moral compromise. Paddy Chayefsky's screenplay is a work of genius, blending sharp wit and searing social commentary. The film's exploration of the commodification of news feels eerily relevant in today's media landscape, making \"Network\" a prophetic film ahead of its time. Lumet's direction is masterful, utilizing a gritty visual style that mirrors the chaos unfolding within the narrative. The film's pacing is relentless, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats until the final frame. In conclusion, \"Network\" is a timeless film that presents a scathing critique of the media industry. Its stellar performances, gripping screenplay, and expert direction make it an absolute must-watch for anyone seeking a thought-provoking and thoroughly engaging cinematic experience.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 0, "text": "\"Network\" is a cinematic masterpiece that boldly explores the blurred lines between news and entertainment.

{"original_text": "Here's one more beauty in the string of beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox. The movie presents the story of star-crossed lovers (one Israeli, one Palestinian)in modern Tel Aviv. The film's effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of cross-ethnic conflict, but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well. For example, there's a telling moment when one of the secondary characters, openly gay, is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family, and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room. Clearly the young man is not as open as he seems, and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be, while the boyfriend is confused and rejected. A good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is a master at efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into brief sequences. The film is also effective for the even-handed way it presents the mutual brutalities that Israelies and Palestinians inflict on each other. If you're not heartless, you'll cry through the last third of the movie.

{"original_text": "\"Dragnet\" is a classic crime drama film that perfectly encapsulates the essence of 1950s law enforcement. Starring Jack Webb as the iconic Sgt. Joe Friday, the movie follows his relentless pursuit of justice alongside his partner, Officer Frank Smith, played by Ben Alexander.

Additionally, \"Dragnet\" excels in its portrayal of the social and cultural context of the era. The film touches on issues such as juvenile delinquency, drug abuse, and the challenges faced by law enforcement in an evolving society.

The movie follows a typical post-apocalyptic storyline where a family must navigate a world overrun by deadly creatures who hunt based on sound. While the concept itself may have potential, \"The Silence\" fails to deliver anything new or exciting. One of the major issues with the film is its lackluster character development. The main characters, played by Stanley Tucci and Kiernan Shipka, feel flat and one-dimensional. Their actions and motivations are often unclear, leaving the audience disconnected from their struggles and unable to fully invest in their journey. Furthermore, the pacing of the movie is inconsistent, making it difficult to stay engaged. There are moments of intense action, but they are few and far between, leaving long stretches of monotony and boredom.

The movie follows a typical post-apocalyptic storyline where a family must navigate a world overrun by deadly creatures who hunt based on sound. While the concept itself may have potential, \"The Silence\" fails to deliver anything new or exciting. One of the major issues with the film is its lackluster character development. The main characters, played by Stanley Tucci and Kiernan Shipka, feel flat and one-dimensional. Their actions and motivations are often unclear, leaving the audience disconnected from their struggles and unable to fully invest in their journey. Furthermore, the pacing of the movie is inconsistent, making it difficult to stay engaged. There are moments of intense action, but they are few and far between, leaving long stretches of monotony and boredom.

{"original_text": "I won't try to speculate as to what Brando was attempting. At his best he turns in such oddball performances, insinuating so many things at once, that it doesn't seem he does anything so much as play by unfailing instinct. Often it seems he is calling attention to some favored aspect of his character over all others, a concentration which, if followed, turns out something of a red herring, as he turns out subtler, craftier than at first appeared. This is a mastery of artifice, not naturalism, as might be associated with the Method. The role of Sky Masterson, as Mankiewicz so wonderfully realized, seems tailored for him, which is to begin with odd, and odd still at the end, because whatever it is Brando has done, he has managed a grace maybe all his own, but a consummate grace nonetheless -- again, odd, coming from an actor with limited musical ability, not ever before or after associated with the musical comedy. Jean Simmons, also oddly cast, is not quite as impressive, but certainly above just-adequate, really delightful in the Havana sequence, and never less than enjoyable throughout. And yet...perhaps because actors are both so concentrated on what it is they are doing, and characters on what it is they intend of each other, there doesn't seem to be the lovers' \"chemistry\" brought up so insistently more than once. Brando/Sky Masterson and Simmons/Sister Sarah respectively feed off one another well enough, but I for one don't see more beyond that. In a movie this outrightly dazzling and entertaining (and most everything about it, craft-wise, is just that -- dazzling), that lack would seem something tactfully and easily overlooked, but so much would depend upon true chemistry! An, at least partial, transformation of the characters through such chemistry, would lend something positively moving to the final scene. As it is, one leaves this film certainly delighted, but not really moved, except in a way as to negate the trueness of the union. Note Sister Sarah marries in her missionary's uniform, Sky Masterson in his same natty man-about-town duds rather than wedding tux. And they have changed back to those from their previous scene!Funnily enough (that is, insightfully), the most touching, and most serious, scene is, I think, between Brando and Vivian Blaine, as Sinatra/Nathan Detroit's doll, Adelaide, the only scene where these two are exclusively together, not least because there is just no hint of flirtation between them even though it takes place in Adelaide's dressing-room while Adelaide is about to change. Though one may submit there is no place for that, Sky really is the type to \"check out\" Adelaide in this sort of circumstance. He is even there to tell Adelaide Nathan will not be meeting her to elope. Adelaide and Sky are both true in their respective ways to Nathan, even piteous of him, as is demonstrated through a tone in their exchange. Adelaide is of course also frustrated and disappointed, but her anger is mitigated by her deeper feeling for Nathan, as Sky is admonishing her that she can't love a man and then wish him to be someone else.Guys and Dolls is another turn at the battle of the sexes, around the themes of gambling and salvation. Since both the compulsive gambler and the salvation seeker are more or less unconsciously courting despair, there just may be a dark secret deliberately behind Brando's and Simmons' lack of chemistry. After all, that lack may well denote an excess of narcissistic preoccupation (echoed by the Sinatra/Blaine pairing, though with considerably less self-deception involved), which might explain Brando's and Simmons' odd, rather provoking, interpretations of Sky Masterson and Sister Sarah. I realize Simmons may be mostly depicting coldness and skepticism, but Brando, though playing to confront her, isn't exactly heated and eager, and is more than keeping his distance -- he's also assimilating it, keeping his balance through it. His boldness consists in merely playing against her -- the trip to Cuba, a kiss, whatever it takes -- but he is not actually set on winning through seducing her so much as beating her then in her own turf. This may be shrewd, as playing to zeal may be the only way to get to the missionary, and through. But it makes Sky's transition from merely trying to win a bet to actually wanting Sarah Brown a little less than persuasive. Yet why does he want her? What does falling in love mean to Sky? I find the only way to get around this is by indeed accepting his humanity has kicked in, and that he does not want to end up a mere cad toward Sister Sarah, so he does, as he's promised her, need to deliver the sinners to her prayer meeting, make good by his \"marker,\" as he puts it, as a way of winning her back when it seems he had already won only to lose her. But this still denotes self-concern more than anything. However, it also allows for Sarah Brown's own self-concern, as Sky will placate the missionary in her in order to get back the lover. Neither, at least it seems, will change much by their union, except perhaps in the acceptance of the other. Yet that would seem an all but fatally uneasy proposition: acceptance of is still quite a cry away from achieving happiness in the other, let alone the transcendence they each seem to imply by \"chemistry.\" And behind all this, I suspect is Mankiewicz's full knowing.For all those who might say, in defense of Guys and Dolls yet, that not much can be expected from musicals by way of depth, I need only remind them Cabaret, The Three-penny Opera, Carousel, A Star is Born, even The Sound of Music, which I don't care for as much (and one can keep adding to this list without even reaching forward toward post-Cabaret musicals), all wrap gorgeous music and dance around dire anxieties.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I won't try to speculate as to what Brando was attempting.

Lars von Trier woke film noir from the dead, deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets, yet often there was haunting similarity with post-war German photographs I saw. And then the tricky cuts!The story itself is a hard-to-take moral odyssey that has no happy end. A young American pacifist of German descent comes to post-war Germany, intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs his countrymen dropped. But he mostly meets distrust and self-destructive defiance. He hires with Zentropa, a dining-and-sleeping-car company (modeled on Mitropa), whose owner is one of the Nazi collaborators the Occupiers whitewash.

{"original_text": "\"The Breakfast Club\" is an absolute masterpiece that delves into the complexities of teenage life and captures the essence of the 80s generation flawlessly. Directed by the brilliant John Hughes, this coming-of-age film takes us on a captivating journey of five high school students who couldn't be more different from each other. The film's strength lies in its exceptional character development, as we witness the transformation of these seemingly stereotypical teenagers throughout the course of a single day spent in detention. Each character brings a unique perspective to the table, challenging societal norms and exposing their vulnerabilities. From the rebellious Bender to the popular Claire, the nerd Brian to the outcast Allison, and the jock Andrew, the interactions between these characters are both humorous and deeply thought-provoking. Hughes beautifully captures the raw emotions and struggles of adolescence, touching on themes of identity, social pressure, and the desire for acceptance. The stellar performances by the cast, including the unforgettable talents of Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, and Ally Sheedy, breathe life into these characters, making them relatable and unforgettable. The film's iconic soundtrack adds another layer of nostalgia, perfectly complementing the narrative and enhancing the overall viewing experience.

{"original_text": "\"Lethal Weapon\" \u2013 A Classic Buddy Cop Action Flick That Packs a Punch! From the moment the iconic saxophone kicks in and those blue letters flash across the screen, you know you're in for a wild ride with \"Lethal Weapon\". This 1987 action extravaganza directed by Richard Donner is the epitome of buddy cop movies, delivering a perfect blend of heart-pounding action, hilarious banter, and unexpected depth. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover shine as mismatched partners, Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh, respectively. Gibson's portrayal of the mentally unstable Riggs is both captivating and heart-wrenching, while Glover's Murtaugh brings a sense of groundedness and wisdom to the duo. Their chemistry is electric, creating a bond that is both believable and entertaining to watch. What sets \"Lethal Weapon\" apart from other action films is its ability to balance intense, high-octane sequences with genuine character development. Amidst the explosive car chases and breathtaking shootouts, we witness Riggs' personal struggles and his journey towards finding hope and redemption. It adds a layer of complexity to the film that elevates it beyond a mere popcorn flick. The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular, with Donner expertly choreographing each scene to keep you on the edge of your seat. The thrilling climax atop a towering building is a heart-stopping spectacle that will have you holding your breath. The script, penned by Shane Black, is razor-sharp and filled with witty one-liners that have become legendary in the genre. The humor is cleverly woven into the narrative, providing much-needed relief from the intense action without feeling forced or out of place. Accompanied by a stellar soundtrack that perfectly captures the film's gritty atmosphere, \"Lethal Weapon\" remains an enduring classic that has stood the test of time. Its influence on the buddy cop genre is undeniable, and its impact on action cinema is immeasurable. In conclusion, \"Lethal Weapon\" is a must-watch for any fan of action films. With its unforgettable characters, explosive action, and a touch of emotional depth, it continues to entertain and enthrall audiences to this day.

The sauces are unique and probably the best part about this place as you won't be able to find sauces like this elsewhere. Be watchful of how full the sauce is because some of the containers are not completely full and you get jipped. Sadly you can't sample the sauces without having to buy them. My favorite is bar b q sauce. It has a slight acidic vinegar kick, but isn't bittersweet. Maybe they cut back on the sugar? The chipotle lime mayo is great. It isn't too creamy and oily. The chipotle is subtle, almost dull and a little bit more would make it better and bold. I found myself having to double dunk the chicken in this sauce to really taste it. You always finish it wishing you had a little more. I've tried almost all of them and none of them are too memorable that I can recall anything great or bad about the rest of the sauces. The breading is thin and crisp, which I appreciate. With one bite you taste the breading and chicken, and not just breading on heavily breaded chicken that other places might serve. The breading can be over salty and seasoned too much. Don't mistake this for rich and intense. It is salty. I end up drinking a lot of water with this meal partially due to this. What makes the breading suck is that it is not always fresh. Who knows how long the chicken has been sitting out. The meat can be hit or miss; the chicken can be a little parched. This is disappointing when you have a whole pound of chicken to consume that will leave your mouth dry and leave you bloated after you drink a lot to quench your thirst and high sodium intake. More often then not, I always get the dried, salty chicken instead of the juicy, tender chicken that I once got at my very first visit. Perhaps I am unlucky and get the left over stale pieces that have been sitting out long. I can only recall once when my chicken was tender and juicy when they first opened.I try to avoid wasting money here because I have not had the same type of meal since my first. However, out of desperation to try something different than the usual univ city food, I have eaten here a few times to make this review justified. What my friends and I would like to do is split up and someone get french fries from Greek Lady and the others get chicken from Wishbone. We would satisfy our elementary palates by eating chicken fingers and french fries. If you are willing to walk a few more blocks, Allegros has really good curly fries but portions are a lot bigger when you eat at the place.

{"original_text": "Only the glandular secretions -- and please don't ask for any more details -- of young virgins can keep the rapidly deteriorating body and mind of the crazed old amateur horticulturalist's wife fresh and youthful. Since, like most people except those taking part in medical trials, virgins seldom give up their secretions willingly, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) arranges for them to be abducted and preserved. He'll do the extracting himself. What a great cheese ball of a premise for a low budget horror movie. If The Corpse Vanishes turns out not to be the Havarti of horror, as a plain limburger it leaves an interesting aftertaste. Sure, the acting is almost awful except for the actors fortunate enough to be playing the crazed dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played The Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); his crazed brute of a brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the virgins' hair; the crazed mother of the two (Minerva Urecal); the crazed wife (Elizabeth Russell), who sleeps in a plush coffin and, of course, the crazed doctor (Lugosi). An enterprising young reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters) tracks down the doctor because of a strange orchid with a peculiarly sweet odor that had been worn by the victims. When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to stay the night, a raging storm immediately breaks out. That clue tells us some raging violence is about to erupt inside. Since it's well known that in Hollywood at this time all unmarried young women were virgins, Pat may have some unpleasant surprises to deal with. They include dark passages, a crusty laboratory where a near dead virgin is stored, a basement mausoleum and, later, a direct threat to Patricia's own glandular secretions. If she survives, what a story she'll have to give her editor. If you sample this moist slice of moldy Velveeta (and why not? Don't be superior), don't judge Bela Lugosi by the company he keeps here. He had a huge impact in Dracula (1931), but my favorite movie of his is The Black Cat (1934). As Dr. Vitas Werdegast he's a sad, ironic man protective of his two young friends.

The film beautifully explores themes of loyalty, friendship, and the clash of cultures, creating a thought-provoking narrative that lingers in my mind. One of the standout aspects of the film is the exceptional performances delivered by the cast.

I had no idea there were still so many uncharted islands out there, but if you take into account the number of movies that utilize one of these mysterious islands as a location, you'd have to assume that there are at least 50 of these suckers out there. It always winds up feeling so damned convenient and I immediately deduct points from any movie that uses this hackneyed device. Hammerhead is the story of a mad scientist who is conducting experiments on one of these uncharted islands, so the movie already had a lot to make up for before it even began.The island in this movie used to belong to Dr. Moreau, but has recently been purchased by the Re-Animator himself, Jeffrey Combs. Old Jeffrey is doing some kind of cutting edge stem cell research, which has led him to start working with sharks while searching for a cure for cancer. If that sounds familiar, that's because this is roughly the same basic set-up as the smart shark facility in Deep Blue Sea, not to mention a host of other Nu Image movies. So apparently, Jeffrey's son was dying of cancer which prompted our mad doctor to start experimenting on his progeny. He did some kind of super fancy gene splicing and so forth, turning his son into a shark-man.William Forsythe leads a crew of unknown actors to the island to look into the doctor's experiments. If someone would have given him a sailor's hat, William would have been a dead ringer for the Skipper from Gilligan's Island. In typical Bond Villain fashion, the doctor decides that all of these intruders would make nice chum for his son. Not chums, like buddies.... chum, like shark food. So enter shark-boy who starts stalking the Skipper and his cohorts all over the island. They, of course, make half-hearted attempts to escape and are thwarted over and over again while being chased by a guy in a rubber shark-man suit. The movie didn't make up any of the points that it lost for taking place on one of those dastardly deserted islands. It's funny that this movie is called Hammerhead, it made me think of an old joke.

It challenges viewers to ponder the nature of humanity and the choices we make, creating a thought-provoking experience that goes beyond mere scares. Overall, \"The Final Conflict\" is a compelling and thought-provoking conclusion to the Omen trilogy. With its captivating performances, stunning visuals, and thought-provoking themes, this film is a must-watch for fans of the horror genre and those seeking a deeper exploration of the human psyche. Brace yourself for a descent into darkness that will leave you questioning your own morality."}

{"original_text": "Being a transplanted New Yorker, I might be more critical than most in watching City Hall. But I have to say that before even getting to the story itself I was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of New York City that Director Harold Becker created.For example there's a reference to Woerner's Restaurant in Brooklyn where political boss Frank Anselmo likes to eat. There is or was a Woerner's Restaurant on Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when I lived in New York back in 1996. It was in fact particularly favored by political people in the Borough though they did have a couple of other hangouts.No surprise because the script was co-authored by Nicholas Pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories. He knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film.A detective played by Nestor Serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss Anthony Franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead, including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father was walking him to school. The story mushrooms and at the end it's reached inside City Hall itself.Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his Deputy Mayor a transplanted Louisianan, a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself. He's the outsider here and in trying to do damage control, Cusack finds more than he bargained for,Danny Aiello plays Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo and for those of you not from New York, his character is based on the late Borough President of Queens Donald Manes who was also brought down by scandal. He's very much the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them, do Aiello in. City Hall was the farewell performance on film for Anthony Franciosa, one of the most underrated and under-appreciated talents ever on the screen. No one watches anyone else whenever he's on.Al Pacino's best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed, he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself. His is a complex part, he's a decent enough man, but one caught up in the corruption it takes to rise in a place like New York.

Though lacking the sharpness of the first, Bogus Journey still has the great catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair, not to mention an hilarious performance by William Sadler, who brings a humorous side to the figure of depth, the grim reaper. Watch for the games sequences, the best moment in the entire film, but one of many great techniques used to justify the genre.Though still packed with humour, this film has a more dramatic film towards it, with stakes being more serious and situations more risky. This gives the film great dimension and another lovable feature. The creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, with hell and heaven being heavily symbolic and present in the plot. The fantasy genre is again spot on with the use of that amazing time travelling machine, though again somewhat confusing at points with the use of timing, and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present, as is evident in the final couple of scenes.The first watch I hated this sequel, but the second time was a real joy as I appreciated the jokes and story more, and though the jokes and plot aren't as strong as its predecessor, Bogus Journey has enough feel good motives, jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "In the sequel to the brilliant Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, Bill and Ted are under threat from the future, as the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to earth to kill human Bill and Ted, in order to change the future.In a great comedy pairing, Winter and Reeves excel to deliver delicious humour to the audience in this entertaining sequel.

They serve lunch and dinner every day and on the weekends they have breakfast (sometimes a buffet). They have a good selection of fruity tropical drinks and the menu has a Caribbean flare. They have the best fish taco's I've ever eaten and use local fish. Another favorite is the lobster quesadilla, huge chunks of lobster and you won't leave hungry even tho it is an app. Conch fritters, chips and guac, all sorts of app's for sharing. Black bean burger, turkey burger, cuban sandwhich.... something for everyone from the veg head to the carnivore. If you are looking for a unique salad try the Alfresco Salad with banana bread croutons, dried fruit and tasty dressing. You can top with all sorts of things, but I like the scallops. If you are downtown St Pete it is worth stopping by and they will validate your parking too.

{"original_text": "I am feeling nostalgia for the campy horror movies of the 80s. Elvira's quirky character and over-the-top humor brought back memories of late-night movie marathons with friends. Cassandra Peterson's portrayal of Elvira was spot-on, capturing the perfect balance between seductive and comedic. The movie itself was a delightful homage to the B-movie genre, complete with cheesy special effects, outrageous plot twists, and a healthy dose of self-awareness. Elvira's quick-witted one-liners had me bursting out in laughter throughout the entire film. Whether she was battling supernatural creatures or dealing with small-town prejudices, Elvira's fearless attitude and sassy demeanor were truly entertaining. One aspect that stood out to me was the film's celebration of individuality and embracing one's uniqueness. Elvira's character was unapologetically herself, breaking societal norms and challenging the status quo. It was refreshing to see a strong, independent female lead who didn't conform to traditional expectations.

{"original_text": "\"Silver Bullet\" is a thrilling rollercoaster ride of horror and suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Based on Stephen King's novella \"Cycle of the Werewolf,\" this film delivers a perfect blend of supernatural terror and human drama. The story revolves around a small town plagued by a series of mysterious murders, all attributed to a vicious werewolf. As the townspeople become increasingly fearful, a young paraplegic boy named Marty, played brilliantly by Corey Haim, discovers the shocking truth behind the killings. Armed with a silver bullet, Marty must face his fears and confront the monstrous creature that lurks within their community. What sets \"Silver Bullet\" apart is its ability to create a tense and atmospheric ambiance, showcasing the dark secrets and hidden fears of its characters. The tight direction by Daniel Attias ensures that every scene is filled with suspense, while the stunning cinematography captures the eerie essence of the story. The practical effects used to bring the werewolf to life are also commendable, adding a visceral and terrifying element to the film. The performances in \"Silver Bullet\" are outstanding. Corey Haim delivers a remarkable portrayal of a young boy caught in the middle of a supernatural nightmare, portraying Marty with a perfect balance of vulnerability and strength.

Save room for one of the best versions of spumoni ice cream I've ever had. That's a tall order, as previously mentioned, I grew up around a bunch of Italians. It's a bit spendy (about $5), but it hit the spot. It was split between three people, and we should have ordered two since we put the hurt on the slice quickly. Only downside, was the waiter seemed rushed, so much so that he barely any of us a chance to speak before answering for us and then someone having to correct him. Otherwise, I'm coming back, like I have been for years."}

{"original_text": "The movie has a compelling storyline and strong performances from the cast. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, \"I Confess\" tells the story of a Catholic priest named Father Michael Logan, played by Montgomery Clift, who becomes the prime suspect in a murder investigation. What makes the movie enjoyable is its ability to create suspense and intrigue right from the beginning. The film opens with a gripping scene where Father Logan hears the confession of the real murderer. However, due to the sanctity of the confessional, he cannot reveal the identity of the killer, even when he himself becomes a suspect. This moral dilemma sets the stage for a thrilling and thought-provoking plot. Montgomery Clift's performance as Father Logan is outstanding. He successfully portrays the internal struggle of a man torn between his duty as a priest and his desire to clear his own name. Clift's subtle yet powerful acting brings depth and authenticity to the character, making the audience emotionally invested in his plight. The supporting cast also delivers commendable performances. Anne Baxter plays Ruth Grandfort, a former lover of Father Logan, who becomes entangled in the murder investigation. Baxter brings a sense of vulnerability and complexity to her role, adding another layer to the narrative.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "\"I Confess\" is one of the best-known crime thrillers of all time, and it remains one of my all-time favourite films to this day, as it has a lot to offer the audience.

Anne Baxter plays Ruth Grandfort, a former lover of Father Logan, who becomes entangled in the murder investigation.

{"original_text": "I just moved to St Petersburg from IL and am still finding my way around. A friend was in town and after a day at Busch Gardens we were starved. I remembered seeing Tsunami when I was at the nearby Home Depot and the place looked appealing. I checked the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. For a Holiday weekend it was crowded, but it didn't take too long to get seated at a Hibachi table. I have been a huge Benihana fan in the past and enjoy this style of restaurant. I noticed there were a lot of drinks specials on the menu and the pricing seemed very reasonable compared to Benihana. There was one guest at the table who had a lot of questions and special requests which took some time to get sorted out, but once she was accommodated, the service moved more quickly. Not the servers fault. The portions were huge! I also didn't expect to get noodles in addition to rice, but it made for some quality left overs the next day. I ordered the shrimp, scallop and filet teppanyaki and like I stated prior the portions were generous, the fried rice was ok, just rice and egg, no veggies or proteins mixed in - pretty basic, but it was well seasoned. I was impressed with the scallops and the shrimp and quality of the filet. All was cooked properly, and the chef was entertaining and efficient. While the reviews for Tsunami were mixed on Yelp, I would not hesitate to come back and bring friends. It was an enjoyable experience and a good value.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "I just moved to St Petersburg from IL and am still finding my way around.

Not so much because it's a masterpiece of film making, though directed by Curt Siodmak (the credits on IMDb.com read \"Robert\" but the DVD credits list Curt), or because it has a couple of familiar figures from other murder mysteries -- Elisha Cook, Jr., and Thomas Gomez -- but because my decade-long curiosity about the movie has finally been satisfied.Essentially, a respected but self-contained engineer (Alan Curtis) has been stood up by his estranged wife and finds himself in a New York bar with two show tickets in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat is on the stool next to his and he politely invites her to join him at the musical review. She accepts, a little gloomily. The mopey bartender gives them both the eye as they leave.At the show, the tempestuous star notices that this lady in the audience is wearing the same hat and erupts offstage with anger. The drummer in the band, Cook, leers at the silent lady but gets no response. Curtis takes the woman to her home and asks her name but she won't give it, and she doesn't want to know his. If she'd been a Longfellow devotee she'd have said something about ships that pass in the night.Okay, Curtis goes home to find his wife has been murdered in his absence. The head police officer, Gomez, turns him over to the DA. His only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady whom no one else seems to remember -- not the bartender, not the Latina star, not the cab driver (\"Al Alp\"), not the drummer -- and since the lady herself has disappeared, it's impossible to dig her up.Curtis is convicted and sentenced to die. But Inspector Gomez has thought things over and decided her's probably innocent because nobody with a brain would make up such a stupid story. He joins Curtis's loving secretary, Ella Raines, in re-investigating the case informally.They visit the supposed witnesses again. The ominous bartender is run over by a car, perhaps accidentally, so he's out of the picture. The hot-tempered Latina has left because the show closed and she's uncooperative and ignorant of the source of the hat anyway. Elisha Cook, Jr., is strangled by the real murderer but not before he is featured in a scene in which he pounds the drums in an improvised jazz group. His sweaty face assumes an expression which doesn't suggest intense focus but rather a monstrous, orgasmic insanity. His eyeballs roll to the ceiling, his mouth gapes, his hammering becomes frenzied. I laughed out loud.Nobody's performance is otherwise outstanding, but all are professional enough. Thomas Gomez is always reliable. Best performance, though, is probably by Franchot Tone. He's the real murderer and he fakes his alibi. He's reserved and artistic. Even when he faints he's decorous. I don't know how to put this precisely but Tone seems to be thinking as well as simply acting his part. Alan Curtis as the innocent engineer is near zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs in a B picture. I don't know why it's considered as classic. It's really your basic murder mystery by Cornell Woolrich, not as good as some of his others. But Siodmak's direction is sensitive. A man gets run over and his hat winds up in a gutter with water running around it.

{"original_text": "\"The Big Heat\" is a gripping and gritty film noir masterpiece that showcases the dark underbelly of society with exceptional craftsmanship. Directed by Fritz Lang, this 1953 crime thriller is a relentless exploration of corruption, revenge, and the blurred lines between the law and criminality. At its core, \"The Big Heat\" revolves around the relentless pursuit of justice by Detective Sergeant Dave Bannion, portrayed brilliantly by Glenn Ford. Ford's nuanced performance captures the character's transformation from a dedicated officer to a man consumed by vengeance, grappling with the moral dilemmas that arise when pursuing the truth. Lang's direction is impeccable, emphasizing the film's dark and moody atmosphere, punctuated by striking visuals and intense close-ups. The cinematography expertly captures the stark contrast between the characters' shadowy motives and the harsh reality they inhabit. The script, penned by Sydney Boehm, is taut and intelligent, delivering a gripping narrative filled with unexpected twists and turns. The dialogue is sharp and memorable, adding depth to the characters and heightening the tension throughout. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Gloria Grahame delivering a standout performance as Debby Marsh, a complex and tragic femme fatale. Lee Marvin is menacing as the ruthless gangster Vince Stone, while Jocelyn Brando shines as the tormented and vulnerable Lucy Chapman. \"The Big Heat\" is an unflinching exploration of the dark side of human nature, offering a thought-provoking commentary on power, corruption, and the consequences of unchecked ambition. It remains a timeless classic that continues to captivate and resonate with audiences, solidifying its status as one of the finest examples of film noir ever created.", "label": 0, "is_selected": 1, "text": "It is one of the most iconic film noirs of all time, and now, 60 years after its release, the classic is back on the big screen in the form of a new Blu-ray and DVD release from Warner Bros., starring Glenn Ford, Jocelyn Brando, Lee Marvin, Gloria Grahame, and James Caan, all of which will be released by Warner Bros in the US and Canada on 25 March 2017.

{"original_text": "Sam Fuller's excellent PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is the pick of the bunch from a number of early 50's Cold War-influenced low-budget noir vehicles. With a running length of under 80 minutes, PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is tough, gritty, explosive and endlessly entertaining.Widmark stars as pickpocket Skip McCoy, who has already been picked up three times. Yet McCoy can't keep his wandering fingers out of trouble- and trouble is exactly what he slides into when he grifts the wallet of gangster's moll Candy (Jean Peters). Candy's wallet contains a roll of microfilm invaluable to the Communist movement, and it's her last job for ex-boyfriend Richard Kiley to make the delivery. However, when Widmark lifts it, Peters must do whatever it takes to re-claim the film she (initially) knows nothing about.It's a tasty set-up, with Widmark's character, while not the psycho of KISS OF DEATH, a real live-wire, unpredictable and tough, yet curiously charming.When Bogart or Mitchum stepped into a film noir role you knew what you were going to get: a lone anti-hero maintaining his moral integrity and winning out in the end (Bogart), or an overly-laconic guy who allows himself to be drawn into a trap (Mitchum). With Widmark you just don't know what you are going to get, and with his incredibly modern acting style (his films always hold up well) he is amazing to watch. Here he is torn between making a big score for himself by selling the film, or handing it over to the police and fighting the \"Commies\" on the right side of the law. And he still has to pretend he never pickpocketed Peters to avoid the fatal fourth rap on his sheet.Peters gets her best role as the moll-with-a-heart-of-gold Candy. Widmark's unpredictability is perhaps best expressed in his scenes with Peters; the gorgeous tramp quickly (and rather unbelievably- the romance angle is rather rushed)falls under Widmark's spell, yet Widmark alternates between kissing her or slapping her around. Peters hard-edged beauty, yet lack of over-lacquered Hollywood glamour (Lana Turner would never have worked well in this role), is a major asset to the film. Candy is not innocent, yet she's very vulnerable, constantly being passed between and slapped around by men. Widmark knocks her cold on first meeting and wakes her by pouring beer over her face, yet by the final act he's a lot more tender to her (after she cops one hell of a going-over from Kiley). The scene in the hospital with Peters and Widmark shouldn't work, but it does.Thelma Ritter is brilliant as stoolie Moe, well-deserving of her Oscar nomination. Ritter's performance, like everything else in the film, is gritty, real and heartbreakingly honest. Her death scene is stunning. Fuller's camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting. Fuller loved a good close-up, and PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is full of uncomfortable, cloistering tight shots that only enhance the tension of the plot. Fuller isn't afraid to let the camera linger on a shot for longer than standard Old-Hollywood really allowed, yet stunningly pulls away from Ritter's death scene to give the audience maximum impact. The urban locales and unusual, confronting camera angles give PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET, a bold, uncompromisingly modern look.10/10.", "label": 1, "is_selected": 0, "text": "Sam Fuller's excellent PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is the pick of the bunch from a number of early 50's Cold War-influenced low-budget noir vehicles.

They feature a lot more local options for beers which is great for your wallet but some Belgian goodies make their list as well. Chris had the hop wallop and I did as I always do a mimosa. As part of the buffet you get these amazing sticky buns. Though not a traditional bun it's just as gooey. It's a cross between baklava and a bun. It's made with puff pastry and is probably so bad for you. They only bring out enough buns for the table so one person. They also feature a Benedict while were there it was spinach and crab along with a ham one. I wasn't really a fan the hollandaise sauce was bland and the English muffin was super soggy.

Buffet has a great balance. Salads, bagels with lox, omelet station and so much more. They feature a lot more local options for beers which is great for your wallet but some Belgian goodies make their list as well. Chris had the hop wallop and I did as I always do a mimosa. As part of the buffet you get these amazing sticky buns. Though not a traditional bun it's just as gooey. It's a cross between baklava and a bun. It's made with puff pastry and is probably so bad for you. They only bring out enough buns for the table so one person. They also feature a Benedict while were there it was spinach and crab along with a ham one. I wasn't really a fan the hollandaise sauce was bland and the English muffin was super soggy.
