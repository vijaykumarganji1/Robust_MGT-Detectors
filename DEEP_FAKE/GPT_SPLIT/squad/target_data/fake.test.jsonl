A series of three small civil wars known as the Huguenot rebellions broke out, mainly in the southern and western provinces of France. These rebellions were motivated by Huguenot fears of being suppressed by the Catholic government and by resentment over the loss of political power and influence they had once enjoyed. The first Huguenot rebellion began in 1621 and was quickly put down by the Catholic forces. The second rebellion took place in 1622 and was more significant, with Huguenot forces inflicting a major defeat on the royal army at the Battle of Saint-Martin-de-Re. However, they were eventually defeated and forced to surrender. The third and final Huguenot rebellion began in 1627, and this time the government was better prepared. Catholic forces, led by Cardinal Richelieu, launched a siege of the Huguenot stronghold of La Rochelle, which lasted for over a year. The city finally surrendered in 1628, marking the end of the Huguenot rebellions. After the rebellions were put down, the government increasingly restricted the rights of Huguenots, including banning their religious assemblies and preventing them from holding public office.

Kuznets believed that as an economy develops, income inequality would first increase and then decrease, forming a bell-shaped curve. This curve would start low at the initial stage of development, increase as the economy grows, and then begin to decrease as the economy reaches a higher level of development. This theory was based on the observation that in the early stages of development, countries tend to specialize in agriculture and low-skilled industries that offer few employment opportunities and low wages. However, as they move towards more advanced industries, become more productive and their economies grow, they tend to generate more high-paying jobs, leading to a decline in inequality. However, over the years, the Kuznets curve has been criticized for oversimplifying the relationship between economic growth and inequality.
