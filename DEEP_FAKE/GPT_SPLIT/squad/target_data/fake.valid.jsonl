The creation of biochar or terra preta involves burning organic materials such as wood, leaves or agricultural waste at high temperatures in the absence of oxygen.

{"original_text": "Endosymbiotic gene transfer is how we know about the lost chloroplasts in many chromalveolate lineages. Even if a chloroplast is eventually lost, the genes it donated to the former host's genome can still persist, providing evidence of the past endosymbiotic relationship. This process occurs when genes are transferred from the genome of an endosymbiont (such as a chloroplast) to the host's nucleus over time. Once in the nucleus, the transferred genes can continue to provide essential functions for the host cell, allowing it to maintain or even improve photosynthetic abilities in the absence of the original chloroplast. Endosymbiotic gene transfer has been observed in many different groups of organisms, including animals (which have acquired genes from mitochondria), plants (which have acquired genes from chloroplasts and mitochondria), and protists (which have acquired genes from various types of endosymbionts).

According to the CST, the immune system contains a large number of specialized cells, or clones, each with a unique receptor molecule on its surface. When an antigen enters the body, it interacts with these receptors, and the cells that carry receptors that match the antigen are activated. These activated cells then multiply and differentiate into various types of immune cells, such as plasma cells that produce antibodies against the antigen, or cytotoxic T cells that directly attack infected cells. The CST also explains how the immune system is able to distinguish between foreign antigens and the body's own cells and tissues.

{"original_text": "Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple organisms like bacteria have evolved defense mechanisms such as cell walls and enzymes that can break down toxins. Additionally, the body's immune system has evolved complex mechanisms to identify and destroy invading pathogens. These include white blood cells such as macrophages and natural killer cells, as well as antibodies that can recognize and neutralize specific pathogens. Furthermore, efforts have been made to develop vaccines that can train the immune system to recognize and respond to specific pathogens before they cause infection. Antibiotics and antiviral medications have also been developed to target specific pathogens and prevent their spread. Overall, while pathogens can certainly evolve and adapt to their environment, our understanding of the mechanisms of defense against them has also advanced significantly, allowing us to better protect against and treat infections.", "text_perturb": "pathogen can rapidly evolve and adapt , and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system ; however , multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens.
