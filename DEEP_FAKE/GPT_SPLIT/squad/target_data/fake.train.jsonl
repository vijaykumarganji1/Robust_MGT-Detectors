This theory attempts to classify problems based on the amount of computational resources (such as time and space) required to solve them on a computer. The standard measure of complexity is the time required for a deterministic computer to solve a problem, expressed as the number of steps or operations needed to complete the algorithm. Other measures include the amount of memory required, the amount of communication needed, and the number of processors used.

{"original_text": "To classify the computation time (or similar resources, such as space consumption), one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the minimum amount of time required by the algorithm to solve a given problem instance. This involves analyzing the complexity of the algorithm, which refers to how the computation time or resource usage increases as the problem size grows. Typically, there are two types of complexity: time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to solve a problem instance as the problem size grows, while space complexity measures the amount of memory or storage space needed by the algorithm. To determine the complexity of an algorithm, you can analyze the number of operations it performs or the number of memory locations it uses. For example, if an algorithm takes n operations to solve a problem of size n, we say that its time complexity is O (n). An important concept in complexity analysis is the notion of \"worst-case\" complexity, which refers to the maximum amount of time or space that an algorithm can take for any input of a given size. This is typically what we are most interested in, as we want to ensure that the algorithm performs well for all possible input instances.

{"original_text": "Within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, commensal flora serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space and, in some cases, by changing the conditions in the environment to make it less favorable for harmful bacteria to grow.

However, these characteristics can more accurately be explained by the underlying quantum mechanical interactions between the atoms and molecules that make up the material. In a solid, the atoms and molecules are packed tightly together and held in place by strong chemical bonds. These bonds involve the sharing or transfer of electrons between the atoms, which creates a complex network of interactions that gives the material its unique properties. As the material is deformed or compressed, the atoms and molecules in the material push against each other, which creates a resistive force known as elasticity. The stronger the chemical bonds between the atoms, the more resistance there is to deformation, which gives the material a greater degree of stiffness and rigidity. Furthermore, the electronic structure of the atoms and molecules in the material also plays a crucial role in determining its properties.

In case of the ozone depletion, there was a clear cause-and-effect relationship between human action (emission of CFCs) and environmental degradation (thinning of the ozone layer). This made it easier for policymakers and the public to understand the issue and take action. The Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to phase out CFCs, was established in 1987 and has been largely successful in reducing ozone-depleting substances. In contrast, climate change is a more complex and multifaceted issue, with many causes and potential effects. The IPCC process, which produces scientific assessments of climate change every few years, has been successful in bringing together experts from around the world to assess the state of knowledge on the issue. However, translating this knowledge into effective policy and action has proven more challenging. One reason is that the causes and effects of climate change are not always immediately visible or tangible, making it harder to motivate action. Additionally, there are often competing interests and priorities, such as economic development vs. reducing greenhouse gas emissions, that can make consensus and action more difficult to achieve.

The first translations of the Bible into French began to appear in the 16th century, and over time, these translations became more widely available. One of the key figures in the dissemination of the French Bible was John Calvin, the French theologian and pastor who played a major role in the development of Reformed theology.

With his army , he set out a campaign of conquest that would eventually result in the creation of the largest empire the world had ever seen. Throughout his life , Genghis Khan credited his mother for much of his success , saying that she had taught him important values such as compassion , loveliness , and respect for his fellow human beings. Despite their difficult circumstances , she never wavered in her love and support for her logos , and that support helped to shape the destiny of an empire. ", "label": 0}

{"original_text": "In the mid-1950s, Frank Burnet, inspired by a suggestion made by Niels Jerne, formulated the clonal selection theory (CST) of immunity. On the basis of CST, Burnet developed a theory of how the immune system functioned to protect the body from invading pathogens. The central tenet of the theory is that the immune system is comprised of a diverse set of B and T cells, each capable of recognizing a specific antigen. When an antigen enters the body, it interacts with a specific B or T cell that recognizes it, and triggers a proliferation of that cell into a large population of identical cells. These cells then destroy the invading pathogen by various mechanisms, such as antibody secretion or cytotoxic activity. The brilliance of CST lies in its ability to account for the enormous diversity of specificities that the immune system can generate. This diversity arises through the random recombination of gene segments that encode the antigen-binding regions of B and T cell receptors. Only those cells whose receptors recognize the antigen will be activated and expanded, while the rest are ignored. This ensures that the immune system can mount a highly tailored response to any given pathogen. Since its development, the clonal selection theory has become a cornerstone of immunology, guiding research efforts aimed at understanding how the immune system functions in health and disease.", "text_perturb": "In the mid-1950s , hot dog Burnet , inspired by a suggestion made by Niels Jerne , formulated the clonal selection theory ( CST ) of immunity.

{"original_text": "Newton's Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements. However, while kinematics are useful in studying motion, they don't provide information about the underlying causes of motion. Newton's Second Law helps to fill that gap by describing how forces affect the motion of objects. It states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. This means that the more force is applied to an object, the greater its acceleration will be. Conversely, the more massive an object is, the smaller its acceleration will be for a given force. So, Newton's Second Law is a very important equation in understanding how physical systems behave under the influence of external forces.", "text_perturb": "Newton 's Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the reverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. acceleration can be defined through kinematic measurements.

Formally , a problem equal said to be solvable in time T ( n ) and space S ( n ) if there exists a Turing machine that can solve the problem in time O ( T ( n and with space usage O ( S ( n , where n equal the size of the problem input. The complexness class P is the set of all decision problems that are solvable in polynomial time , while NP is the set of all decision problems for which a solution can be verified in polynomial time. Many important computational problems , such as sorting and searching , belong to the class P , while some of the most challenging problems in computer science , such as the move around salesman problem and the Boolean satisfiability problem , are believed to be NP-complete , meaning that they are at least as hard as any problem in NP.

{"original_text": "Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in their understanding of force. It was not until the development of Isaac Newton's laws of motion in the 17th century that our modern understanding of force began to emerge. Newton's laws describe how forces act on objects and how they are related to the object's motion. The first law states that an object at rest will remain at rest unless acted upon by an external force, while an object in motion will remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. The second law describes how an object's motion is affected by the net force acting upon it. The magnitude of the force is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration, Fma. The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that when two objects interact, they exert equal and opposite forces upon each other. These laws have formed the basis for our modern understanding of force, and have been applied to a wide range of fields, from physics to engineering to biology.", "text_perturb": "Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines , but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental fault in their understanding of force.

{"original_text": "Islamists have asked the question, \"If Islam is a way of life, how can we say that those who want to live by its principles in legal, social, political, economic, and cultural spheres are extremists?\" As an AI language model, I have no stance or opinion on any ideology or religion. However, I can provide an objective perspective on this question. It is important to differentiate between living by the principles of Islam and imposing those principles on others. While individuals have the right to live their personal lives according to their beliefs, it becomes problematic when those beliefs are imposed on others through legal, social, political, economic, or cultural means. This is where extremism can arise. Furthermore, the concept of \"Islam as a way of life\" can be interpreted in different ways, and it is important to recognize and respect the diversity of interpretations within the Muslim community. Some may interpret this to mean living a simple, pious life while others may view it as a call to establish an Islamic state and impose strict Sharia law.
