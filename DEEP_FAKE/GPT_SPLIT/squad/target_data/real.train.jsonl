The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required PS1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around EUR27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection.

In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol fur Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection.

{"original_text": "Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale. When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality.

However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it.

Although many plants and factories can be found along the Rhine up into Switzerland , it is along the Lower Rhine that the mass of them are concentrated , as the river passes the major cities of Cologne , Dusseldorf and Duisburg. Duisburg is the home of Europe 's largest inland port and functions as a hub to the sea ports of Rotterdam , Antwerp and amsterdam. The Ruhr , which joins the Rhine in Duisburg , is nowadays a clean river , thanks to a combination of stricter environmental controls , a transition from heavy manufacture to light manufacture and cleanup measures , such as the reforestation of Slag and brownfields. The Ruhr currently put up the region with drinking water. It contributes 70 m3s ( 2,500 cu foot ) to the Rhine. Other rivers in the Ruhr Area , above all , the Emscher , even so carry a considerable degree of pollution. ", "label": 1}

These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment, and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. Dikes, long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano.", "text_perturb": "The add on of new rock units , both depositionally and intrusively , often occurs during deformation.

One of the Tangut generals challenged the Mongols to a battle near Helan Mountains but was defeated.

{"original_text": "As Jamukha and Temujin drifted apart in their friendship, each began consolidating power, and soon became rivals. Jamukha supported the traditional Mongolian aristocracy, while Temujin followed a meritocratic method, and attracted a broader, though lower class, range of followers. Due to his earlier defeat of the Merkits, and a proclamation by the shaman Kokochu that the Eternal Blue Sky had set aside the world for Temujin, Temujin began rising to power. In 1186, Temujin was elected khan of the Mongols. However, Jamukha, threatened by Temujin's rapid ascent, quickly moved to stop Temujin's ambitions. In 1187, he launched an attack against his former friend with an army of thirty thousand troops. Temujin hastily gathered together his followers to defend against the attack, but he was decisively beaten in the Battle of Dalan Balzhut. Jamukha horrified people greatly and harmed his image by boiling seventy young male captives alive in cauldrons, alienating many of his potential followers and eliciting sympathy for Temujin. Toghrul, as Temujin's patron, was exiled to the Qara Khitai. The life of Temujin for the next ten years is very unclear, as historical records are mostly silent on that period.", "text_perturb": "As Jamukha and Temujin drifted apart in their friendship , each began consolidating power , and soon became contender.

Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIVAIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms.
