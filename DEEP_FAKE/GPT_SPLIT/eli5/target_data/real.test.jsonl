{"original_text": "Major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) like AT T and Verizon are actually required to provide wholesale access to their DSL network services for the purpose of allowing other smaller third-party ISPs to compete in the market and offer their own internet service to customers. This is how companies like [DSL Extreme] (URL0) are able to offer internet service to customers throughout the United States in both AT T and Verizon regions. However, in the United States, the FCC regulations that mandate this type of wholesale network access only apply to basic ADSL service offerings. This means that companies like AT T and Verizon only have to provide smaller third-party ISPs with access to 6-8 Mbps DSL lines to customers. Obviously this presents a problem because most major ISPs now offer much higher bandwidth ADSL2, VDSL, cable, or fiber services that are much faster. As a result, these smaller third-party ISPs can't really compete with the DSL lines they can rent from AT T and Verizon which are both low-bandwidth and costly (the wholesale rates in many cases exceed retail rates for the equivalent service offering by the major ISPs).

Since Europeans didn't really stick around in the other places, the native culture stayed as the predominant culture.,The Americas were basically depopulated when the colonial era dawned, because of the Eurasian diseases that Columbus and his successors brought over.

Significant European populations started coming across in the early 1600s, while that didn't happen in Africa until the 1800s.

They're heavily mixed with the natives, and while European culture and language are more dominant, the ethnicity is quite mixed.

Also , because of all that empty land , the Americas were much more amenable to immigration - vast numbers of poor European fannie farmer came to the Midwest to become well-off fannie farmer in the 19th century , but they only could do that because of policies like `` Show up and you get a quarter of a square mile free and clear. `` No empty land , no farms to give away to European goth. Also , it 's worth mention that Central and South Americans are n't `` white '' for the most part. They 're heavily mixed with the natives , and while European culture and language are more dominant , the ethnicity be quite mixed. Brazilians may verbalize Portugese , but they do n't generally look like Portugese people.

Hence the upper class in those countries is snowy , the middle is Indian and the lower classes are the natives. See Kenya , united republic of tanzania , Trinidad , Jamaica etc. ' , 'North America , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa were settlement colonies , were the excess population of Britain could get brassy , fertile land. There was large white settlements in other African colonies but they mostly were empty after they got independence. India , and the other colonies were resource colonies , they were there to course european industry with cheap resources ' , `` In Australia and America , there was lots of land available for European style towns and farms , so it was easy to get people to move there who wanted a fresh start. Africa has plenty of land , but you just ca n't live there like you can in Europe ( except in South Africa , where there was ashen settlement ). Arabia ( and the middle east in general ) as well as India constitute full of cities and towns in every good spot , since they constitute civilized long before the land in Western Europe , so there was no reason to move there , and there constitute enough people locally , the Europeans just hired them to labor and fight for them. , Western folks toss off the native Americans and Australians with epidemic diseases such as chickenpox , smallpox , influenza and measles. There had been trade between Europe , Africa , and Asia for thousands of years , so people in those areas already had immunity to these disease. At first the contagion were accidental. When settlers figured out what constitute going on , however , they would sometimes do it on purpose. [ Giving indians cover infected with smallpox ] ( URL0 ) was considered to be a good trick.

{"original_text": "The reasoning behind it is, for the most part, to prevent honest people from being made homeless because of dishonest landlordsowners. In theory, you could get a gullible person to pay rent without a lease, and the moment the cash is in hand, the landlord calls the cops and gets them hauled out. Without a paper trail saying that they were truly tenants and paid rent, there's nothing stopping this from happening. Honest people are now homeless and without the money they paid because they were taken advantage of. So instead of dragging them out by the ankles, the cops leave it to the courts to decide who is actually in the right, and then act accordingly. It's not a perfect system, and people certainly take advantage, but not as many as you would think. There's a reason these stories are newsworthy, they're the exception. It's also not true that you can't do anything about it, you can. You just have to file with the courts to get them removed.

A belief that you 're a motherfucking dragon in human being form might be indicative of deeper issues. , The APA 's official stance on Gender Disphoria is that as long as it does not cause the suffere any psychological stress or anxiety , it is all normal and acceptable. Really ? I think , rather , that APA states it needs to cause psychological stress or anxiety to be diagnosed as a upset. APA does not utilise words like `` normal '' and `` acceptable '' when describing a diagnosis. Those live different things than not having a diagnosable disorder. Disorders do n't make it into the DSM unless they are comparatively common. Delusions as to age ( as confirmable as biologic sex ) and race ( a social construct ) would probably fall under Delusional Disorder or a similar diagnosis , like someone who thinks they are Napoleon ( and those people truly believe that their delusion is realthey do n't believe the factual circumstances ).

Obviously , there are clear characteristics of different sexes , and though that 's a little less black-and-white than people think , it is a real affair. The idea of gender , though , a set of personality traits and societal roles , is socially constructed. Think of it this way : race represent inherited from your parents , but gender represent not. ( What we call race is actually just a particular hardening of physical characteristics , but I digress ). A inglorious baby is born inglorious , because their parents are inglorious , and they genetically inherit a bunch of physical traits from their parents. The sexual urge , however , is not genetic , but hormonalchromosomal , and does n't come from the parents. And the gender , boy or girl , is assigned by a doctor after a coup doeil at the genitals.

Cartilage usually attaches to bone or connects in such a way that leaves marks. Beyond this we can look at their closest relatives. Dinosaurs were the ancestors to birds, which have no ears. Dinosaurs were cousins to lizards and other large reptiles, who again have no ears and kind of suck for hearing. While they may have had ears in the sense of audio sensing organs, they almost certainly did not have ears as we recognize on mammals. Edit- Officially my highest rated comment ever,\" \"It's notable that for animals that we've only found skeletons that artist depictions are probably missing things like loose skin and fat deposits. Unfortunately I can't find a better source so Buzzfeed it shall be. Two paleontologists took skeletons of modern animals and sketched them the way we've been historically sketching dinosaurs. URL1 Granted they took a good bit of artistic liberty for emphasis.,We have found dinosaurs with an outline of their skin fossilized and some with organs. Recently they found a dinosaur so well preserved they are calling it a dinosaur mummy. URL2','The remains from cartilaginous protrusions would be visible in sedimentary deposits. For example, look at [this] (URL3) cast made from the body of someone who died in Pompeii during the Vesuvius explosion. His cartilaginous nose is visible. Dinosaurs would have left similar impressions.', \"I'm not a relevant expert, but doesn't cartilage usually attach to bones leaving telltale marks? Measurements of tendon attachment points gives information about muscle size, for example...,\" \"The short answer is, we can't know for sure 100, from dinosaur to dinosaur. But there are some things we do know. Impressions left by dinosaurs haven't shown us anything weird yet. Birds tend not to have cartilaginous ears and noses, so it's unlikely their ancestors did. And also, cartilage leaves very minute traces of their existence in the form of bone shape, and stress points. For an example, look at the skull of an elephant. We can guess just by examining it really closely how much weight the muscles surrounding the skull were supporting, and where a protrusion was likely based on tiny grooves left on the bone near the nose left by muscle. Logically, if such grooves were present in dinosaur bone, we could conclude similar protrusions. Nothing we've found so far seems to suggest cartilaginous protrusions, but that could change with just the right specimen. Source: Am volunteer who worked on dinosaur bone, who asked this exact question to my Paleontologist supervisors.,\" \"We don't for sure. The only dinosaurs we have actually seen are all feather and fly around, and those don't have noses or ears like humans (although they do have those dangly turkey do-dahs in certain species) Other dinosaurs were probably more similar to modern day reptiles, which again don't tend to have these protrusions. It is hard to know what something looks like when you only have bones to go on.,At one point it was theorized that sauropods had trunks. URL4','Sometimes dinosaur fossils are preserved with skin impressions or other remains (e.g., keratin in dermal spines, beaks, or claws). Some did have \"non-bone\" structures that protruded out from the body. For example, [some sauropod dinosaurs had spikes along their back] (URL6) [PDF], and [skin impressions are known] (URL5) [PDF]. Getting such preservation in key parts of the body is a matter of great luck, but for some dinosaurs and some parts of the body there are constraints on the possibility of soft-tissue \"protrusions., \"Okay, so I've rambled about crocs a bit, but in regards to dinosaurs themselves... There are such things as'dino mummies', where some flesh also turned to stone along with the bones during fossilisation. Like that nodosaur, the armoured dino in the news recently. I believe the only major soft-tissue one was an Edmontosaurus, where they found it had a comb on the top of its head, much like a chicken does. There are 2D variants for smaller animals, like how Archeopteryx still has its feathers preserved. I believe the most relevant is a 125 million year old mammal called Spinolestes that was preserved in enough detail that you could still see the ears. As far as I know there haven't been any records of cartilaginous extensions.,You can actually construct a phylogenetic tree that correctly places saurusthician dinosaurs, such as T. Rex, as the ancestors of modern birds. You would see that nowhere along the genetic tree did cartiligeous appendages appear between dinos and birds, so we find it likely that dinos did not have ears or a discrete nose. We also base it on the musculoskeletal structure we see in fossils, and we model facial features. Basically, dinosaurs did not have the proper musculature to move their ears if they had them, so we find it unlikely once again.', \"We have found preserved enough heads to know that at least those specific dinosaurs had no protruding ears.

If you are talking to someone who says something like \"oh it's just a virus,\" in a way that implies distinction from an \"infection\" (in their mind at least), they are likely making the distinction between a bacterial infection and a viral infection like \"the cold\" or a \"stomach virus.\" This is in sharp contrast to the type of infection you get on a wound, like when someone says \"oh cover that up before it gets infected.\" That type of infection is characterized by severe inflammation and tissue damage and necrosis, etc. The two broadly defined types of \"viruses\" mentioned above are widely regarded as being temporary conditions which you just have to suffer through for a few days before your body gets its act together and suppresses it. While there are some bacterial infections that are minor and can be handled by relatively mild anti-biotics, there are also many that are much more severe than your common cold. The differences between viruses and bacteriafungiother things that can make you sick is that viruses are the robots of the germ world. They don't replicate themselves like other life forms do. There are actually a wide class viruses known as bacteriophages which attack other bacteria and use them to make copies of themselves. Basically what a virus does is attack and attach itself to another cell (plant, animal, sometimes has to be specific) and inject its RNA into the cell. That RNA then corrupts the cells normal activity and overhauls it into a virus making factory, which produces the different body parts of a virus, then puts them together to make new viruses. Then depending on whether the virus is of the lytic or lysogenic variety, it either explodes the cell popping the new viruses everywhere, or it goes into a dormant state waiting for different conditions to continue activity. This is how all viruses replicate themselves. Another difference is that viruses can never be fully eliminated from the body the way other diseases can. This is because of the way they replicate themselves. This is opposed to having a bacteria that comes in and divides itself and maybe eats your tissue like gangrene or something. Your body can come in guns blazing, and once the last bacteria cell is killed, its game over. Viruses put their RNA into your normal cells DNA, so whenever your immune system goes down a bit, the virus might pop its head back up. (Think Herpes). So if the virus is in the lysogenic cycle I mentioned earlier, not exploding your cells, then that means whenever your cell replicates itself by mitosis, the viral RNA is also replicated, and you have another potential virus making factory on your hands.
