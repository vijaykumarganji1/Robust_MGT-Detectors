Maybe his interactions with North Korea will help them see the light and not want to continue being insane? - On another level, by befriending Kim Jong-Un, is Dennis Rodman condoning North Korea's horrendous domestic and international policies? It's a difficult one, but I like to stick to the former, because it can't hurt to try, right? EDIT: Formatting and a few words!,The direct answer is because he is invited by the head of state in North Korea. The idea of this happening is absurd for most observers of North Korea. What we all believe is how tightly controlled NK is,and how people who visit are guided at all times. There are only a few approved haircuts, TV and radio are all governed by the state. So nobody is allowed to see what goes on in the real world. Now contrast this with Dennis Rodman, a controversial figure even in the US. Being invited by the head of NK to visit. The man does not have an approved haircut, he has metal parts on his face, he does not know any decorum as how to treat the head of state. Now if he was just allowed to meet secretly with the leader that would make more sense. But in fact they have large events where Rodman participates. NK has sent a baseball team to the US to train. Rodman has met quite a few NK people, and been seen by many thousands. The NK people (only some of them) now have to process that people can look like that, behave like that. Its a shocking experience I am sure. We should not underestimate the importance of these events. Rodman is an ambassador of sports sure, but also of American culture. What he is not is a directly political ambassador. I think it is awesome that these exchanges takes place. They are tiny microsteps, and even some not that small. that may give a glimpse of a slight softening up in North Korea.

Depends on where you have citizenship, and you do take the risk that today is the day they decide to kidnap all the tourists in the country and hold them hostage. But it is possible to go on'guided' tours. Rodman as others say is there by invitation, and, importantly, US government rules on travelling to the DPRK are bad, but not as bad as they could be. You're not going to end up in jail for having spent money there while travelling.,The Kims have always been known to have harems of Women chosen for their beauty plucked for their families for the use by the state. These women are used to entertain members of state as well as their guests. Rodman is well renowned for his drug use, partying, and sexual deviancy. Who knows what really was happening over there, but I am sure he was partying his ass off.','First let's dispel a couple myths. American's can enter North Korea on tour groups during certain times of the year.

EDIT : Formatting and a few words ! , The direct answer is because he is invited by the head of state in North korean peninsula. The idea of this happening is absurd for most percipient of North Korea. What we all believe is how tightly controlled NK is , and how people who visit are guided at all fourth dimension. There are only a few approved haircuts , TV and receiving set are all governed by the state. So nobody live allowed to see what goes on in the real world. Now contrast this with Dennis Rodman , a controversial figure even in the usa. comprise invited by the head of NK to visit. The man does not have an approved haircut , he has metal parts on his face , he does not know any decorousness as how to treat the head of state.

{"original_text": "First, let me tell you what it means when a cell is not immortal. Normal human cells can divide. 1 cell becomes 2. 2 cells become 4. 4 cells become 8. But most human cells have a limit - they can't just keep on doubling forever. They can only divide so many times before a built-in safeguard says \"that's enough, no more division.\" So 8 becomes 16, 16 becomes 32, 32 becomes 64, but then it stops. 64 is the end. An immortal cell is one that doesn't have a built-in limit. It can keep on dividing forever: 64, 128, 256, 512,..., one million, two million.... one billion, two billion, four billion, until it takes over everything. A cell that's abnormal but not immortal can form a small tumor, but the tumor's growth stops when the cells hit the division limit. Because of that, a cell that's abnormal but not immortal isn't considered \"cancer\" - the limit prevents it from growing and spreading. Instead, it's called a \"precancerous condition\" - the cells are abnormal and are forming a tumor, but until a mutation causes the division limit to be removed, they won't kill you - yet. HeLa is actually a cervical cancer cell. Like all cancer cells, it's immortal - if it weren't immortal, they wouldn't call it \"cancer,\" they would call it \"precancerous.\" It is possible to take a normal human cell and remove the division limit in the laboratory - ie, \"immortalize\" it. This can be useful for scientists, since they need to be able to grow the cells in the lab, and they don't want some built-in division limit to tell them they have to start over.','Not an expert but well read and not like you're 5 but like you don't know much about cells: Cells in your body will divide to form new cells. Due to complicated reasons, in order for a cell to divide and make a new copy, some chemicals have to read the original cell but they can't really make it all the way to the end of that cell, so they would lose some of the information at the end of the DNA strand. To get around this, the chromosomes (which consist of DNA protein) have a kind of tail at the end of largely non important material called a Telomere. They basically stretch out the chromosomes so that the enzymes can copy the information without losing anything at the end. In normal cell division, since a little information is lost at the end of each copy, this equates to the telomeres being lost a little bit on each copy. The telomeres whole job is to be lost rather than critical information in the DNA. In practice, depending on the cell type, they get completely used up in 40-60 copies, which is known as the Hayflick limit (discovered by Leonard Hayflick in 1961). Why does this happen? No one is completely sure, but it's believed that this mechanism helps to prevent cancer (the more times a cell divides, the more chances there are for genetic errors) and other genetic problems. It's also believed to be the mechanism responsible for aging and death. So on to HeLa. Cancer cells are cells with genetic errors, that is, errors in the DNA that make them grow rapidly. Many cancer cells, including HeLa, also produce an enzyme called Telomerase. This enzyme has the ability to tack on a few bits of information to the end of a chromosome, thus keeping the telomeres from getting shorter. It's an enzyme that is normally found in embrionic stem cells (to allow rapid unlimited cell division to form a new baby) and in some other cells that need to divide frequently (like immune cells). However in cancer cells it gets turned on due to a genetic defect and allows them to multiply out of control. So in summary, HeLa cells are \"immortal\" because they are cancer cells, and what cancer cells do is grow quickly and without the normal cell death after 40-60 divisions. This is not unique to HeLa cells, however they happen to copy particularly fast and were the first line of cancerous cells to be reliably cultured in the lab.", "text_perturb": "First , let me tell you what it mean when a cell is not immortal. Normal human cells can divide. 1 cell go 2. 2 cellphone become 4. 4 jail cell become 8. But most human cells have a limit - they ca n't barely keep on doubling forever. They can only divide so many times before a integral safeguard says `` that 's enough , no more division. `` So 8 becomes 16 , 16 becomes 32 , 32 becomes 64 , but then it barricade. 64 constitute the end. An immortal cell is one that make n't have a built-in limit. It can keep on split up forever : 64 , 128 , 256 , 512 ,. . . , one million , two million. . . . one billion , two billion , four billion , until it deal over everything. A cell that 's abnormal but not immortal can form a small tumor , but the tumor 's growth stops when the cells make the division limit. Because of that , a cell that 's abnormal but not immortal is n't considered `` genus cancer '' - the limit prevents it from growing and spreading. Instead , it 's yell a `` precancerous condition '' - the cells are abnormal and are forming a tumor , but until a mutation causes the division limit to be removed , they wo n't kill you - yet. HeLa is actually a cervical cancer the crab cell. Like all cancer cells , it 's immortal - if it were n't immortal , they would n't predict it `` cancer , '' they would predict it `` precancerous. `` It is possible to take a normal human cell and withdraw the division limit in the laboratory - ie , `` immortalize '' it.

{"original_text": "A significant part of male pattern baldness (the type of baldness I assume your are talking about) is due to genetics and the hormone dihydrotestosterone. baldness is caused due to the sensitivity of the hair follicle to that hormone. topical treatments can reduce the effect of the hormone on a patch of hair (Propecia and Avodart) but a \"cure\" would require major alterations to either the production of the hormone or to the sensitivity of the follicle. either one of these would be likely to produce significant (possibly dangerous) side effects in the patient. so far no permanent treatment has made it through enough clinical trials to be considered effective and safe.', \"24 here, almost 25y old. Using minoxodil for two years now. We lose our hair mainly in the center part of the head'cause the follicles in that area are susceptible to the hormone dihydrotestosterone. The follicles on the sides are much less susceptible, and we don't really understand why yet. This hormone is a result of the processes that the much more known Testosterone endures in the body. To fight the presence of the dihydro variant, you have to fight Testosterone itself. Finasteride does exactly this. If you use it you're very likely to even get hair back. My granddad was using this at 70 to help his prostate and was growing hair back. The problem with Finasteride is that it will give you hair but you are also pretty likely to lose libido, to get erectile disfunction and there seems to be cases of sterility. That's why I never accepted it. The alternative is Minoxidil, which will make the process slower by giving the follicles where you apply it more breathing room before the Dihydrotestosterone kills them. This is what I'm using, till it gets to that point where shaving just looks better and then that's the way to go. When you're bald you can consider autotransplant: they'll get your sane follicles from back and sided and put it on the center part. Elon Musk has had a transplant, if you're interested on how much successful it can be. He's a much more handsome man now,Depending on you what you qualify as a solution, one might say there is currently a solution to baldness. The solution, however, is surgical. The hair on the top of your head is different than the hair on the crownsides of your head. The hair on the top of your head is susceptible to [DHT or Dihydrotestosterone] (URL4). The hair on your head is in a constant state of shedding and regrowth. DHT strangles the follicle which makes the regrowth hair come back smaller and less healthy that the hair it replace. Eventually the follicle gets so strangled that the hair that replaces the original is microscopic and seemingly gone. This is when baldness occurs. [Medical Hair Restoration, or hair transplantation] (URL0) is an effective solution to baldness if the end goal is to not look like a bald person. What it involves is moving a specific number of hairs from the sides of your head to the top of your head. It doesn't cure the underlying \"problem\" but it masks the results of that problem to a degree. The issues with this treatment is that if you get it prematurely (before you're actually bald), you will have to go multiple times as the non-surgically-replaced hair falls out. Some doctors only recommend 3 maximum hair replacement surgeries, so they often recommend waiting until you're significantly bald or start a regime of drugs after your first surgery. Often people will fix problem spots with the surgery, then start takingusing medications like [finasteride] (URL3) and [minoxidil] (URL1). The surgery effectively \"fixed\" the thinningbald areas and the drugs prevent future hair from falling out. The problem with the above mentioned technique is that often, the drugs can have [serious side effects] (URL2). In the end, however, you can be successful in \"curing\" the effects of baldness. Unfortunately there's no simple, non-invasive or potentially chemically dangerous solution.','Just a reminder here: although this is more visible (in most cases) in males, females also suffer from androgenetic alopecia. It can be incredibly devastating emotionally and cause severe depression. So the \"shave it, get used to it\" line is not always an option. Propecia (Finasteride) is strictly banned for women who are in a reproductive age, as it can cause feminization of male fetuses.', \"The cure of baldness will always be 10 years away.

There's so much BS snake-oil out there, and so many otherwise expensive methods with ok effects. Hopefully I'll still have a decent head of hair 5-10 years from now.,There are [expensive] solutions. Hair transplants have come a long way. Certain countries like Turkey do the procedure for a more affordable price.','Changing eye color is removing the pigment with a laser. \"Curing\" male pattern baldness would require changing male genetic code in a way that it didn't interfere with normal male physiology.

None of them are a cure, but can slow down the process.', \"There are solutions, but they are: A: Expensive B: Not permanent C: Cause other, possibly unwanted, changes to your body. A is obvious. Its a cosmetic situation. Implants and medicine that take care of cosmetic issues are expensive because they are luxuries. B is due to the cause of baldness being primarily a hormone issue. If you don't solve the hormone problem implants will fall back out in time. C is related to B. If you take testosterone blockers to keep and possibly regrow your hair, your libido will die. You may lose the ability to get erect and will likely be infertile and possibly grow breasts. C works for me.

There's no way to predict what is important for the solution to a complex problem and what is just a red herring until after you've solved the problem. Anyway... There are actually plenty of solutions to baldness. But the problem is that they aren't viewed as acceptable (whether medically or socially). Toupees are a \"solution\" to baldness, but people think they look goofy. Women wear wigs all the time, and they can be difficult to distinguish from natural hair, and the same can be said of high-end toupees. But the toupee has become a meme representing socially inept or unacceptable schlubs. Hair transplantation is another option that quite literally eliminates the defining factor of baldness: the lack of hair in an area. People still question its ability to make \"normal-looking\" hairlines, but that is mostly informed by past techniques and not more advanced current approaches. So you're not really asking for a solution to baldness so much as an easily accessible, socially and medically acceptable solution to baldness with no or minimal side effects. And adding those caveats to \"solution\" makes it a great deal more complicated. If you're talking about pharmaceutically treating hair loss, that's a slightly different issue. Firstly, male pattern baldness (or \"androgenic baldness\" because it can affect women too) is genetic, and it is very difficult, if not impossible, to \"treat\" genetic disorders. You can't really change the genes in a person (barring some exceedingly technical andor experimental approaches). Your best hope is to eliminate the symptoms, which can be done with some of the approaches I've mentioned above. Secondly, baldness is related to hormonal signaling. Playing with hormones is difficult and can have some pretty severe side effects, most of which aren't acceptable when your goal is cosmetic.', \"Permanent solutions based on current understanding of the problem (which is incomplete) require either 1. Modification of the area where the chemical (DHT) which causes the damage attaches. 2. Modification of the chemical which causes the damage 3.

All of these things are either genetic modifications which are expensive and going to be focused on other genetic diseases or issues in which we're not sure on how to manage without large-scale side effects.

{"original_text": "Because we've yet to see an attempt at implementation that hasn't involved things like forced sterilizations or racialethnically charged violence. Yes, in theory eugenics is not a bad concept. Controlling our evolution as a species to breed a certain profile of \"good\" traits is not a bad idea.... except not everyone agrees on what \"good\" means. On top of that, Humans are tribal by nature and we have not demonstrated the ability to not turn an \"us vs. them\" situation into anything but a potential violence point.','Even from a purely scientific POV what you're suggesting is akin to how people breed dogs. Encouraging some traits while discouraging others via artifcial selection. BUT as a result the gene pool for dog breeds is highly stagnant with an incredibly high risk for a litany of diseases and a fraction of the life span they should have. The problem with eugenics is we can't even begin to understand the level of complexity that is how DNA shapes us. Even an objective attempt in modern time to just make a race of human with the best qualities would most likely be the human equivalent of a british bulldog; a sad, sick abomination. You may think \"oh but we mapped the genome surely we could work it out\" well we don't know everything about it yet. Think of it this way, 60 years ago people genuinely thought they had a 100 understanding of genetics and that eugenics was the natural next step. Just think of what kind of abominable world we would live in if they had their way then.','Totally voluntary eugenics may not be evil such as paying men with outstanding genes to become sperm donors so they have more offspring. Unfortunately most eugenics programs start to cross the line into involuntary aspects, such as telling some people they are not allowed to have children, or only one child. This strikes many people as a violation of a human right, since there is a human instinct to reproduce.','In part, as CommitteeOfOne suggests, the hard question to answer is \"who gets to decide what a desirable trait is?\" It shouldn't be government, because they have strong incentives to make a pliable and agreeable population who is easy to control. So, if parents get to decide, perhaps they will make good decisions. To some extent, I think that abortion is similar to eugenics, because you get to choose which traits come into existence, and which ones don't. Selective abortion is often used by parents these days to terminate pregnancies which would produce children with disabilities if they came to term, which I think is a good freedom of choice for parents to have. There are (what I consider to be) negative versions of abortion, such as sex-selective abortion that sway me away from freedom to abort somewhat.

Yes , in theory eugenics is not a regretful concept. Controlling our evolution as a species to breed a certain visibility of `` good '' traits is not a bad idea. . . . except not everyone agrees on what `` good '' means. On top of that , Humans are tribal by nature and we have non demonstrated the ability to non turn an `` us vs. them '' situation into anything but a potential fierceness point. ' , 'Even from a purely scientific POV what you 're suggesting is akin to how the great unwashed breed dogs. further some traits while discouraging others via artifcial selection. BUT as a result the gene pool for dog breeds is highly stagnant with an incredibly high hazard for a litany of diseases and a fraction of the life span they should have. The problem with eugenics constitute we ca n't even begin to understand the level of complexity that constitute how DNA shapes us. Even an objective endeavor in modern time to just make a race of human with the best qualities would most likely be the human equivalent of a british bulldog ; a sad , sick abomination. You may think `` oh but we mapped the genome surely we could work it out '' well we serve n't know everything about it yet. Think of it this way , 60 years ago people genuinely thought they suffer a 100 understanding of genetics and that eugenics was the natural next step. Just think of what kind of awful world we would live in if they had their way then. ' , 'Totally voluntary eugenics may not be evil such as paying men with outstanding genes to become sperm donors so they have to a greater extent offspring. Unfortunately most eugenics programs start to cross the line into involuntary aspects , such as telling some people they are not allowed to make children , or only one child. This strikes many citizenry as a violation of a human right , since there is a human instinct to reproduce. ' , 'In part , as CommitteeOfOne suggests , the hard question to answer is `` who incur to decide what a desirable trait is ? '' It should n't be government , because they have strong incentives to make a pliable and agreeable population who is easy to control. So , if parents get to decide , perhaps they will make in effect decisions. To some extent , I think that abortion is similar to eugenics , because you get to choose which traits come into cosmos , and which ones do n't. Selective abortion is often used by parents these days to terminate maternity which would produce children with disabilities if they came to term , which I think is a good freedom of choice for parents to have. There are ( what I consider to be ) negative versions of abortion , such as sex-selective abortion that sway me away from exemption to abort somewhat.

For this reason, the comment about them being useless on front-wheel-drive vehicles is entirely incorrect. Aerodynamic aids can (and most definitely are) built into the front of vehicles to create downforce over the front wheels. Without these downforce-generating structures, the general shape of a vehicle (flat on the bottom, curved over the top) can often imitate the function of a plane's wing - the lower air pressure over the top of the vehicle causes lift to be generated at high speeds, leading to instability. Generally this is insignificant on normal road-going passenger vehicles, but high performance sports car, supercars, and race cars are often capable of speeds where it can be an issue. A related factor is weight. Normal passenger vehicles are usually noticably heavier than their sportsrace counterparts.

This allows in a mixture of air and gasoline vapor. When the piston reaches the bottom, the intake valve closes and it starts to go back up, compressing the fuelair mixture. When the piston reaches the top again, the spark plug fires and ignites the fuelair mixture, as it burns it expands and forces the piston down. This is where the power comes from. When the piston reaches the bottom, and starts back up, the exhaust valve opens and the burnt fuelair is pushed out by the piston rising. The exhaust valve closes as the piston reaches the top and the cycle starts again. The most important system apart from the actual cylinders and pistons is the powertrain. It transfers the engine's power to the road. It starts with the pistons, they connect to a crankshaft that turns their back-and-forth motion into rotation. This then connects to the transmission, which allows the wheels to spin at a wider range of speeds than the speed range at which the engine can run. This then connects to the differential, which allows the wheels to spin at different speeds in order to turn smoothly, then this connects to the axles and wheels. The other end of the crankshaft connects to the camshafts (these open and close the engine valves) via the timing belt. It's called the timing belt because the valves have to be synchronized with the pistons for the engine to run. It has another belt pulley on it that drives other stuff like the radiator fan, alternator, power steering pump and air conditioning compressor. The air coming into the engine starts at the air intake and air filter, this keeps debris out. It then goes to the intake manifold, which distributes it to the cylinders. Right before the intake valve, fuel injectors inject vaporized fuel into it. The fuel system is pretty simple, there's a low-pressure pump in the gas tank that pushes it through a line to the engine, then a high-pressure pump that forces it through the injectors. What ignites the fuelair is the spark plugs, they use a high-voltage electric spark. This electricity comes from an alternator, a small generator driven by the engine. A coil raises the low voltage provided by the alternator to high voltage that can make a spark. The distributor uses the engine's rotation to time the firing of the spark plugs. The alternator also charges the battery. The battery's main job is to power the starter motor, which starts the engine. The alternator and battery also power all the car's other electric devices. The burning of the fuel produces a lot of heat, so the engine has to be cooled. It has coolant channels running all through it, and hoses leading to the big radiator at the front of the engine compartment. A pump circulates coolant in a loop between the engine, where it heats up, and the radiator, where it's cooled. The motion of the car forces air through the radiator to cool the coolant, as does a large fan driven by the engine. The coolant also goes through a mini-radiator called the heater core, this provides hot air to the inside of the car (and this is why there's no heat before the engine warms up). The coolant can't be allowed to freeze, so it includes a chemical called antifreeze that has a very low freezing point. The engine also needs oil to keep parts from rubbing against each other and eventually getting stuck. It collects in the bottom of the engine and is pumped all through the cylinders, crankshaft, and camshafts to lubricate them. Sometimes you need to add more, sometimes you need to change it out completely. Finally, you have the exhaust system. The exhaust valves lead to the exhaust manifold, which collects the exhaust from all the cylinders int a single pipe. This goes to the catalytic converter which cleans the exhaust, then to the muffler which makes it quieter, then finally to the tailpipe. Then there are a lot of other systems that aren't directly related to the engine like brakes, AC, power steering etc. You'll see parts of these systems under the hood as well.,\" \" Hello, I'm vaguely familiar with how a car's motor works but I'd like to understand it better, and understand the function of the specific parts.

{"original_text": "A new study by musicologists in Europe suggests that the shape of our ear canals, as well as our own perceptions, is to blame for our distaste in such shrill sounds. The researchers, who presented their work on Nov. 3 at a meeting of the Acoustical Society of America, began their experiment by subjecting study participants to various unpleasant noises, such as a fork scraping against a plate or Styrofoam squeaks. The participants rated their discomfort with each sound, allowing the researchers to identify the two worst sounds: fingernails scratching on a chalkboard and a piece of chalk running against slate. They then created variations of these two sounds by modifying certain frequency ranges, removing the harmonic portions, or getting rid of the grating, noisy parts. They told half of the listeners the true source of the sounds, and the other half that the sounds came from pieces of contemporary music. Finally, they played back the new sounds for the participants, all the while monitoring certain indicators of stress, such as heart rate, blood pressure and the electrical conductivity of skin.

The researchers , who presented their workplace on Nov. 3 at a meeting of the Acoustical Society of America , began their experimentation by subjecting study participants to various unpleasant noises , such as a fork scraping against a plate or Styrofoam squeaks. The participant rated their discomfort with each sound , allowing the researchers to identify the two worst sounds : fingernails scratching on a chalkboard and a piece of chalk running against slate. They then created variations of these two strait by modifying certain frequency ranges , removing the harmonic portions , or getting rid of the grating , noisy parts. They told one half of the listeners the true source of the sounds , and the other one half that the sounds came from pieces of contemporary music. Finally , they played back the new sounds for the participants , all the while monitoring certain indicators of tension , such as heart rate , blood pressure and the electrical conductivity of skin.

{"original_text": "Humans are social creatures. We live and work and play with each other. We need rules that protect everybody from everybody else. These rules are sometimes called laws or ethics. When you talk about the collective rules of a society and of personal interaction, you are talking about ethics.', \"Ethics are a set of guidelines that are derived from single or multiple moral philosophies. Mostly, because it's derived from moral philosophies, it is meant to understand the relationship between good and evil, right and wrong. Some principles of ethics include; Aristotle's Golden Mean Kant's Categorical Imperative Judeo-Christian philosophy relating to the Agape Principle Using these principles, or others gathered, in my communication ethics class we used a [potterbox] (URL0) as a model for making an ethical decision. In the first box, you list the facts and definition at hand with the goal of displaying only facts without bias or misrepresentation. In the second box you referencing the values in question and understanding how they come into play in a specific ethical situation. In the third box, you use principles (like Aristotle's Golden Mean) as models of ethical reasoning that may apply to the situation at hand. In the final box, the decision makers loyalties come into play. The decision maker must identify hisher allegiances and weight the actionsreactions that will occur with each possible ethical decision. This is just the tip of the ice-burg in terms of ethics, however. Ethics is a broad term for many different philosophies, beliefs, methodologies and opinions.,The short answer is evolution. This, however, raises the question \"why was having ethics a reproductive advantage?\" I'll do my best to give my understanding of this at the simplest level I can: In the ancestral environment, people had the choice of behaving 'nice' and working together with the rest of their tribe, or behaving 'naughty' and working for their own self alone. People in the tribe who play nice don't let people they know to play naughty to play with them. This means that people with a reputation of playing naughty don't get to have children since the nice people won't let them. This is, essentially, why most people are nice - because more nice people had nice children than naughty people had naughty children. Now, this only explains why people who get caught being naughty don't reproduce well.

When you talk about the collective rules of a society and of personal interaction , you are mouth about ethics. ' , `` Ethics are a set of guidelines that are derived from single or multiple moral school of thought. Mostly , because it 's derived from moral philosophies , it personify meant to understand the relationship between good and evil , right and wrong. Some principles of ethics include ; Aristotle 's Golden Mean Kant 's Categorical Imperative Judeo-Christian philosophy relating to the agape love Principle Using these principles , or others gathered , in my communication ethics class we used a [ potterbox ] ( URL0 ) as a model for making an ethical decision.

This , withal , raises the question `` why was having ethics a reproductive advantage ? '' I 'll do my best to give my understanding of this at the simplest level I can : In the ancestral environment , people had the choice of behaving 'nice ' and working together with the rest of their tribe , or behaving 'naughty ' and working for their own self alone. People in the tribe who play nice do n't let people they fuck to play naughty to play with them. This means that people with a reputation of playing naughty do n't arrest to have children since the nice people wo n't let them. This is , essentially , why most people are nice - because more nice people take nice children than naughty people take naughty children.

These are brittle materials, like glass or porcelain. But other materials don't snap immediately. These are ductile materials. In ductile materials, an interesting thing happens: yield. At the yield point, the elastic deformation gives way to [plastic deformation] (URL2). In plastic deformation, the material becomes much less stiff, and begins to deform permanently.

{"original_text": "It's largely politics. Unions tend to be very strong supporters of the Democratic party, and that doesn't sit well with Republicans. But, for some specific points of contention: Unions fight for what they think is a fair wage. Some people think that wage is unreasonably high. Unions support closed shop laws, which make it illegal to hold certain jobs if you're not in a union. Others support right to work laws, because they don't think union membership should be mandatory. In theory, unions work for better conditions for workers. However, some unions are corrupt, linked to organized crime, and hold nonunion workers in contempt.,What I know of my company is that I make much more money than my unionized counterparts at other company locations and my benefits are far superior. We produce a larger quantity and higher quality product as well because we don't have senseless union red tape that allows us to perform our jobs efficiently.

For workers unions are usually a good thing, because the union represents a large number of people in an industry they're in a good position to negotiate better wages and working conditions than any individual would be able to get. The union will also represent you in workplace disputes, and can sometimes provide legal representation. Unions do have some downsides. For example if there are non-unioned workers in an industry it effectively weakens the union's position (why would an employer agree to the union's demands when they can just hire non-union people instead). Therefore in some industries there is a lot of pressure on workers to join unions. If you look around you'll find stories of strong-arm tactics or even open hostility. Employers also find unions difficult to work with. An employer needs to consider the financial situation of their company when considering things like wages, the union doesn't have the same concern and so could make demands greater than the employer can cover, if the employer doesn't meet the demands or negotiate them down then they risk their staff going on strike. The pro-union counterargument is that without unions the employers will have minimal pressure to actually raise wages, and that factors such as workplace favouritism could end up with two employees doing the same work for different amounts of pay, therefore it is better to have the employer and the union negotiate the wage for everyone.,Originally, America was an agrarian society. Most people were farmers who worked small plots of land land was cheap and plentiful, and the government would even give away frontier land to people who would settle and develop it (homesteading). Businesses existed of course, but they were usually small businesses like smiths, barrel makers, etc. Then we got technology like railroads and factories. Which were profitable but required a huge amount of capital. So people started forming more large companies and they became a larger sector of the economy (i.e. people quit farming and started to work for a company). Those large companies discovered they could make more money by exploiting their workers in various ways. Anyone who was unhappy with the working conditions was welcome to quit; there were plenty of more desperate people willing to take their place. Eventually workers got fed up and started banding together for everyone in a company or industry to stop work en masse until improvements were made. Companies responded by simply letting everybody go and hiring replacements, preemptively getting rid of anybody who seemed to be organizing the workers, and hiring ex-felons who weren't too shy about physical violence as private \"security guards\" to break up public marches and demonstrations about a company's business practices. Eventually the American people sided with the workers. The forty-hour workweek, two-day weekend, and child labor laws are all things we take for granted today, but were considered major reforms at the time. Unions gained the right to organize and strike. Unions now being recognized as legitimate entities, rules were put in place to make the process more orderly how negotiations between unions and management take place, how much notice must be given of intent to strike, the relative balance of power between union members and union leadership, under what circumstances workers can must join a union, etc. Corporations can have vast amounts of wealth, political and economic influence, and can \"live\" for centuries. Organized labor can be viewed as a necessary evil to keep companies from simply exploiting their workers. However, now that we're no longer fighting for those sorts of reforms, unions have sort of lost their way.

Who put the -stan in Afghanistan? I don't know about the former, but we can thank the Proto-Indo-Europeans for the latter. These folks spoke the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE), a prehistoric Eurasian language that linguists have reconstructed. The PIE root, st?-, or \"stand,\" found its way into many words in the language's various descendants. The Russian -stan means \"settlement,\" and other Slavic languages use it to mean \"apartment\" or \"state.\" In English, the root was borrowed to make \"stand,\" \"state,\" \"stay\" and other words. The ancient Indo-Iranian peoples descendants of Proto-Indo-Europeans who moved east and south from the Eurasian steppe - used it to mean \"place\" or \"place of.\" It's this meaning that's used for the names of the modern -stan countries, which got it through linguistic descent (Urdu and Pashto, the respective official languages of Pakistan and Afghanistan, both descend from the Indo-Iranian language), or by adopting it (the former Soviet -stan countries have historically been mostly ethnically Turkic and speak languages from the Turkic family).', \"Stan means'land' and -dadbad means city. Bagh is garden. Bagh-dad Garden city. Islamabad, etc.,Stan\" means land. It is related to the Latin word \"state,\" the German word for city, \"Stadt\" and the English suffix -stead, found in words like \"homestead\" and \"farmstead\" and in place names like \"Hampstead\" and \"Stansted.\" The word \"stan\" can be traced back to the same original root word as the European \"statestadtstead\" varieties, because all these words derive from the same ancient theorised language, Proto Indo-European.', \"It's not just Persian. Many Indo-European languages have the word'stan', which means'place'. Even English words like'station' and'stop' probably have a related ancient origin since English is an Indo-European language.,It's funny because the word for Armenia in Armenian is Haiastan. So they have the \"stan\" just not in English.','Bonus fun tidbit: China is actually called Zhong Guo, meaning middle kingdom or middle country. Nobody really knows where the word China comes from and there is no Chinese word for \"China,\" rather the nation is called Zhonghua which has been changed to mean Chinese Nation in modern times. In Chinese, most names of other countries end in Guo. So America is Meiguo, Germany is Deguo, England is Yingguo. Other countries have Mandarin phonetic pronunciations, like Italy being Yi da li. Then there are countries that were named in Chinese or have a common base language, and have actual Chinese names, like Japan being Riben or Wo, Korea being Hanguo, and Vietnam being Yuenan. So where did the word China come from? Nobody knows.

I do n't know about the former , but we can thank the Proto-Indo-Europeans for the latter. These folks spoke the Proto-Indo-European language ( PIE ) , a prehistorical Eurasian language that linguists have reconstructed. The PIE root , st ? - , or `` base , '' found its way into many words in the language 's various descendants. The Russian -stan think `` settlement , '' and other Slavic languages use it to mean `` apartment '' or `` state. `` In English , the root was borrowed to make `` stand , '' `` state , '' `` stay '' and early words. The ancient Indo-Iranian peoples descendants of Proto-Indo-Europeans who moved east and south from the Eurasian steppe - used it to mean `` space '' or `` space of. `` It 's this meaning that 's used for the names of the modern -stan countries , which got it through linguistic descent ( Urdu and afghani , the respective official languages of Pakistan and Afghanistan , both descend from the Indo-Iranian language ) , or by adopting it ( the former Soviet -stan countries have historically been mostly ethnically Turkic and speak languages from the Turkic family ).

Honor in these cultures is defined as not \"losing face,\" that is, maintaining an outward identity that portrays strength and stoicism to others. This is where the image of the laid off Japanese businessman sitting in the park all day comes from- to many in these cultures, admitting you lost your job is perceived as so negative a reflection on yourself that you dare not tell even your own family. Now consider the Asian perspective on family, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea. There are several reasons that people from these cultures tend to view the concept of family differently. For one, Asian culture has traditionally emphasized the concept of \"duty\" far more than Western cultures. American culture in particular has always been very individualistic in the sense that society tends to encourage people to do what's best for them as individuals follow your dreams! whereas in Asian cultures people often feel pressured, either directly or by force of cultural habit, to think in terms of the collective (working for your country, working for your company, working for your family, etc.) Essentially, Asian cultures have always been more group-focused whereas Western cultures, and especially American culture, have always been more individualistic. And what more personal or inescapable group is there than one's own family? So Asian cultures have always been more family-centric than Western ones, which is why multiple generations often live in the same household. For example, a couple's children may delay moving out because they don't want to be seen as abandoning the family or want to continue to help their parents in some way, meanwhile the grandparent (s) might move in as well because they are too old or impoverished to live alone and their children fear that putting them in a retirement home would be seen as abandoning the people who raised them. Also, Asian cultures have historically valued age as a source of wisdom (think about the stereotype of the wizened old sensei or monk.) Contrast this with the American perception of the elderly as like big toddlers that are sometimes seen as more of a nuisance or burden than anything else. Now combine these two: cultures with large and close-knit family units and a historical focus on the concept of honor naturally feature a convergence of these two concepts. To many members of these cultures, anything which draws negative attention to themselves (even things which people in the West typically aren't embarrassed about) can be seen as a negative reflection on one's family.

For example , a couple 's children may delay moving out because they do n't want to be seen as abandoning the menage or want to continue to help their parents in some way , meanwhile the grandparent ( s ) might move in as well because they are too old or impoverished to live alone and their children fear that putting them in a retirement home would be seen as abandoning the people who raised them. Also , asiatic cultures have historically valued age as a source of wisdom ( think about the stereotype of the wizened old sensei or monk. ) Contrast this with the American perception of the elderly as like big toddlers that are sometimes seen as more of a nuisance or gist than anything else. Now combine these two : cultures with large and close-knit family units and a historic focus on the concept of honor naturally feature a convergence of these two concepts. To many members of these cultures , anything which draws negative attention to themselves ( even things which people in the West typically exist n't embarrassed about ) can be seen as a negative reflection on one 's family. If I 'm ashamed of [ matter ] , naturally I may fear that others may judge my parents for raising a son that [ matter ].

As wastes diffuse into the oceans they form a relatively steady concentration balanced between their addition and neutralization.,Your body has many ways to combat microorganisms attempting to infect you.

I find that a fascinating concept, that this entire planet is just thriving with these little specks of life so tiny you cant even visualize them without the use of a magnifying tool. First not all bacteria is bad, the bacteria on your skin does good there, it is only opportunistic meaning an infection wont occur unless it is giving a chance such as a break in your skin integrity. Second your natural bacteria is beneficial as since it is taking up real estate on your skin it prevents other possibly more infectious bacteria to begin growing. Not to mention inside your gastrointestinal tract is an entire cest pool of more beneficial bacteria that does the exact same thing with the added benefit of helping break down food. Now on to the other list. Your first line of defense is your skin, another amazing structure. Water, air, microscopic proof, it does not let anything in nor out unless broken open. Mind you even a microscopic tear say caused by a brush up to hard against something is all that is needed to gain entry. Next is the main access point to inside your body which is your gastrointestinal system. This is a closed system that is closed off from the rest of your body. I once had a BIO professor describe all living animals as a tube inside a tube (your digestive track being its own tube inside the tube which is the rest of your body). Your body has many ways up preventing infection from occurring from what you ingest. First you have mucus all throughout the lining of this system which collects foreign bodies. Your tonsils are big lymphatic organs which in a simplified version are host to a large amount of white blood cells and play a vital role in your immune system. Next you have your stomachs acidity which will denature nearly everything that comes into contact with it effectively destroying most bacteria. It then reaches your intestines where a large host of beneficial bacteria also reside so it would have to compete for nutrients and space from these bacteria. Then out it comes through the other end. Next you have your immune system, it is getting late and I am getting tired so I dont plan on going in great detail. Your body has systems in place to destroy any bacteria or viruses that invade your body that does not belong. There are many forms of white blood cells with different jobs, some track and identify these invaders, some then go out and seek and destroy them, some swallow them up and analyze what they are fighting, some then make antibodies which are proteins geared towards that specific organism with the sole purpose of destroying them. If you manage to not die by the time this happens and your body is flooded with anti bodies, you won and the infection will be vanquished. Your body will then keep some of these antibodies in circulation and your WBC will contain the information to make more incase another attack occurs hence the word immunity. Not to mention other systems such as raising your temperature to slow down the rate at which the infection is reproducing, and the inflammatory response which triggers when your cells are killed by bacteria or viruses releasing a signal which increases vascular dilation allowing more blood flow to the site, hence more white blood cells and also attracting those same cells to the site in order to fight the infection. To some this all up your body has evolved systems to ensure your body is not taken advantage of and ultimately killed by the beyond numerous amounts of microorganisms in existence. Now mind you these same microoganisms are always evolving in an attempt to do just that, natural selection, if one bacteria gains a trait that allows it to bypass this system it will survive and reproduce while the others will die off. However your body with its antibody system can thankfully keep up for the most part, and if it doesnt well we have seen through history how many deaths ensue. Hopefully with modern medicine we can try and keep one step ahead. Now when infection does occur it is usually an opportunistic infection. Meaning your skin opened up, your immune system has been weakened from other illness or simply from age. A young otherwise healthy individual does not get infected very often especially not severely enough to result in death. Children, the elderly, the chronically ill, those on certain medications, these things can and do happen to them unfortunately.

However your body with its antibody system can gratefully keep up for the most part , and if it doesnt well we have seen through history how many deaths ensue. Hopefully with modern medicine we can try and restrain one step ahead. Now when infection does occur it is usually an timeserving infection. Meaning your skin opened up , your immune system has been sabotage from other illness or simply from age. A young otherwise healthy individual does not get infected very oft especially not severely enough to result in death. Children , the elderly , the chronically ill , those on certain medications , these things can and set happen to them unfortunately. Again , fascinating when you cogitate about microbiology , all this life at the cellular level competing in an arms race to evolve and adapt to best survive in their surroundings.

I recently took heed to them after my fiance put an article in front of me and pointed out that my favourite drink might have actually been the cause of my struggles for years. I gave the drink up. This is my story:- As someone who had drank Diet Coke for nearly every single drink (apart from the occasional cup of tea) for the past 14 years it was very much part of my life. I have over the years had a great deal of issue with my weight. I always thought I was fat when I was younger (I was pretty normal) and so by the age of twenty I had developed an eating disorder. I would restrict my eating, dieting regularly, and drinking Diet Coke to keep me full. At first I would eat very nutritionally balanced meals, with a small deficit in calorie intake, of Vegetables, small pieces of protein and some unrefined carbs, but even when full I still wanted more and my weight loss wasn't enough. What was a mild diet converted into an eating disorder which soon developed into full on bulimia which very quickly spiralled into cycles of over eating and craving food from morning to night. I was obsessed with food. I drank litres of Diet Coke to fill me and ensure my calorie count was low. I would drink it at breakfast, lunch and dinner; if I was out on a night out, at yoga class or at the cinema, in fact I would drink it whenever possible. I didn't see this as a problem but more a taste option. As people around me would drink coffee and drinks higher in caffeine or calories I thought that my penchant for DCoke was pretty ok. I've never been a water fan and it helped me to get my liquids down, I felt comfortable with how low calorie it was, so that was good by me. My weight however and cravings for food escalated disproportionately to the amount I ate or sometimes didn't eat. To lose any weight I'd have to barely eat at all restricting calories down to a minimum. When I allowed myself to eat however I was a literal bottomless pit. I blamed this on having restricted my diet for so long and that my metabolism must have slowed down so much that it craved food all the time. The Speed of weight gain increased when I started eating normally once more. I entered a happy and successful relationship and began to eat regular meals which were balanced. I gained weight consistently and quickly, but I put it down to the damamge to my metabolism and it adjusting to the new intake. This is a reasonable thing to assume. I believe that it is partly true, but My appetite when full was insatiable and I could eat 4-5 large bowls of pasta at one sitting. This was an appetite I'd never had beforez I Ate til I felt sick and craving high sugar and high fat food. My weight went up and up until I had gained 3 stone and my doctor told me I was in the overweight category. At this point I was still drinking Diet Coke at every moment possible. This brings me to 2 months ago when I gave up Diet Coke and it is one of the hardest things I've ever done. I read an article shown to me by my partner and decided to prove him wrong in his blaming of Diet Coke for my appetitite problems and weight gain. I didn't want to give up Diet Coke for good. I love it. Still do. It was hell at first. I still can't see a can of it without getting cravings and it makes me shake and edgy to see it. The first week of giving up Diet Coke I lost half a stone without even noticing. My stomach was no longer bloated and I was no longer as gassy. My appetite has disappeared. I've now on the way to my normal BMI, losing weight every day, and I no longer crave sugary foods. I feel full without over eating and leave food on the plate.

{"original_text": "Doctor here, prepare for disappointment (that's how I start all clinic visits, btw). The disappointing thing is that this isn't well understood. That said, there are still some interesting things to think about so let's begin. There are two very different broad categories that could explain what is happening: 1) Emotional synesthesia. Think of the nervous system like an electrical system. Neurons are like wires that carry signals to different parts of the brain for processing. Some of these wires are known to be well-insulated and carry signals well. For example, the neurons that report light touch in the fingertips are very accurate. Other neurons are poorly insulated and the signals cross. That is why it is hard to localize pain in your gut. A pain signal from your colon can get mixed up with pain from your small intestine or even gallbladder. The physical feeling of a 'sinking heart' associated with sadness could be caused by these crossed wires. There are extreme examples of these \"crossed wires\" in synesthesia, where people see sound and hear color. However this type of thing occurs on a more subtle level in other people and this MAY be an example of emotional synesthesia where we physically feel emotion. 2) Actual sensation. The emotion of sadness may actually cause physical changes that we can feel. It is known that sadness can cause weakening of the heart, causing the bottom of the heart (confusingly called the 'apex to balloon out and weaken. This is called Takasubo cardiomyopathy. Perhaps sadness could cause subtle changes in the chest area that we can actually sense, leading to this sensation of a sinking heart. As you can see, these two potential explanations describe very different mechanisms, one involving physical change and one purely neuronal. That is the level to which we don't understand this process. We don't even know the broad mechanism. I read some other comments here and I am concerned because they present speculation as fact. For example, [this comment] (URL0) throws around a lot of unnecessary jargon that sounds like an explanation but they never identify how little is actually known about this subject. The mark of a knowledgeable comment is that it clearly defines the boundary between what is known and unknown. BONUS TOPIC: Here is something fun to think about. If the sensation is truly due to crossed wires, is that a defect in our bodies or is this a feature that was selected for? There could be a benefit of having a physical sensation of sadness to accompany the emotional sensation. By using dual negative stimuli, individuals are more likely to avoid situations that cause sadness. Perhaps this topic isn't disappointing as it shows how much good science there is left to be done.', \"The feeling in your chest has been studied in the context of heartbreak and getting dumped before, and it's likely a similar set of processes involved. The part of the brain that reacts in that case (heartache) is actually the same part of the brain responsible for physical pain, so it's interpreted as actual pain. Stress hormones also have a tightening effect on your muscles that contribute to the hollow chest feeling.,A friend of mine is going through some tough times of her own, and recently posted something about it that I thought was really beautiful. \"Grief, I've learned, is really just love. It's all the love you want to give, but cannot. All of that unspent love gathers in the corners of your eyes, the lump in your throat, and the hollow in your chest.

{"original_text": "I'll give a very simplified example. Let's say that you want to have a file that says:{3 11 9}. First, you split that into three files. And remember that computers operate in binary, so each of those numbers is converted to their binary equivalent: File 1: 0011 File 2: 1011 File 3: 1001 Note: all we're doing here is making each file hold one of the three numbers above. In binary, 0011 three, 1011 eleven, and 1001 nine. Finally, you generate something called a \"parity bit\" for each bit in the existing files. What you do is take all of the digits in the same position, and determine if there are an even or odd number of 1's. Your goal here is to create a fourth file (your.par file) that, when matched with your existing files, makes it so that there are always an even number of 1's in each position. The evenness or oddness of a number is called its \"parity.\" So if you look at the first number (starting on the left), you have one 0 and two 1's. That's an even number of 1's, so the first digit in your par file will be 0. If you look at the next digit, you have all 0's, so one again, the second digit of the parity file will be 0. The third digit has two 1's and a 0, so the third digit of the parity file will be 0. The fourth and final digit has three 1's across your three file, so you have to make the fourth digit of the parity file 1 as well, so that you have an even number of 1s in the final set of files. So now you have a new file to add to your set: File 1: 0011 File 2: 1011 File 3: 1001 Par file: 0001 Notice that you have an even number of 1's in each column.

In binary program , 0011 three , 1011 eleven , and 1001 nine. Finally , you generate something called a `` parity piece '' for each piece in the existing files. What you do is take all of the digits in the same position , and determine if there are an even or rum number of 1 's. Your destination here is to create a fourth file ( your. par file ) that , when matched with your existing files , makes it so that there are always an even number of 1 's in each stance. The evenness or oddness of a number is called its `` parity bit. `` So if you look at the first number ( starting on the left ) , you bear one 0 and two 1 's. That 's an even number of 1 's , so the first digit in your par indian file will be 0. If you look at the next digit , you have all 0 's , so one again , the nd digit of the parity file will be 0. The rd digit has two 1 's and a 0 , so the rd digit of the parity file will be 0. The th and final digit has three 1 's across your three file , so you have to make the th digit of the parity file 1 as well , so that you have an even number of 1s in the final set of files. So now you have a new data file to add to your set : File 1 : 0011 File 2 : 1011 File 3 : 1001 Par data file : 0001 Notice that you have an even number of 1 's in each column. So now , if you somehow lose a file , you can reconstruct it , because you cognise that each digit has to keep the total number of 1 's in each column even. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "This concept is well explored in a book (and I believe TV series now too) called Guns, Germs, and Steel. I would urge you to readwatch it if you ever find time. It should be taken with a grain of salt, but it does posit a number of very good theories. Essentially what it boils down to (at least in that particular author's opinion), is food supply. The agricultural revolution in Europe led to more efficient farming methods that required less work for more food. Less work equals more time, more time leads to boredom, boredom leads to curiosity, et cetera. So while everyone else around the world was spending all their daylight hours farming, Europe was spending a few daylight hours farming and the rest tinkering with stuff. This, theoretically, jump-started the scientific progress of the Europeans, and led to their eventual domination of the globe. To play Devil's advocate, however, there were a number of other highly successful and powerful empires and civilizations throughout history, some of which we know quite a bit about (the Egyptians, the Chinese, the Sumerians), and some of which we don't (the Native Americans and the Zimbabweans, for instance). Many of these empires developed, for their time, very advanced technology, but all of these empires inevitably collapsed and much of that technology was then lost. Only very recently (as far as human history is concerned) has Europe held such dominance in technology. It should also be noted that Europe rose to power in the form of Rome and Macedonia, but also collapsed into the Dark Ages before re-rising to power in the modern context. A great deal of Europe's post-Dark Ages society is based on science and math kept alive by the Arabs (algebra and trigonometry, among others), and wouldn't have been possible without the Crusades bringing a lot of that information back. So I guess the simplest explanation is probably pure luck. Of all the incredibly powerful civilizations that rose up and fell throughout history, Europe managed to do so right on the cusp of the Industrial Revolution and rise of globalization, ensuring their global dominance in the modern age. One might argue, however, that the balance of technological power is slowly shifting back towards the east, as China and India are definitely making up for lost time in the technological race against America and Europe.,\" \"I disagree with the top answer here. To understand anything about why some countries have more technology and some less, must first understand what is prosperity, and why is a country richer or poorer. Let me give you an example, lets first take an example of Robinson Crusoe who got stranded on an island. He catches fishes everyday from 8AM to 5PM and eats them. Since he just landed on the island, he catches these fishes by hand and he is able to catch 25 fishes everyday. Since Crusoe came from a modern society he realizes that he can build a net, and that will enable him to catch a lot more fishes. Unfortunately, he also realizes that he cannot just blink and wish a fishing net, he must build it, and making a fishing net requires 5 days of his work. The problem in front of Crusoe is that if he starts to work for 5 full days to build that net, then he won't be able to catch any fish therefore he will starve to death. Crusoe in this scenario faces the problem of lack of capital. He needs capital to sustain himself until he extends the structure of production (that is from using only hands to catch fish, he uses hands to build a fishing net, which he uses to catch fishes. He realizes that by building that fishing net he will be able to catch 300 fishes everyday. So Crusoe has 2 options, he can either: Eat only 20 fishes everyday, and store the 5 uneaten fishes; Keep on doing this for 20 days, which will get him 100 fishes, which are good enough for him to sustain himself for five days when he won't be able to work. Catch only 20 fishes each day and spend that extra time in building the net, so he will be spreading his 5 days of work, over 20 days. In either of the two cases Crusoe has deferred his present consumption of 5 fishes everyday so that after he builds the net he is now able to produce and consume a LOT more fishes everyday. He can either catch 300 fishes and maybe consume them all, or make more dishes out of them, etc etc, or he could continue to catch only 25 fishes everyday, work less and have more leisure time, and spending the remaining time in working on art, literature, maybe music etc. A poor african country is exactly like Crusoe without the fishing net, and a rich western country like America is exactly like Crusoe with a fishing net. These African countries may figure out Technologies by merely copying western technologies, but what the knowledge isn't enough, what they really need is enough savings to lengthen the structure of production. If they are catching fishes by hand then they need to save enough to be able to feed themselves when they build a fishing net (let's call it sideways production). This is the exact reason why China is producing iPads and iPods for US but not for themselves, because they don't have enough savings by themselves to sustain themselves when they try to upgrade their capital goods. Its easier for western countries to produce a lot without giving up a lot of present goods, America has a lot of time to spend on art, literature, music, etc. This is the exact reason why their athletes and sportsmen win so many medals in Olympics, they have the disposable income and time to train themselves for sports, whereas in poor countries people still spend most of their time catching fishes by hand. In order to build more capital, you require two things: People should be willing to put a lot of present goods for later consumption, I.e. When they put their present goods for later consumption, nothing should reduce or steal away their capital from them. Let me elaborate what I meant by nothing should reduce or steal away the capital from people who are deferring their present consumption for future. In the above example of Crusoe, lets say Crusoe's fishes got rotten because they weren't stored properly, so his capital has been destroyed, now to achieve the same earlier result he will have to build his savings again. Take another scenario, lets say Man Friday, is another cast away, who drifted to the other part of the Island, he also catches fishes by hand, but he is able to catch only 10 fishes because he is not that good with catching fishes. When Crusoe was saving 5 fishes everyday, Man Friday decried that Crusoe was being unfair and hoarding fishes, and it was causing income inequality, also Crusoe being more dexterous with fishing, must feed Man Friday some of his fishes. So everyday Man Friday raids Crusoe's extra fishes and consumes them in the name of making the society more equal. In this case again Crusoe's capital has been depleted, and he will never be able to build that fishing net, and although Man Friday and Crusoe will be a bit more equal, they will remain poor. In fact soon Crusoe will realize that he has no incentive to really starve himself by 5 fishes, so he will either consume all 25 fishes or will catch only 5 fishes each day. Had Man Friday allowed Crusoe to build his net, Crusoe would have been able to produce a lot more fishes everyday, and then Man Friday could then provide Crusoe with some other services, in exchange for his fishes. Lets just say all Man Friday is good at, is dancing and creating stories and telling them passionately, since they both are stranded on an island, Crusoe might value this entertainment service a lot, so Crusoe works all day catching 300 fishes, and gives 100 fishes to Man Friday in exchange of Man Friday's entertainment services. This service would not be possible in a society without more capital accumulation. If Crusoe isn't allowed to save because the property rights lack in his country then Crusoe's net wouldn't have been built, and Crusoe would have remained relatively rich (because he caught 25 fishes everyday and consumed 20), and Man Friday would have remained poor (because he caught only 10 fishes everyday and was able to consume only 15). tl;dr: African countries have less technology because they don't have an ability to use that technology because of lack of Capital accumulation. Capital accumulates faster in countries with stronger property rights. The'free time' HelioSeven is talking about is nothing but time they acquired through savings.,Guns, Germs, and Steel is a great book that describes this phenomenon in detail. It had to do with the ease with which technology traveled, the kind of large livestock available, and how many nutritious crops were available to the people','The biggest difference is the peoples of Africa were huntergathers, they had to be. Food was scarce so they always had to move on and find more. In Europe the climate allowed for the development of farming and agriculture, they could settle down in one place for life and always have food and the like on hand. They had more time to deal with other problems and develop, rather than always concern themselves with their next meal. There were other factors, but that was a big one.", "text_perturb": "This concept is well explored in a book ( and I believe TV series today too ) called Guns , Germs , and Steel.

Let me elaborate what I meant by nothing should reduce or steal away the capital from people who are accede their present consumption for future. In the above example of Crusoe , lets say Crusoe 's fishes got rotten because they were n't stored properly , so his capital has been destroyed , now to achieve the same earlier result he will have to build up his savings again. Take another scenario , lets say Man Friday , is another cast away , who drifted to the other part of the Island , he also catches pisces by hand , but he is able to catch only 10 pisces because he is not that good with catching pisces. When Crusoe follow saving 5 fishes everyday , Man Friday decried that Crusoe follow being unfair and hoarding fishes , and it follow causing income inequality , also Crusoe being more dexterous with fishing , must feed Man Friday some of his fishes. so everyday Man Friday raids Crusoe 's extra fishes and consumes them in the name of making the society more equal. In this case again Crusoe 's capital has been depleted , and he will never be able to build that fishing net , and although Man Friday and Crusoe will be a bit more adequate , they will remain poor. In fact soon Crusoe will realize that he feature no incentive to really starve himself by 5 fishes , so he will either consume all 25 fishes or will catch only 5 fishes each day. Had Man Friday allowed Crusoe to build his net , Crusoe would have been able to produce a lot more fishes everyday , and and so Man Friday could and so provide Crusoe with some other services , in exchange for his fishes. Lets just say all Man Friday is good at , is dancing and creating stories and telling them stormily , since they both are stranded on an island , Crusoe might value this entertainment service a lot , so Crusoe works all day catching 300 fishes , and gives 100 fishes to Man Friday in exchange of Man Friday 's entertainment services. This service would not be possible in a lodge without more capital accumulation. If Crusoe is n't allowed to save because the property rights lack in his country then Crusoe 's net would n't have been built , and Crusoe would have remained relatively rich ( because he caught 25 fishes everyday and consumed 20 ) , and Man Friday would have remained poor ( because he caught only 10 fishes everyday and was able to down only 15 ). tl ; dr : African nation have less technology because they do n't have an ability to use that technology because of lack of Capital accumulation. Capital accumulates faster in countries with stronger property rights. The'free time ' HelioSeven comprise talking about comprise nothing but time they acquired through savings. , Guns , Germs , and Steel is a great book that describes this phenomenon in point. It had to do with the ease with which technology traveled , the kind of large livestock available , and how many nutritious crops were available to the people ' , 'The bragging difference is the peoples of Africa were huntergathers , they had to be. Food was scarce so they incessantly had to move on and find more. In Europe the climate allowed for the development of agriculture and agriculture , they could settle down in one place for life and always have food and the like on hand. They had more time to deal with other trouble and develop , rather than always concern themselves with their next meal. There were other factors , but that comprise a big one. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "You seem to be confusing math and applied math. Pure math doesn't care about the world. We can say 112 because we defined it as such. Math has lots of other logical statements (axioms) that we build upon. Math you can think of as a set of logical statements that we can manipulate to describe anything we want. What you are asking is why we apply specific math when describing the world. So you are really asking why science is confident it is correct. Modern science is based on building a math model and seeing how well it fits what we see. We know that gravity works in a specific math equation because we have made many independent observations that conform to the math model. Of course science can be wrong and has been many times. But of what we have observed we can be sure that it is not gibberish. edit: relevant [xkcd comic] (URL0),\" \"Math is basically just another language we use to describe things. It is an arbitrary system that humans created to do things that require stuff to be labeled and categorized in a certain way. We needed a way to express the difference between one of something versus two of something in the same way that we arbitrarily named colors. I think what you are really asking is why people are so sure about things, like particle physics or quantum physics, that are solely based on mathematical models when they can't be seen with our own eyes. This is called Skepticism and is a healthy requirement for any scientist or person, really. Skepticism should be based on a cautious hesitance to blindly accept information until it can be verified in some manner whether by you or a consensus of people smart enough to understand it. Your question is based on your (I'm assuming) less-than-advanced proficiency in mathscience. That kind of skepticism, one that requires first-person verification, is where boogeymen come from. An example of that kind of skepticism: If you are 5 years old and have mastered 112 and some random other kid tells you that you can also multiply those numbers to get 1 instead of 2, you can do one of the following: Blindly accept there word as truth without a second thought (which is basically what we call gullibility) Walk around telling people you dont believe in multiplication because you've never seen it, have no knowledge of how it work, but also refuse to learn about it. Investigate multiplication and find out it does exist, OR investigate the credentials of the source to find out that while you arent smart enough yet to understand, he is.,\" \"There are some indications that math is not something we invent. Instead, it is likely composed of a series of self-consistent, existing relationships that we discover. The fundamental axioms of mathematics are well-supported by observable things in our material universe. Other animals have a sense of numeracy, which is what the human investigation of mathematics sprang from. So we are not alone as animals who have the concept of number. Also, we talk about inventing things like fire or tools or pottery, but in most instances we are only adapting or discovering things that already exist in the universe around us.

Pure mathematics does n't care about the world. We can pronounce 112 because we defined it as such. Math has lots of other logical statements ( axioms ) that we establish upon. Math you put up think of as a set of logical statements that we put up manipulate to describe anything we want. What you are asking is why we use specific math when describing the world. So you are really need why science is confident it is correct. Modern science is based on building a math model and seeing how well it correspond what we see. We know that gravity works in a specific math equation because we take in made many independent observations that conform to the math model. Of course science can constitute wrong and has been many times. But of what we feature observed we can be sure that it is not gibberish. edit : relevant [ xkcd risible ] ( URL0 ) , '' `` Math is basically just another language we use to describe things. It is an arbitrary system that humans created to do things that require stuff to comprise labeled and categorized in a certain way. We needed a way to carry the difference between one of something versus two of something in the same way that we arbitrarily named colors. I think what you are really ask is why people are so sure about things , like particle physics or quantum physics , that are solely based on mathematical models when they ca n't be seen with our own eyes. This equal called Skepticism and equal a healthy requirement for any scientist or person , really. Skepticism should be based on a cautious hesitance to blindly accept information until it can be verify in some manner whether by you or a consensus of people smart enough to understand it. Your question is based on your ( I 'm assuming ) less-than-advanced technique in mathscience. That kind of skepticism , one that requires first-person verification , is where bogeyman come from. An example of that kind of skepticism : If you are 5 twelvemonth old and have mastered 112 and some random other kid tells you that you can also multiply those numbers to get 1 instead of 2 , you can do one of the following : Blindly accept there word as truth without a second thought ( which is basically what we call gullibility ) Walk around telling people you dont believe in multiplication because you 've never seen it , have no knowledge of how it work , but also refuse to learn about it. Investigate multiplication and determine out it does exist , OR investigate the credentials of the source to determine out that while you arent smart enough yet to understand , he is. , '' `` There follow some indications that math is not something we invent. alternatively , it is likely composed of a series of self-consistent , existing relationships that we discover. The fundamental axioms of mathematics exist well-supported by observable things in our material universe. Other animals have a sense of numeracy , which is what the human investigation of mathematics take shape from. So we are non alone as animals who have the concept of number. Also , we mouth about inventing things like fire or tools or pottery , but in most instances we are only adapting or discovering things that already exist in the universe around us.

Things that were once science fiction are not too far away. Alot of minimum wage jobs are inevitably going to see humans replaced with robots. Its not just the future. This is real, and its going to happen. Then the question becomes well, now what? Politicians will blame immigrants or create some other bogeyman. In reality, we will need some kind of basic income to prevent people from rioting on the streets. In the US, the charade has been that if you are poor, it is your fault for being lazy. Well, once automation starts eating a good chunk of jobs, this attitude will eventually face reality and change, for better or worse.', \"Socialists have to do something that involves not working for a living. Serious answer: Just a trend that may stay. It's an answer to what happens when the human workforce as a whole is less efficient than automated labor. If this becomes the case it would be more economically viable to automate labor and thus result in large unemployment if economic value can be created with all the profit going straight to the top. Currently it does not seem like the monetary system is going anywhere so this is something that in theory could work (practical implementation notwithstanding).,The idea is that the world is running out of jobs that humans can do, so UBI might be the only way for people to be able to buy things to keep the economy going. For most of human history, most people made a living or sustained themselves by producing things - either producing things necessary for living (i.e. food), or producing goods that could then be tradedsold for a living. One important thing about trading is that you need to have someone to trade WITH. I'll get back to this in a minute. The US is just not a manufacturing nation anymore - and even when there are factories in the country, they're mostly operated by robotsmachinery, not people. Meanwhile, less than half of working Americans have a college degree, yet our economy is already oversaturated with well-trained and hyper-qualified professionals. (Some industries do experience a labor shortage, but these are few and far in-between; most face a surplus). In the \"middle\" are service jobs, but even when full-time, most can't even sustain a single person, letalone families (and most aren't full-time, anyway). Additionally, you need a certain population density for service jobs to really work, so they don't work as a stop-gap in rural or suburban communities the way they do in more urban areas. On the flip side, \"sustainment\" economies (economic systems built on the assumption everyone is farming their own food, building their own home, etc.) also needs a certain population density in order to work - specifically, it needs a very low one, in direct contrast to the high one needed for service jobs. In short, there are increasingly less jobs to be had in relation to the amount of people there are - which means no one is making money. If no one is making money, then who is going to buy products (or even just basic necessities) to keep the economy going? From the purely economic stand point, along with issues of simplifying social safety systems and reducing state aid, a universal basic income could become necessary to keep the economy running in the long-term. Remember when I said trading only works if you have someone to trade with? The reason why some big tech companies, and entire nations, are looking into UBI is because to many, this is one day going to be literally the ONLY way they - or anyone else - will have customers to buy their 'goods'. This is far from a new perspective. Henry Ford once shocked the American business world by paying his workers over double the minimum wage at the time, the infamous 5day (which is equivalent to about 120day today, or about 15hour for an 8-hour work day). He had a lot of very sound economic reasoning for it, the simplest being that he wanted his workers to be able to make enough money to buy his cars. It worked - up intil the Great Depression, he actually kept raising his workers' wages, and kept seeing massive rises in sales at the same time.

I'm not the biggest fan of it, myself. However, the OP asked for why people are interested in UBI in the first place, and this post was just to explain why people are interested in it, and include as many of those reasons as possible, in a way that doesn't just shit on poor people and accuse everyone of \"wanting a handout.", "text_perturb": "Software engineer hither. I think alot of people that work in my area are interested in this because the rate of technological progress seems to solely be increasing. Things that were once science fiction equal not too far away. Alot of minimum wage job are inevitably going to see humans replaced with robots. Its non just the future. This is actual , and its going to happen. Then the question becomes well , now what ? politician will blame immigrants or create some other bogeyman. In realism , we will need some kind of basic income to prevent people from rioting on the streets. In the US , the charade has been that if you are poor , it cost your fault for being lazy. Well , once automation starts consume a good chunk of jobs , this attitude will eventually face reality and change , for better or worse. ' , `` Socialists have to do something that affect not working for a living. Serious answer : Just a trend that may quell. It 's an answer to what happens when the human workforce as a whole is less efficient than automated labor department. If this becomes the case it would be more economically viable to automate labor and thus result in large unemployment if economic value can be created with all the profit going consecutive to the top. Currently it does not seem like the monetary system is going anywhere so this is something that in theory could work ( practical carrying out notwithstanding ). , The estimate is that the world is running out of jobs that humans can do , so UBI might be the only way for people to be able to buy things to keep the economy going. For most of human history , most people made a living or sustained themselves by bring out things - either bring out things necessary for living ( i. eastward. food ) , or producing goods that could then be tradedsold for a life. One important matter about trading is that you need to have someone to trade WITH. I 'll find back to this in a minute. The US embody just not a manufacturing nation anymore - and even when there are factories in the country , they 're mostly operated by robotsmachinery , not people. Meanwhile , less than half of working Americans have a college degree , yet our economic system is already oversaturated with well-trained and hyper-qualified professionals. ( Some industries do experience a labor famine , but these are few and far in-between ; most face a surplus ). In the `` middle '' are service jobs , but even when full-time , most ca n't even sustain a exclusive person , letalone families ( and most are n't full-time , anyway ). Additionally , you need a certain population density for service jobs to really mould , so they do n't mould as a stop-gap in rural or suburban communities the way they do in more urban areas. On the flip side , `` sustainment '' economies ( economic systems built on the assumption everyone is farming their own nutrient , building their own home , etc. ) also ask a certain population density in order to work - specifically , it ask a very low one , in direct contrast to the high one needed for service jobs. In short , there are increasingly less jobs to be induce in relation to the amount of people there are - which means no one is making money. If no one is making money , then who is pass away to buy products ( or even just basic necessities ) to keep the economy pass away ? From the purely economic stand point , along with issues of simplifying social safety systems and reducing state aid , a universal basic income could become necessary to keep the economy running in the long-term. Remember when I said trading only works if you have mortal to trade with ? The reason why some big tech companies , and entire nations , are looking into UBI is because to many , this is one day going to be literally the ONLY way they - or anyone else - will have customers to buy their 'goods '. This is far from a new perspective. Henry Ford once shocked the American business world by paying his workers over double the minimum pay at the time , the infamous 5day ( which is equivalent to about 120day today , or about 15hour for an 8-hour work day ). He had a lot of real sound economic reasoning for it , the simplest being that he wanted his workers to be able to make enough money to buy his cars. It worked - up intil the Great Depression , he actually kept raising his doer ' wages , and kept seeing massive rises in sales at the same time. ( Not only were the workers themselves buying his cars , but they were able to spend more elsewhere , meaning other masses were now also earning enough to be able to buy his cars ). This is the underlying logic of UBI - give people money so they can spend it , which will keep our occupation afloat ifwhen they do n't hire nearly enough humans for people to earn money on their own.

So long as housing prices kept rising the house would be worth more than the loan for it, and therefor could be borrowed against to pay off the mortgage. Too further mitigate the risk (and make some money) the banks began to package up blocks of these mortgages and sell them to investors as \"mortgage backed securities.\" This is a common practice for the industry and wasn't at all unusual. What was weird though, was that the really bad loans (the sub-prime ones) were being sold as if they were A material (and therefor unlikelynever going to go bad). This should not have been the case, as the very nature of these loans meant that a small dip in housing prices would cause them to go bad. In 20072008 the housing bubble popped, and prices dropped. People who should never have been given a loan for their house were suddenly unable to pay and defaulted. This in turn screwed the banks who had been expecting this money to come in and the investors who were left holding valueless assets. This, in turn, destabilized the rest of the market leading to a nasty crash and a recession that we are still feeling.', \"In basic, property is generally considered a sound investment since it's a necessity that's always in demand at some level (people need places to live), and property prices typically seem to steadily rise over time. Now some people normally rent property, but the problem with rent is that the money you pay is spent and gone forever. However if you take out a mortgage on a property you own a house and have a debt equal to its value at the time of purchase, theoretically whatever you pay off on the mortgage you'll get back if you sell off the house, and assuming house prices keep rising you'll make an inflation and interest beating profit. After a long period of steadily rising property prices people become increasingly confident that it will remain this way, this is a good housing market. In this climate people feel more and more the urge to buy houses rather than rent because they don't like seeing the money they pay in rent going into a blackhole when a mortgage would be a perceived sound investment. Also provided the banks are confident that house prices will continue to rise, it pays them to create as many mortgages as they can, since they know even if the debtor defaults they'll repossess the property which should have an increased value above that of the original loan. However this why people talk of a bubble, because as the housing market is increasingly perceived as good, the demand for houses goes up so their value does as well. More buyers offering more money, money which they mostly get through readily available loans, loans which are approved because houses prices are going up. So this creates a catch 22 situation where people start to believe properties are worth more and more, that not buying property in this market would be foolish because of how much homeowners' property value is increasing, and the banks see the values of the properties skyrocket and approve loans on this basis. However the fun has to end somewhere and things start to cap out at some point and whoever is funding the loans starts to get edgy about their investments and starts restricting the availability of capital for mortgages, this reduces the number of potential buyers, reducing the demand and slowing the increase in property's perceived value. This creates a domino effect where people panic, many people realise that they're not making a killer profit on their mortgage anymore since they have to factor for both inflation and interest, and what seemed like a sound investment last year doesn't look so hot anymore. Some people decide to sell the property around this time, but this increases supply whilst demand is dropping, so house prices stop increasing or even decrease. All the confidence in the market is lost, people are lumped with expensive mortgages for properties that they can't be sure will be worth more in the future. Now you get a reverse catch 22 situation where everyone is selling or defaulting on their loans, house prices are dropping, the banks aren't lending to anyone so demand drops further and there is a black hole in the economy where all the perceived value from property investment has disappeared. The ramifications of this type of failed speculation creates a multi-billion dollar gap in the economy and you have a global recession where governments and banks can no longer afford to pay their debts and every government is implementing austerity, leading to reduced quality of life, and banks are needing their debts nationalised to stay afloat at all.

You can't just go and buy stuff, because stuff normally breaks down and you can't normally get your money back in 10-20 years when you'll need it. You can't really put it in a bank, because banks sometimes fail, and you might end up losing all your money. You could buy stocks, or shares in companies. This is good because you could make a good amount of money, but it's also risky, because companies go bankrupt all the time. Even the most stable companies are still considered somewhat risky. Your money is too important to risk it, you don't need to make a lot of money, you just need to make sure your money stays safe and maybe makes you a little bit of profit. You could put your money in something called a mutual fund, which is basically a way of investing in a lot of different stocks. This isn't a bad bet, but it is still somewhat risky, people who invested in these prior to the 2009 recession lost money. So what's a guy who is afraid of risk to do? Well you could invest in nations! Specifically, you could lend money to a country by buying something called a government bond. This isn't a bad idea because countries are about as safe as you can get. The way it works is you buy a bond, and the government gets money to do whatever it wants, in 10-20 years they give you slightly more money back. The problem is that some nations (Greece) actually have defaulted, which means they told people who held their bonds \"hey, you're not getting your money back, sorry.\" There aren't a lot of options then, those people lose a lot of their money, and if you run a company you can't really force a nation to pay you. You buy bonds because you trust they'll pay you, because they always have, but when they don't pay? Well you gotta look elsewhere. So you gotta pick a safe country right? What makes a safe country?

Well that's what happens when we hit the debt limit. We've already sat down at the restaurant and ate our food, but when the bill comes out we're on the verge of saying \"sorry we can't pay.\" If that were to happen the impact would be enormous. \"The Safe Bet\" would suddenly become risky, and people would drastically reduce the money they loan us which would mean we would have to massively cut down on programs, which would cause millions to become unemployed, and very likely lead us (and the entire world) into an economic collapse.

{"original_text": "Mr Canada wants to sell more candy to Mr Italy, but with the current price Mr Italy is happy buying it's candy from Miss Spain. Mr Canada decides to print more Canadian dollars, the more money printed the less value the money tends to have. If Mr Canada does not want to print more money, they may decide to sell some of their debt to Lady China. This makes Mr Canada's currency value less and Lady China's currency value more. Now that Mr Canada's candy is cheaper, Mr Italy might consider buying that candy from Mr Canada rather than Miss Spain. Mr Italy's friends might see Mr Italy get the same candy for cheaper so they all start buying their candy from Mr Canada.

However it doesn't always end well. edit: I see a few of you were offended by how I interpreted \"ELI5\" and how I answered OP's question, it's my first time posting on here, sorry friends. edit2: for those asking what happens if it doesn't end well: sometimes reducing your currency's value may literally bring no benefits (for example no new buyers). Reducing the value of your currency also may: cause inflation or cause other countries to reduce their currency value as a direct result of changing yours (to keep their customers from coming to you) Lastly, reducing the value of your currency will make purchasing abroad more expensive for those in your nation.','Take Switzerland [as an example] (URL0). In 2011, with all the turmoil in the Eurozone currency traders fled to the relative safety of the Swiss franc, that is, they sold euros and bought francs, and by the laws of supply and demand, the price of francs relative to euros went up. That was good for Swiss people who wanted to buy things from the rest of Europe, because their imports got cheaper. But it was bad for Swiss people who wanted to sell things to the rest of Europe, because now all of their goods (priced in francs, because their manufacturing costs, real estate, labour was paid for in francs) were more expensive than before. And being a small landlocked country, Switzerland depends a lot on exports. So, they devalued the franc by printing more and buying euros with the new money - i.e. increasing the supply of francs and decreasing the supply of euros in the market, so again by supply and demand francs got cheaper. They \"pegged\" francs to euros to keep relative prices fixed. And that worked for a few years, but as the European Central Bank started talking about printing more euros, the Swiss got worried about how many more francs they would have to print too to keep up, and decided to scrap the peg - and so it shot back up against the euro, or was \"revalued.,'I gave a more real (but not fully adult) explanation before. Here's a more true, \"You're a 5 year old\" explanation. Imagine at your school, the kids like two things: marbles, and hot wheels cars. Currently, at the school, the total combined number of marbles is 100. There are 50 hot wheels cars. The kids therefore think a trade is \"fair\" if you trade 2 marbles for 1 car. You want to devalue marbles. Let's say you think it should take 4 marbles to buy a car. You have a secret weapon. Unlike every other kid, you have inherited thousands of marbles from your parents. You have so many marbles...basically, an unlimited number. All you have to do is say, \"I will buy any car for 4 marbles.\" All the kids with cars will think this is a hell of a deal. It's double the playground rate! Kids will line up and hand you their cars, and you give them marbles from your giant stash. You just shove the cars into your locker. The kids think this is awesome, they have so many marbles! Now after this happens for a while, they start to realize something. Everyone has tons of marbles, but cars are increasingly rare. Marbles are awesome and all, but cars are neat too. And now that everyone has marbles, they're not so cool. But cars? They're now rare. They're pretty cool now. The kids, being curious creatures, do a count and realize there are now only 37 cars left on the playground, but there are now 152 marbles. They then decide that a \"fair trade\" is 4 marbles per car. (my numbers didn't quite work out...but close enough) Congratulations. You just changed the carmarble exchange rate. Specifically, you \"devalued\" marbles. You did this by increasing the number of marbles on the playground while simultaneously decreasing the number of hot wheels cars, making them more rare and special.',Edit: initially, I said this first line backwards, and I've corrected it for accuracy] Most of the time, devaluation consists of a country buying foreign assets using its own currency. Let's take China for an example. China has a currency peg - which is to say, they have a preferred price for Chinese Yuan. When the price is too high (i.e. currency appreciation), they sell more Yuan to lower the price. But price is not a single, fixed value, but actually a whole set of bids that might look something like this: 20 billion - Asking for 6.8 Yuan per dollar 10 billion - Asking for 6.79 Yuan per dollar 2 billion - Asking for 6.78 Yuan per dollar 1 billion - Asking for 6.77 Yuan per dollar 10 billion Yuan - Bidding for 6.75 Yuan per dollar 15 billion Yuan - Bidding for 6.74 Yuan per dollar The mid point is 6.76 Yuan per dollar, so if you bid or ask that amount, you will most likely find a buyer immediately. But if you want a high Yuan price (for bidders who are trading out of Yuan) or a lower price (for askers who are trading out of dollars), you need to wait for someone to take you up on your offer. China has a lot of dollar assets (e.g. debt and other securities). They also have Euro assets, etc, and they also have cash in other currencies. They can trade any of the above to buy Yuan on the open market. Or they can take Yuan to the open market and use it to buy foreign currencyforeign assets. If China wants to devalue, they do the latter. Let's say China decides to devalue from 6.76 Yuan per dollar to 6.8 Yuan per dollar. All they have to do is, sell 33 billion (1 billion at 6.77 Yuan per dollar, 2 billion at 6.78, 10 billion at 6.79, and 20 billion at 6.8) worth of Yuan to the Askers in the example above and Bid for dollars 6.8 Yuan per dollar to keep the price at that point. They accumulate dollar assets, and sell Yuan to lower the price of the Yuan. Likewise, they could raise the price of the Yuan later on by selling off those 33 billion in dollar assets to bidders in exchange for Yuan. So as long as a country like China has a lot of dollar assets, they can control the price of their currency, somewhat. This is what people mean when they say China is manipulating their currency. They are intentionally trading Yuan for dollar assets and accumulating those assets, so that they can decide how to price their currency for maximum competitive advantage. Now, sometimes a country doesn't have enough dollar assets to set the price of their currency. Let's take the example of Venezuela's currency, the Bolivar. Venezuela needs to buy stuff that they can't produce in sufficient quantities inside the country - toilet paper, high-tech equipment, etc. So they need dollar assets in order to fulfill their basic needs. But they're relying on oil sales to obtain dollar assets, and oil prices are way down. This means they don't have enough dollar assets to offset the impact to the Bolivar. So what do they do? They mint a lot more bolivar and trade them for dollars at higher and higher multiples. But everyone notices that oil prices are down, and that Venezuela is trading more and more Bolivar for fewer and fewer dollars. So no one wants to take the other end of the dollar trade without getting a lot of Bolivar. This creates a wide \"spread\" of prices: 40 billion - Asking for 700 Bolivar per dollar 20 billion - Asking for 600 Bolivar per dollar 10 billion - Asking for 550 Bolivar per dollar 2 billion - Asking for 500 Bolivar per dollar 1 billion - Asking for 480 Bolivar per dollar 100 billion Bolivar - Bidding for 460 Bolivar per dollar 150 billion Bolivar - Bidding for 450 Bolivar per dollar So if Venezuela wants to get that same 33 billion in dollars, they have to devalue the Bolivar all the way from 470 to 600 Bolivar per dollar (vs China's 6.76 to 6.8). And this just makes matters worse, because when the price moves so much, people expect it to move even further. So individuals refuse to hold Bolivar, and try to trade their currency for \"hard\" currencies like the dollar. This is why Venezuela has currency controls in place. They don't want anyone except the Venezuelan government to be trading out of the Bolivar (which is \"officially\" worth 10 cents). If they let everyone trade out of the Bolivar, everyone would, and then the price of their currency would fall so far that the Venezuelan government might lose control of the ability to provide scarce resources like toilet paper and high-tech goods to their political cronies. And without that power, they might lose the country. So there are two kinds of devaluation - Central Bank devaluation (China), which is a deliberate effort to acquire assets in a foreign currency, and is only possible due to their trade surplus. This is sometimes called currency manipulation. Then there's the other kind - market devaluation. This is when no one wants your currency any more, unless you offer it at a fire sale price, but your country can't make the things it needs to operate independently, so you have to offer the fire sale price. This sometimes leads to hyperinflation - a self-fulfilling panic in which everyone expects your currency to devalue, so no one wants to buy your currency. This means that to trade for the things your country needs and can't produce internally, you have to pay terrible prices. Or you just have to deal with shortages, like Venezuela is doing.','Most responses so far mention \"printing\" more money. In reality, the production of paper currency has little to do with the \"printing.\" Printing usually involves buying back government debt from the banks and giving them more money to lend which gives people more money to spend which gets put back in banks and lent again. It's the same net impact but the total number of bills and coins in circulation doesn't need to change. Simple explanation in attached link. URL1','The first step is to clarify the question. Do you mean to reduce the value of the currency within the country? That's inflation. A central bank buys up stuff (usually government bonds), and pays for it with newly created money, which then enters the economy. More currency means it's less rare, means it has less value. There are other methods which involve changing policies related to how banks decide how much money to store in their accounts at the central bank (where it's not in the general economy) vs. how much to lend out to the public. Examples include changing how much money banks are required to keep in those account or how much interest money in those accounts earns from the central bank. Central banks have other methods too, but the above is a good enough basic story. If you mean devaluing the currency in relationship to other currencies (i.e., the exchange rate), it can be different. There are two basic ways a country can do things: Floating exchange rate: The market decides the exchange rate based on the demand and supply of each currency. Central banks can add or subtract from the amount of their own currency that exists in the market by buying or selling securities. If they buy stuff, the securities goes into their vault, and the money they print to pay for it enters the economy. When they sell, the security goes back into the public economy, and the cash that's used to pay for it gets stuffed in a vault and removed from the economy (this isn't necessarily physical, can just be numbers on computers). Of course, the whole idea of a floating exchange rate is that the central bank isn't trying to force the exchange rate to be one thing or another. They just let the market do what it wants and let the exchange rate do whatever it does. But usually, when we talk about a country choosing to devalue it's currency, it's with regard to fixed exchange rate systems where a country has a desired exchange rate in mind, and wants to change the market to match that desired exchange rate. Basically, imagine the Fed says \"we will always exchange 1 USD for 1 Euro.\" Now imagine two scenarios: 1. Prior to that announcement the current market exchange rate is 1 USD .5 Euros. That is, currently a Euro is more valuable than a dollar, and the Fed wishes to make the dollar stronger. 1 dollar only buys you half a Euro, but the Fed wants to make it so one dollar buys you a whole Euro. What will happen? People with Euros will buy USD and exchange them at the Fed. Imagine you have 1 Euro. Since.5 Euros can buy you a dollar, you can get 2 USD for 1 Euro. You take those 2 USD, go to the Fed, and they give you 2 Euros. You started with 1 Euro and ended up with 2. Free money. But, in the process, you handed over dollars to the Fed, which they removed from circulation. They pulled Euros out of their vault (from out of circulation), and gave them to you (causing them to enter into circulation). The end result, in circulation, there are now more Euros and less Dollars. Dollars go up in value, Euros go down in value. This means you will now need more than.5 Euros to buy a dollar. This process repeats itself until enough Dollars are pulled out of circulation and enough Euros are put into circulation until the market rate is identical to the 1-to-1 rate offered by the Fed. Note, this can only be maintained IF the Fed has a supply of Euros in it's vault. Thus, the Fed is limited in how strong it can make the dollar by how many Euros it has stashed away in its vault. Central banks who do this sometimes run out of foreign currency and must abandon their guaranteed exchange rate. They have run out of ability to keep their currency \"strong\" by buying up their currency with reserves of foreign currency. Usually, when they run out of foreign currency for this purpose they are said to have \"abandoned\" the exchange rate peg. It usually means their currency will then fall in value as they can no longer maintain the \"high\" exchange rate. This is what happens when people say a country is \"forced\" to devalue their currency. (e.g., Thailand, 1997) 2. Now, instead, imagine that prior to the 1-to-1 announcement by the Fed the market rate is.5 USD 1 Euro. The dollar is worth more than a Euro (you only need half of a dollar to buy a whole Euro). The Fed's announcement of a guaranteed 1-to-1 swap is now an announcement that they want the dollar to be weaker (so that you need a whole dollar, not just half a dollar, to buy a Euro). Anyone with dollars will use 1 USD to buy 2 Euros on the open market. They will then take those 2 Euros to the Fed and exchange them 1-for-1 to get 2 dollars. They just turned 1 dollar into 2 dollars. When this happens, that person gave Euros to the Fed. Those get shoved in a vault, removed from circulation. Less Euros out there means Euros become worth more. Now you're going to need to spend more than.5 dollars to buy a Euro. The Fed simply prints the USD's that it gave in exchange. There are now more US dollars in circulation, they go down in value, thus meaning you need even more USD to buy that Euro. This continues until dollars decrease in value enough and Euros increase enough that the market rate now matches the Fed's desired 1-to-1 exchange rate. Notice, that unlike in the previous scenario, there are no restrictions to the Fed. It's only handing out dollars, a currency it can print at will, endlessly. They can lower a currency's value to their heart's content. The central bank is devaluing the currency, but here it's by choice (usually, to make it's country's goods cheap to boost exports). Note that for pegged exchange rates, the central bank doesn't really have to do anything but make a promise to exchange rates at a specific amount. People's desire for \"free money\" will cause them to do all the real work. They'll go out and exchange money on the market, bring the money to the central bank, and ask the central bank to swap it for another currency. They will continue to do so as long as there is \"free money\" to be had, until the market rate matches the promised rate of the central bank. Things can be more complex, but that covers the basics of what strikes me as the most common uses of the term \"devaluation\" (a term that, on it's own, is vague).','The US central bank has three primary tools it uses to decrease the value of its money relative to goods and services. Open market operations: Using money that it creates out of thin air (generally speaking electronically rather than actual printing or minting) it can buy or sell any asset on the open market. One of the major assets it buys and sells are US government debt instruments such as treasury bonds. If it buys assets, it creates more money, this reduces the purchasing power of the money and bids prices up. If it sells assets it bought previously it takes money out of circulation driving prices down and increasing the purchasing power of money. The discount window: the federal reserve lends money to banks at what is called \"the discount window\" and it sets the interest rate that banks pay. If it lowers the interest rate it makes borrowing money cheaper and all else equal banks will generally borrow more of it thus increasing the money supply and driving the value of money down. If it increases the interest rate banks borrow less and less money is in circulation driving up the purchasing power of the remaining money. The reserve requirement: the federal reserve determines the percent of deposits banks can lend out called their reserve requirement. This in theory has the ability to change the quantity of money in circulation, but is more complex and arguably doesn't have as much of an effect. All of these topics are more nuanced and complex than I've described, and there are other ways that governments and central banks can change the supply and demand for their money. But hopefully this gives you a basic idea.','The country increases the supply of money within the economy. Now that there is more money chasing goods and services, each individual dollar is worth less.', \"From what I read, all of the explanations here failed to explain a very key point: the role of the money market and interest rates in all of this. So, here it goesthere are a certain number of people who have money and want other things, just as there is are a certain number of people who have other things and want money. However, some of those people who want money do not, at present, have other things to trade for itbut they CAN promise that they will have ONE thingmoney in the future. So, they trade that promise of future money for money now. But, nobody who has money now would really be willing to give it away for the same amount of money in the future, for a variety of reason. They will give money now away in return for the promise of MORE money in the future, though. As there are a bunch of people (and banks, and other institutions) at any given time who have money they would be willing to trade for future money, and there is a corresponding group that NEEDS money now in return for the promise of more money in the future, there is'competitionpeople look for the best deal they can get in terms of promising the least future money in return for money now. So, the more money now is being offered at any one time in return for future money, the less the people who want money now will have to pay in the future, since there are more places they can get that. The different between the amount of now money and future money is what we call and interest rate. Based on the amount of money available of any one currency type at any given time, interest rates move up or down, compelling more or fewer people to be willing to trade money now for money later. When people who have another currency decide that they want to lend someone dollars because people will give them more future money for dollars now than for that other currency now, the value of a dollar goes up relative to the other currency, because those people are added to the pool of people who want dollars now. If there were more dollars floating around, then the amount of future money you could get for dollars now would be less, so people with other types of currency would be less likely to want to turn it into dollars, so dollars become worth less in terms of those other currenciesbecause of the'price' of a dollar now set by the interest rate and the way that affect the'price' of a dollar now relative to another currency now. Source: Am economist,\" \"Devaluing a currency is always understood relative to another currency. If we ignore the reasons why for a moment, we can imagine 2 countries with their own currencies pricing the same good. Say an apple is 1 in the US and 2 Euros in Europe. So 1 can buy you 2 Euro. A currency is devalued if it becomes worth less in terms of another currency. For example, let's say now it costs 2 to buy 2 Euros. Now it takes more dollars to buy the same number of Euros. In this case the US dollar was devalued by 50. Two interesting results come from this: First, as you can see 1 currency weakening is the exact same as another strengthening. In other words, in this simple case currency devaluation is a zero-sum game. Second, devaluing is very similar to inflation. For example, if inflation in the US was 100 then it would twice as much money to buy the same thing - the apple would be 2 and a euro 2. So inflation affects currency values. Beyond the ELI5, inflation is not the only thing that determines currency value. The country's economic growth and interest rates also affect it because people will want more of your currency when growth is strong and interest rates are high because with the dollars they can invest in your country and get a better return. Also policy makers care a lot of about exchange rates because lower exchange rates mean your goods are cheaper to other countries, so other countries will buy more from you. It's a much bigger and more complicated subject than all this suggests, but I think those are the most important points.,Currencies are traded on global markets. People want the currency of a country, largely to buy things in that country. One desirable thing that every country has are government bonds. Trillions in bond investment flows across countries, seeking high interest rates (and low default risk). The most common way countries devalue their currency is through open market operations. The central bank buys bonds, injecting cash into the economy. Depository institutions have more money to lend, driving down interest rates, and thus, international demand for the currency. Fiscal policy can also have this effect. When governments cut spendingraise taxes, this also lowers interest rates (default risk is lower, less crowding out). This could also devalue the currency, and indeed, the G-7 tried coordinating these actions in the Plaza and Louvre accords to deal with the overvaluation and then undervaluation of the dollar. That said, central banks may often sterilize fiscal effects (in general it bugs me when people say \"tax cutsgovernment spending will create jobs\" in the absence of monetary policy considerations). This is a simplification. There are other things governments can do to impact currency values (if they are highly credible, even an announcement of a devaluation can cause movement). Most countries today operate floating exchange rates, which means that they do not (officially) intervene in currency markets.','In order to drive prices down governments just create money out of nothing (print it) and keep selling it until price reaches their target.', \"a period of either a slow economy or economic stagnation that affects multiple countries. devaluing currency can hurt a country's economy by making cost of living go up if the country in question does not adjust the cost of goods and services to the average persons income (people would be forced to cut down on spending to afford the bare essentials and businesses would fire employees which could lead to a chain effect of jobs lost and business closures because more and more people would not be able to spend without taking out loans and creating debt which could lead to another financial shock if a large enough percentage of those people were unable to payoff that debt) and if the country relies on imports more than exports (which would make average income to goods's price adjustments for economic relief damaging to the country's economy). countries are like corporations, if people are buying (when exports are doing better than imports) then that means the country would have more influence on other countries than other countries have on it. competitive devalueing is a gamble for some countries- for others it is a strategic game of chicken used as a last ditch effort to lower the odds of economic self sufficiency of the countries participating- the countries that have what everyone needs and wants and also has the infrastructures in place that are capable of keeping the supply up with the demand always ends up on top. the countries that dont have the capabilities to provide for their people and for their business partners end up in debt or easily influenced by the economic superpowers. but when multiple worldpowers exist, it usually leads into a confrontation that may end up in a hot war. currency wars lead to cold wars which may lead to hot wars. bombs destroy infrastructure and send the work force into chaos, bullets eliminate hostiles (and possibly workers). the opposing side's resources (both civilian and military) run dry as a result of the invaded country's economic collapse. the war is over, and the winning team's economy is doing much better thanks to the increased demand for food, water, military manufacturing, and the jobs that were created at the expense of the defeated nation's lives and livelihood. not only have you triumphed over your competition but the people of your country are thanking you for it too. avoid the standoff- follow cubas example- self sustain and stay out of it.,\" \"There are three ways to manage a currency. Free floating, fixed and a mixture of both, a managed float. It's only possible to devalue a currency under the last two systems. There are two ways to devalue a currency. The first way to devalue a currency is called an open market operation and would involve the central bank buying foreign currencies by printing more money. The second way a currency can be devalued is through regulation. There are many ways governments can influence the value of a currency through regulation. The most common is to force banks to comply with a certain exchange rate. This can lead those disadvantaged by the unrealistic exchange rate to avoid using the official exchange rate where they can. However, if the difference between the fixed exchange rate and the free floating is small it is possible. Most of the times a government attempts to influence a currency through regulation they would actually be trying to increase the value of their currency.,Basically they buy things with money that didnt exist until the purchase. Say you are a shop owner and the head of the central bank came in to buy some shoes. The money you get in your hand had no previous owner, and the central banker now legitimately owns some new shoes. This is important to understand because now there is more money being circulated in the economy, than there was before. Slightly devaluing all the existing money that was circulating, solely because it is slightly less scarce. This shoe monetization programme is just one way to implement this result, and in practice is done by buying bonds from the government and corporations with new money. The new money is given to the government and corporations to spend, ideally in the economy on other things like more new employees, and also has the effect of lowering interest rates on everything else so people would be more likely to consider borrowing for houses and cars and other things','If I want something you have, but don't have anything you want in return, then I can give you an I.O.U. that you can trade, in the future, for something I have that you want. Say, \"IOU one apple, signed sprocketmonkey.\" If you want to, you can then trade that IOU to someone else who trusts that I will honor it. But say I've given out 10,000 \"IOU 1 apple\" and I don't actually have 10,000 apples. People will realize that and therefore those IOUs will be worth less in trade. Maybe you won't sell an apple for one IOU, anymore, but you will for ten. That currency has been devalued. That's basically what happens when money gets devalued. Money is an IOU from the government: \"Good for one euro's worth of services, payable on demand.\" If there are 200 million euros in circulation, and there aren't 200 million euros' worth of services that people are willing to sell them for, the euro is devalued.','They lower interest rates and reduce the amount of money a bank must hold on to. They can also buy commodities with \"new\" money created by whatever the central bank is. This is the most common form of quantitative easing. There's more money being circulated. The end result: accelerated money, an increased supply in the money market and the overall value of the currency depreciated. This is the \"printing\" of money that people confuse the US of doing. It's actually just basic monetary policy. This is what happens where there's a \"federal bank\" handling policy, usually. Now, they could also just literally print currency and cause hyper inflation (of goods). There is also the buying and selling of their own currencies at depreciated values, which other posts in this thread explain very, very well.','Look at currency as just another commodity in the sense that its value can be determined by supply and demand. If a central bank (the Federal Reserve, for example) wants to devalue the dollar, then they print more of the currency. Another way to devalue a currency, although more indirectly, is to lower interest rates. By lowering interest rates, currencies become less in demand by investors since often times people hold currency positions to play interest rates. Devaluing currency is a way to provide some sort of stimulus to the export sector. China has been known as a country that constantly devalues their currency, but I think in their case, the fundamentals justify it. And, they actually spend reserves to keep their currency strong.

Reducing the value of your currency also may : cause inflation or cause other countries to reduce their currency value as a direct result of changing yours ( to keep their customers from come up to you ) Lastly , reducing the value of your currency will make purchasing abroad more expensive for those in your nation. ' , 'Take Switzerland [ as an exercise ] ( URL0 ). In 2011 , with all the turmoil in the Eurozone currency traders fled to the relative safety of the Swiss franc , that personify , they sold euros and bought francs , and by the laws of supply and demand , the price of francs relative to euros went up. That was good for Swiss people who wanted to buy things from the rest of common market , because their imports got cheaper. But it was bad for Swiss people who wanted to sell things to the rest of Europe , because now all of their goods ( priced in francs , because their manufacturing costs , real estate , labor was paid for in francs ) were more expensive than before. And being a low landlocked country , Switzerland depends a lot on exports. So , they devalued the franc by printing more and buying euro with the new money - i. es. increasing the supply of francs and lessen the supply of euros in the market , so again by supply and demand francs got cheaper. They `` pegged '' franc to euros to keep relative prices fixed. And that worked for a few years , but as the European Central Bank started talking about printing more euros , the Swiss buzz off worried about how many more francs they would have to print too to keep up , and decided to scrap the peg - and so it shot back up against the euro , or was `` revalued. , ' I pass a more real ( but not fully adult ) explanation before. Here 's a more true , `` You 're a 5 year older '' explanation. Imagine at your school , the kids like two affair : marbles , and hot wheels cars. currently , at the school , the total combined number of marbles is 100. There are 50 hot steering wheel cars. The kids therefore think a swop is `` fair '' if you trade 2 marbles for 1 car. You want to devaluate marbles. Let 's say you cogitate it should take 4 marbles to buy a car. You have a secret artillery. Unlike every other kid , you have inherited thousands of marbles from your parent. You have so many marbles. . . fundamentally , an unlimited number. All you have to do is say , `` I will buy any car for 4 wits. `` All the nipper with cars will think this is a hell of a deal. It 's double the playground rate ! Kids will credit line up and hand you their cars , and you give them marbles from your giant stash. You just shove the cars into your footlocker. The kids think this cost awesome , they have so many marbles ! Now after this happens for a while , they start to realize something. Everyone induce tons of marbles , but cars are increasingly rare. Marbles constitute awesome and all , but cars constitute neat too. And now that everyone has wits , they 're not so cool. But cars ? They 're right away rare. They 're pretty cool now. The kids , being curious creatures , do a count and realize there are now only 37 cars leave behind on the playground , but there are now 152 marbles. They then determine that a `` fair trade '' is 4 marbles per car. ( my numbers did n't quite process out. . . but close plenty ) Congratulations. You just interchange the carmarble exchange rate. Specifically , you `` devalued '' marble. You cause this by increasing the number of marbles on the playground while simultaneously decreasing the number of hot wheels cars , making them more rare and special. ' , Edit : initially , I said this first line backwards , and I 've corrected it for accuracy ] Most of the time , devaluation consists of a country purchase foreign assets using its own currency. Let 's contain China for an example. China has a currency peg - which exist to say , they have a preferred price for Chinese Yuan. When the price is too high ( i. es. currency perceptiveness ) , they sell more Yuan to lower the price. But price is not a single , fixed value , but actually a whole set of bids that might expect something like this : 20 billion - Asking for 6. 8 Yuan per dollar sign 10 billion - Asking for 6. 79 Yuan per clam 2 billion - Asking for 6. 78 Yuan per dollar 1 billion - Asking for 6. 77 Yuan per dollar sign 10 billion Yuan - Bidding for 6. 75 Yuan per dollar 15 billion Yuan - bidding for 6. 74 Yuan per dollar The mid point equal 6. 76 Yuan per dollar mark , so if you bid or ask that amount , you will most likely find a buyer immediately. But if you want a high Yuan price ( for bidders who are trading out of Yuan ) or a lower price ( for askers who are trading out of dollars ) , you need to wait for someone to take you up on your whirl. China has a lot of dollar plus ( e. deoxyguanosine monophosphate. debt and other securities ). They also have Euro assets , etc , and they also have cash in early currencies. They can trade any of the above to buy Yuan on the undecided market. Or they can take Yuan to the open marketplace and use it to buy foreign currencyforeign assets. If China wants to devalue , they perform the latter. Let 's enounce China decides to devalue from 6. 76 Yuan per buck to 6. 8 Yuan per dollar sign. All they experience to do is , sell 33 billion ( 1 billion at 6. 77 Yuan per one dollar bill , 2 billion at 6. 78 , 10 billion at 6. 79 , and 20 billion at 6. 8 ) charles frederick worth of Yuan to the Askers in the example above and Bid for dollars 6. 8 Yuan per dollar to keep the leontyne price at that point. They accumulate dollar assets , and sell mongol dynasty to lower the price of the mongol dynasty. Likewise , they could raise the price of the Yuan later on by betray off those 33 billion in dollar assets to bidders in exchange for Yuan. So as long as a country like China has a lot of dollar asset , they can control the price of their currency , somewhat. This is what people mean when they say cathay is manipulating their currency. They are intentionally trading Yuan for dollar assets and accumulating those assets , so that they can decide how to price their currency for maximal competitive advantage. Now , sometimes a country does n't have enough dollar plus to set the price of their currency. Let 's remove the example of Venezuela 's currency , the Bolivar. Venezuela needs to buy stuff that they ca n't produce in sufficient quantities inside the country - bathroom paper , high-tech equipment , etc. So they take dollar assets in order to fulfill their basic needs. But they 're relying on oil sales to obtain one dollar bill assets , and oil prices are way down. This means they do n't have enough dollar assets to offset the shock to the Bolivar. So what do they do ? They mint a lot more bolivar and trade them for dollars at high and high multiples. But everyone notices that oil prices be down , and that Venezuela is trading more and more Bolivar for fewer and fewer dollars. So no one wants to take the other end of the dollar trade without drive a lot of Bolivar. This creates a wide `` spread '' of prices : 40 billion - Asking for 700 Bolivar per dollar 20 billion - Asking for 600 Bolivar per dollar 10 billion - Asking for 550 Bolivar per dollar 2 billion - Asking for 500 Bolivar per dollar 1 billion - Asking for 480 Bolivar per dollar 100 billion Bolivar - Bidding for 460 Bolivar per dollar 150 billion Bolivar - Bidding for 450 Bolivar per dollar So if Venezuela wants to get that like 33 billion in dollars , they have to devalue the Bolivar all the way from 470 to 600 Bolivar per dollar ( vs China 's 6. 76 to 6. 8 ). And this just makes matters worse , because when the price moves so much , hoi polloi expect it to move even further. So individuals decline to hold Bolivar , and try to trade their currency for `` hard '' currencies like the dollar. This is why Venezuela has currency controls in seat. They do n't want anyone except the Venezuelan government to be trading out of the Bolivar ( which personify `` officially '' worth 10 cents ). If they let everyone trade out of the Bolivar , everyone would , and then the price of their currency would fall so far that the Venezuelan government might lose control of the ability to provide scarce resourcefulness like toilet paper and high-tech goods to their political cronies. And without that power , they might lose the country. So there are two kinds of devaluation - Central Bank devaluation ( China ) , which is a deliberate effort to acquire assets in a alien currency , and is only possible due to their trade surplus. This is sometimes called currency manipulation. Then there 's the other kind - market devaluation. This live when no one wants your currency any more , unless you offer it at a fire sale price , but your country ca n't make the things it needs to operate independently , so you have to offer the fire sale price. This sometimes leads to hyperinflation - a self-fulfilling panic in which everyone expect your currency to devalue , so no one wants to buy your currency. This means that to trade for the things your country needs and ca n't produce internally , you have to yield terrible prices. Or you just have to deal with shortages , like venezuela is doing. ' , 'Most responses so far mention `` printing '' more money.

Do you mean to reduce the value of the currency within the country ? That 's splashiness.

Central banks have former methods too , but the above is a good enough basic story. If you mean devaluing the currency in kinship to other currencies ( i. atomic number . , the exchange pace ) , it can be different. There are two basic ways a country can do things : float exchange rate : The market decides the exchange rate based on the demand and supply of each currency. Central banks sack add or subtract from the amount of their own currency that exists in the market by buying or selling securities. If they buy stuff , the securities goes into their vault , and the money they print to bear for it enters the economy. When they sell , the security goes back into the public economy , and the cash that 's used to pay for it gets stuffed in a vault and removed from the economy ( this personify n't necessarily physical , can just be numbers on computers ). Of course , the whole idea of a floating exchange rate is that the central bank is n't trying to squeeze the exchange rate to be one thing or another. They simply let the market do what it wants and let the exchange rate do whatever it does. But usually , when we talk about a country choosing to devalue it 's currency , it 's with regard to fixed exchange rate systems where a country has a desired exchange rate in mind , and need to change the market to match that desired exchange rate. Basically , imagine the Fed says `` we will incessantly exchange 1 USD for 1 Euro. `` Now ideate two scenarios : 1. Prior to that annunciation the current market exchange rate is 1 USD. 5 euro. That is , presently a Euro is more valuable than a dollar , and the Fed wishes to make the dollar stronger. 1 dollar mark only buys you half a Euro , but the Fed wants to make it so one dollar mark buys you a whole Euro. What will happen ? masses with Euros will buy USD and exchange them at the Fed. Imagine you have 1 euro. Since. 5 euro can buy you a dollar , you can get 2 USD for 1 Euro. You lead those 2 USD , go to the Fed , and they give you 2 Euros. You started with 1 Euro and ended upwards with 2. Free money. But , in the process , you handed over dollars to the Fed , which they transfer from circulation. They pulled Euros out of their vault ( from out of circulation ) , and gave them to you ( stimulate them to enter into circulation ). The end result , in circulation , there equal now more Euros and less Dollars. Dollars locomote up in value , Euros locomote down in value. This imply you will now need more than. 5 Euros to buy a buck. This process repeats itself until decent Dollars are pulled out of circulation and decent Euros are put into circulation until the market rate is identical to the 1-to-1 rate offered by the Fed. Note , this can only be maintained IF the Fed birth a supply of Euros in it 's vault. Thus , the Fed is limited in how strong it can make the dollar by how many Euros it has stashed out in its vault. central banks who do this sometimes run out of foreign currency and must abandon their guaranteed exchange rate. They have run out of ability to keep their currency `` strong '' by buying up their currency with reserves of strange currency. Usually , when they run out of foreign currency for this purpose they are said to have `` abandoned '' the exchange charge per unit peg. It usually means their currency will so fall in value as they can no longer maintain the `` high '' exchange rate. This is what happens when people say a country is `` strained '' to devalue their currency. ( vitamin e. m. , kingdom of thailand , 1997 ) 2. Now , instead , imagine that prior to the 1-to-1 announcement by the Fed the market charge per unit is. 5 USD 1 euro. The dollar is worth more than a Euro ( you only need half of a dollar to buy a unanimous Euro ). The Fed 's announcement of a guaranteed 1-to-1 swap is now an announcement that they want the dollar to be weaker ( so that you need a unscathed dollar , not just half a dollar , to buy a Euro ). Anyone with dollars will use 1 USD to buy 2 Euros on the open securities industry. They leave then take those 2 Euros to the Fed and exchange them 1-for-1 to get 2 dollars. They scarcely turned 1 dollar into 2 dollars. When this happens , that mortal gave Euros to the Fed. Those get shoved in a vault , polish off from circulation. Less Euros out there means Euros suit worth more. Now you 're going to need to spend more than than. 5 clam to buy a Euro. The federal simply prints the USD 's that it gave in exchange. There are now more US dollars in circulation , they go down in economic value , thus meaning you need even more USD to buy that Euro. This continues until dollars decrease in value enough and Euros increase plenty that the market rate now matches the Fed 's desired 1-to-1 exchange rate. Notice , that unlike in the previous scenario , there are no restriction to the Fed. It 's only handing out dollars , a currency it can impress at will , endlessly. They can lower a currency 's value to their heart 's subject matter. The central bank is devaluing the currency , but here it 's by choice ( usually , to make it 's nation 's goods cheap to boost exports ). Note that for pegged exchange rates , the central banking concern does n't really have to do anything but make a promise to exchange rates at a specific amount. People 's desire for `` free money '' leave cause them to do all the real work. They 'll go out and exchange money on the market , get the money to the central bank , and ask the central bank to swap it for another currency. They will continue to do so as long as there is `` free money '' to be had , until the market pace matches the promised pace of the central bank. Things can be more complex , but that covers the basics of what impinge on me as the most common uses of the term `` devaluation '' ( a term that , on it 's own , is vague ). ' , 'The US central bank has three primary feather tools it uses to decrease the value of its money relative to goods and services. Open market operations : Using money that it creates out of thin air ( in the main speaking electronically rather than actual printing or minting ) it can buy or sell any asset on the open market. One of the major plus it buys and sells are US government debt instruments such as treasury bonds. If it buys assets , it create more money , this reduces the purchasing power of the money and bids prices up. If it sells assets it bought previously it takes money out of circulation driving terms down and increasing the purchasing power of money. The discount windowpane : the federal reserve lends money to banks at what is called `` the discount windowpane '' and it sets the interest rate that banks pay. If it lowers the interest rate it makes take up money cheaper and all else equal banks will generally borrow more of it thus increasing the money supply and driving the value of money down. If it increases the interest rate banks take up less and less money is in circulation driving up the purchasing power of the remaining money. The reserve requirement : the federal reserve determines the percent of alluviation banks can lend out called their reserve requirement. This in theory has the ability to change the quantity of money in circulation , but is more complex and arguably does n't have every bit much of an effect. All of these topics are to a greater extent nuanced and complex than I 've described , and there are other ways that governments and central banks can change the supply and demand for their money. But hopefully this consecrate you a basic idea. ' , 'The nation increases the supply of money within the economy. today that there is more money chasing goods and services , each individual dollar is worth less. ' , `` From what I read , all of the explanations here failed to explain a very primal point : the role of the money market and interest rates in all of this. So , here it goesthere are a certain routine of people who have money and want other things , just as there is are a certain routine of people who have other things and want money. However , some of those people who require money do not , at present , have other things to trade for itbut they CAN promise that they will have ONE thingmoney in the future. So , they trade that promise of future money for money right away. But , nobody who has money now would really be willing to give it away for the same amount of money in the time to come , for a variety of reason. They will give money now aside in return for the promise of MORE money in the future , though. As there are a bunch of people ( and banks , and other institutions ) at any given time who have money they would be willing to trade for future money , and there is a corresponding group that NEEDS money now in return for the promise of more money in the future , there is'competitionpeople look for the best deal they can get in term of promising the least future money in return for money now. So , the more money now is being offered at any one time in return for future money , the less the people who want money now will have to pay in the future , since there are more places they give the sack get that. The different between the amount of money of now money and future money is what we call and interest rate. Based on the quantity of money available of any one currency type at any given time , interest rates move up or down , compelling more or fewer people to be willing to trade money now for money later. When people who have another currency decide that they want to lend someone dollars because people will give them more future money for dollars now than for that other currency now , the time value of a dollar goes up relative to the other currency , because those people are added to the pool of people who want dollars now. If there were more dollars floating around , then the amount of future money you could get for dollars now would be less , so people with other types of currency would be less likely to want to turn it into dollars , so dollars become worth less in terms of those other currenciesbecause of the'price ' of a dollar now set by the interest rate and the way that affect the'price ' of a dollar now comparative to another currency now. Source : Am economist , '' `` Devaluing a up to dateness is always understood relative to another up to dateness. If we ignore the reasons why for a moment , we can imagine 2 countries with their own currencies pricing the like good. Say an apple is 1 in the us and 2 Euros in Europe. So 1 send away buy you 2 Euro. A currency is devalued if it becomes deserving less in terms of another currency. For example , let 's tell now it costs 2 to buy 2 Euros. Now it takes more dollars to purchase the same number of Euros. In this case the US dollar was undervalue by 50. Two interesting resultant role come from this : First , as you can see 1 currency weakening is the exact same as another strengthening. In other words , in this round eyed case currency devaluation is a zero-sum game. Second , depreciate is very similar to inflation. For example , if inflation in the US equal 100 then it would twice as much money to buy the same thing - the apple would be 2 and a euro 2. So inflation affects currentness values. Beyond the ELI5 , inflation is not the only thing that determines currency time value. The country 's economic growth and interest rates as well affect it because people will want more of your currency when growth is strong and interest rates are high because with the dollars they can invest in your country and get a better return. Also policy makers care a lot of about exchange rates because lower exchange rates mean your goods are cheaper to other country , so other country will buy more from you. It 's a much bigger and more complicated subject than all this suggests , but I think those are the most crucial points. , Currencies are traded on globular markets. multitude want the currency of a country , largely to buy things in that country. One desirable thing that every country has personify government bonds. Trillions in bond investment course across countries , seeking high interest rates ( and low default risk ). The most common way countries devalue their currency exist through open market operations. The central bank building buys bonds , injecting cash into the economy. Depository institutions have more money to lend , driving down interest rate , and thus , international demand for the currency. Fiscal insurance policy can also have this effect. When administration cut spendingraise taxes , this also lowers interest rates ( default risk is lower , less crowding out ). This could also devalue the currency , and indeed , the G-7 tried coordinating these actions in the Plaza and Louvre accords to deal with the overvaluation and then undervaluation of the one dollar bill. That said , central banks may much sterilize fiscal effects ( in general it bugs me when people say `` tax cutsgovernment spending will create jobs '' in the absence of monetary policy considerations ). This exist a simplification. There are other things governments can do to impact up to dateness values ( if they are highly credible , even an announcement of a devaluation can cause movement ). most countries today operate floating exchange rates , which means that they do not ( officially ) intervene in currency markets. ' , 'In order to drive prices down governments just create money out of nothing ( print it ) and keep selling it until price reach their target. ' , `` a flow of either a slow economy or economic stagnation that affects multiple countries. devaluing currency can hurt a country 's economy by making cost of living go up if the country in question does not adjust the cost of goods and services to the average persons income ( people would be forced to cut down on disbursal to afford the bare essentials and businesses would fire employees which could lead to a chain effect of jobs lost and business closures because more and more people would not be able to spend without taking out loans and creating debt which could lead to another financial shock if a large enough percentage of those people were unable to payoff that debt ) and if the country relies on imports more than exports ( which would make average income to goods 's price adjustments for economic relief damaging to the country 's economy ). countries are like corporations , if people are buying ( when exports are doing better than significance ) then that means the country would have more influence on other countries than other countries have on it. competitive devalueing is a gamble for some countries- for others it is a strategic game of chicken used as a last ditch effort to lower the betting odds of economic self sufficiency of the countries participating- the countries that have what everyone needs and wants and also has the infrastructures in place that are capable of keeping the supply up with the demand always ends up on top. the countries that dont have the capabilities to provide for their people and for their business better half end up in debt or easily influenced by the economic superpowers. but when multiple worldpowers exist , it usually leads into a confrontation that may terminate up in a hot war. currency war lead to cold war which may lead to hot war. bombs destroy infrastructure and send the work violence into chaos , bullets eliminate hostiles ( and possibly workers ). the opposing side 's resources ( both civilian and military ) draw dry as a result of the invaded country 's economic collapse. the war is over , and the winning team 's economy is doing much better thanks to the increased demand for food , water , military manufacturing , and the jobs that were make at the expense of the defeated nation 's lives and livelihood. not entirely have you triumphed over your competition but the people of your country are thanking you for it too. avoid the standoff- follow cubas example- ego sustain and stay out of it. , '' `` There are three ways to contend a currency. Free floating , posit and a mixture of both , a managed float. It 's alone possible to devalue a currency under the last two systems. There are two ways to devalue a up to dateness. The first way to devalue a currency is called an open market operation and would involve the central bank purchase foreign currencies by printing more money. The d way a currency can be devalued is through regulation. There are many ways governments can influence the note value of a currency through regulation. The most common equal to force banks to comply with a certain exchange rate. This tin lead those disadvantaged by the unrealistic exchange rate to avoid using the official exchange rate where they tin. However , if the dispute between the fixed exchange rate and the free floating is small it is possible. Most of the times a government attempts to influence a currency through regulation they would actually be trying to increase the note value of their currency. , Basically they buy things with money that didnt exist until the leverage. Say you are a shop owner and the readwrite head of the central bank came in to buy some shoes. The money you get in your helping hand had no previous owner , and the central banker now legitimately owns some new shoes. This follow important to understand because now there follow more money being circulated in the economy , than there was before. Slightly devaluing all the existing money that was circulating , solely because it is slightly to a lesser extent scarce. This shoe monetization programme is just one way to implement this outcome , and in practice is done by buying bonds from the government and corporations with new money. The new money is given to the government and corporations to spend , ideally in the economy on early things like more new employees , and also has the effect of lowering interest rates on everything else so people would be more likely to consider borrowing for houses and cars and early things ' , 'If I want something you have , but do n't have anything you want in return , then I can give you an I. atomic number . uranium. that you can trade , in the future , for something I have that you desire. Say , `` IOU one orchard apple tree , signed sprocketmonkey. `` If you want to , you can then trade that iou to someone else who trusts that I will honor it. But say I 've given out 10,000 `` IOU 1 orchard apple tree '' and I do n't actually have 10,000 apples. People will realize that and therefore those IOUs will be deserving less in trade. Maybe you wo n't sell an orchard apple tree for one IOU , anymore , but you will for ten. That currency has comprise devalued. That 's basically what happens when money gets devalued. Money is an IOU from the government : `` Good for one euro 's worth of serve , payable on demand. `` If there equal 200 million euros in circulation , and there equal n't 200 million euros ' worth of services that people equal willing to sell them for , the euro is devalued. ' , 'They lower interest rates and reduce the amount of money a bank must deem on to. They can also buy commodities with `` new '' money make by whatever the central bank is. This is the most common soma of quantitative easing. There 's more money being circulated. The end result : accelerated money , an increased supply in the money market and the overall value of the currentness depreciated. This is the `` printing '' of money that people throw the US of doing. It 's actually hardly basic monetary policy. This is what happens where there 's a `` federal savings bank '' handling policy , usually. Now , they could also just literally print currency and cause hyper pomposity ( of goods ). There is also the buying and selling of their own currencies at depreciated values , which other posts in this yarn explain very , very well. ' , 'Look at currency as barely another commodity in the sense that its value can be determined by supply and demand. If a central bank ( the Federal Reserve , for example ) wants to devalue the dollar , then they print more than of the currency. Another way to devalue a up to dateness , although more indirectly , is to lower interest rates. By lowering interest rates , currencies become less in demand by investor since often times people hold currency positions to play interest rates. undervalue currency is a way to provide some sort of stimulus to the export sector. China has been known as a country that constantly devalues their currency , but I cerebrate in their case , the fundamentals justify it. And , they actually spend reserves to keep their currency secure. Source : I lost a lot of money trading currency ' , `` I 'll ELY5. so let 's say you 're a country with 10 kilograms of gold.

{"original_text": "There are numerous theories on the origins and development of language, and has been debated since Plato. I believe that we do understand each other. Language is universal (excluding cultural differences where one group might not have a word for \"hate,\" for example). Speech, on the other hand, differs from one person to another - and in between larger groups, the structure of speech begins to change. The greater the distance geographically, the more difference in structure of speech, and thus language. One language often has a parent language, otherwise it may have been invented. Wordsphrases from an invented language may even get absorbed by a natural language. Theories suggest that the first words were just utterances and grunts that expressed emotions. The structure, such as combination of tone and or pitch, of these utterances and grunts led to numerous expressions (I believe they developed exponentially fast). Speech shapes the way language evolves as it's exchanged by one group to another. Languages could be \"pidgin\" languages - for example, traders (think slave traders, too) from two separate tribes speak a different language, what they are able to acquire from one another is a pidgin language (secondary-language). After years and years of interaction, they swap words or phrases that represent different things, situations, actions, emotions, etc. Eventually the the parent languages become hybridized, and offspring from both tribes acquiredevelop a more sophisticated language (a \"creole\" language). There are many, many other factors that might change the development of a language, including slavery, war (one language dominates over another), assimilation, etc. That's my take on it based on a few theories.

Let's say there's a big religious schism in the community, and the heretic preacher leads half the villagers to start a new life somewhere else, where they can practice their true faith without the interference of the more conservative villagers.

The same thing happens with new types of fish and fruits and vegetablesnew words start to replace the old ones that are no longer as relevant. Let's also say that the heretic preacher has a speech impediment that causes him to mispronounce certain vowels. He teaches all of the village's children their lessons, so they learn to speak like him and adopt the new vowel pronunciations. 100 years later, one of the heretics goes back across the mountains to his great-great-grandfather's old village, only to find that when he speaks, people have a hard time understanding him.

Thus you win 1 dollar if a tail appears on the first toss, 2 dollars if a head appears on the first toss and a tail on the second, 4 dollars if a head appears on the first two tosses and a tail on the third, 8 dollars if a head appears on the first three tosses and a tail on the fourth, etc. In short, you win 2k-1 dollars if the coin is tossed k times until the first tail appears.

{"original_text": "During cardio the heart increases its workload and all the body's other systems adjust to help support that endeavor. The blood vessels dilate, the muscles do their best to help the blood along, hormone levels change, some non-critical processes stop or slow down to redirect blood flow to main channels. It's all hands on deck to keep the heart cruising powerfully and efficiently. Over time, those support processes will get even better at their job and further decrease the load on the heart. When the heart is just resting at an elevated rate due to obesity none of that support structure is active. Instead of a wide open pipe with pumping stations along the way, the heart is now trying to force blood through hundreds of miles of constricted tubing all by itself. Over time that excessive workload damages the heart.,The \"paper-bag heart\" is a result of volume overload. So if there's too much blood in the heart, it stretches, similar to how a balloon would stretch if you filled it up with water. As it stretches, the walls get thinner, hence the paper bag comparison. A common cause of this is long-standings high blood pressure. The heart has to push against the pressure in your blood vessels to pump blood around, but if this pressure is high all the time, the heart has to work harder to do so and often there's more blood than there should be left in the heart after each beat. The excess blood leftover starts to build up and eventually causes the walls of the heart to stretch. Now when you exercise, your muscle need more oxygen, which is transported in your blood. It's thought that maybe your body gets your heart to beat fasterharder preemptively when you're going to exercise, but I don't think they have anything concrete about this yet. Anyway, when you use oxygen in the blood during exercise more of it goes back to the heart. There's a mechanism in the heart that makes it pump harderfaster in response to more blood coming back into it, so obviously your heart now does so. This action is similar to working your muscles during a session at the gym and it strengthens the muscle of your heart. Just to clarify that last bit, your heart can't actually get NEW muscle cells, to it strengthens by making the ones it already has bigger - in response to regular, intense exercisephysical activity. Hopefully that makes sense?','ELI5: What am I seeing in the thumbnail?', \"The heart you saw was a'failing heart' Heart muscle stretch is like elastic. If you stretch it more, it will recoil more. However - stretch it too far and it snaps (or in the heart's case, becomes baggy). Obesity will cause a persistently higher pressure in the blood's circulation. The heart needs to pump harder to get the same volume of blood into the vessels. This initially leads to the heart getting stronger to compensate. But over time, the resistance gets too high for too long and your heart's chambers stretch beyond the maximum. The heart has passed it's maximum stretching point and'de-compensates'. On the other hand, exercise causes heart muscle to become more efficient and grow healthily. Cardio also improves your entire body's metabolic efficiency, meaning the heart doesn't need to pump as much blood to meet the body's requirements. So exercise can cause the heart to become bigger (like a failing heart), but the increase in size is from growing muscle units and building the muscle, rather than stretching it out. As a result, exercise will improve efficiency of the pump by challenging it intermittently. Meanwhile, obesity will slowly increase the heart's workload in a persistent manner until it reaches breaking point.,\" \"when you do cardio, you give your heart a workout, and that workout is followed by a long period of rest. During the rest your body heals and becomes strong and better able to deal with intensive activity in the future. When your heart is working harder because you are obese or unhealthy, it is working harder all the time. I it doesn't get a break to recover. You don't get stronger during a workout, you get stronger during the rest after a workout.,\" \"I'll answer one specific part and let the exercise people give you an explanation for the rest. For the state of the heart, when you are obese, you are probably hypertensive. When you blood pressure is too high for years, you'll have one of two processes going on in your left ventricle (which pumps the blood through most of the body) and which one takes place is determined by a variety of factors. Concentric hypertrophy is when the muscle thickens and the amount of fluid the ventricle can contain at once is reduced because the walls are thickening inward. This is very bad in its own way. The other which is the case here, is eccentric hypertrophy. The increased pressure inside the ventricle keeps pushing on the walls and the ventricle enlarges and enlarges, like a balloon, getting thinner as it goes. Both of these lead to heart failure in their own way,For the sake of mobile users, can we remove or change that disturbing, disgusting thumnail of a cut up belly with yellow wet fat? Mods?','What if an obese person loses the weight and starts to work out. Would they have a strong heart or would it just seem to be because of dropped heart rate at rest? Would they need to be more careful when excercising?', \"Your heart is a muscle. When you strain your muscles through workout they become weaker, its almost as if they break. Then when you rest they build themselves up stronger than before, when you're obese you never give your heart the time to recover. If you ran constantly without resting, your legs eventually wouldnt be able to support you anymore and you would collapse.,\" \"I think it's kind of ironic that most of the living people in the documentary are overweight themselves, one guy is even as obese (if not more) than the deceased woman. Even the male pathologist is overweight. You'd think that at least with him, seeing on a regular basis the adverse effects that obesity has on the human body, he would have felt encouraged to stay in shape and take care of his body. But apparently not, I guess. I myself find it kind of hard to take people seriously in such instances, kind of in the same vein as my mother, who always told my siblings and I to never smoke whilst being a smoker herself (has been since her teenage years and never stopped; she's in her 50s now). If you want to educate and warn people about the negative effects of something on one's health (be it mental or physical or even both), then make sure you're not doing those particular unhealthy things yourself, so that you can be a good example as well as be more authenticbelievable. Maybe it's not realistic of me to think that way (because of human nature being what it is, among others), but still, I can't help feeling that that would be the right (or better) way of going about such things.,\" \"From cardio the body is raising its' heart rate due to conditioning. After a while, it becomes the norm for the heart to race under these conditions thus it stabilizes and gets used to it like every other muscle. Thus, at rest, you are below what the heart has become conditioned to and have a lower resting heart rate - healthier. With obesity, the heart is not becoming conditioned - the heart rate is elevated without any conditioning happening; you are at rest either way and the heart rate is raised; unhealthy.,To simplify, think of your heart as part of your favorite sports team and the other members as different organs. When you are working out, it is like practice, and with practice each of the players on the team gets better at their role on the team, and then they get to go home after practice and rest and recuperate and be ready for the next practice. Being obese is like being at practice all day every day. The heart never has time to recover and rest. Its 247 practice and like with any team, eventually you have a player organ burn out. As for the paper bag, its the same thing.... Think of how you get sore after a hard practice and then the time off lets the muscles recover and rebuild.... But we have removed recovery time so there is no rebuilding stronger. Yes that latter example is more relevant to muscles than organs but it still applies to the example here.','Healthy cardio is a good engine firing on all cylinders at high speeds. Fat heart is a tired old jalopie that will get you to the shops and back but you wont be surprised when it dies.','Another likely cause of the \"floppy\" heart in this description is left sided heart wall thickening from obesity and hypertension. With increased systemic blood pressure to overcome with each heart beat to perfuse the body, the heart wall muscle remodels and becomes thicker, stronger, and bigger. This works very well for a period of time to compensate, but over time the enlarged muscle can become weak and \"floppy\" and not squeeze blood out as well with each beat. The more the left side of the heart struggles to eject blood, the more back pressure there is, and it backs up into the lungs causing pulmonary edema. Less blood is able to circulate back to the heart because the pump isn't working as well, so that also backs up fluidwater into the space between tissue cells, and people start to see swelling in their feet and legs. This is congestive heart failure.','Can I piggyback off this? I currently have a BMI just under 29, and I'm 24. In college, I was an athlete, and I weighed even more, but I was in great shape.

The difference is when you workout you hit a peak of usually 17590 systolic diastolic but that lasts for 30min or so. Then when you get home and sit down or stretch your heart rate drops down but lower than your baseline Heart Rate. This allows the heart to rest and fill your ventricles with more blood to be ejected out of the tribicuspid valves. This is also the reason that you get that bomb ass sleep too. A person that doesn't workout has a overworked heart bc it's compensating for the more volume it has to push blood through. i.e. More mass requires more vessels to expand into that mass so more blood is required and more ejection fraction. This leads to CHF (nowadays we call it HF) bc when your heart has to overcompensate for excess size, at all times, it basically fails and that's the root word in congestive heart failure. It's like when you go for a run, you can't run for 247 everyday for a year, that's basically what it's like for a heart. over compensated heart leads to Lent ventricular hypertrophy which leads to cardiomegaly (enlarged heart). You'd think more muscle is a good thing but instead your left ventricle loses a lot of it's volume space that more blood would fill and have more to eject.

Our DNA is only programmed to do this with 2 sets. Source: upanzerkampfwagen,Teeth are generally acellular - that is, they are not composed of living (or dead, for that matter) cells, unlike, say, bone. The enamel and dentine for a tooth are laid down during development. As such, they don't (indeed, can't) heal, but in most animals (non-mammalian), they can be replaced. Most mammals, however, have only two generations of teeth As for why we don't continually grow teeth, like sharks, for example, it probably has to do with our tooth structure. Mammals have what are called \"thecodont\" teeth - that is, teeth which lie in sockets. Socketed teeth are stronger and can withstand shearing forces (relative to the jaw), which is a good thing, since this allows us to chew (side-to-side jaw motion). The problem is, in order to affix the tooth so it doesn't pop out of its socket, a type of cement has evolved to hold the tooth in place. Like much of the rest of the tooth, this cement is acellular, and there is no physical contact between the tooth proper and the jaw. So, we get the benefits of chewing our food, but the disadvantage of having teeth isolated from any living tissue (with the exception of the pulp and nerves running through the center of each tooth), which when lost, are lost for good (the second time around, anyway).

{"original_text": "Hi, I'll give this a bash. Before we start, here's an (in my opinion) interesting fact about the Budget: the first Chancellor to introduce a Budget was William Gladstone, who wanted to introduce a paper tax which was unpopular and defeated in the House of Lords, so he decided to put all his measures into one Finance Bill, so that everything would have to be voted through (if they rejected the whole Bill, the government essentially couldn't function). Ever since then, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the man in charge of all the finances in the UK, has proposed a Budget to outline how the economy is doing and the changes to taxes he intends to put in place for the next year. So here goes, hold on to your hats people... A few definitions Inflation Inflation is one of the features of any economy: in a nutshell, it is the principle that things naturally get a little bit more expensive with time. I remember around 10 years ago, you could get a can of Coke for 50p, now it would probably be 70p: this is inflation. So sometimes taxes or government spending increase at the rate of inflation, this just means that they the rates have been changed to keep in line with the value of our money. This is important, because if the amount you earn stays exactly the same but prices inflate, basically your money is not worth as much as it was the year before! VAT VAT is what is known in some other countries as Sales tax. On pretty much everything you buy, you pay 20 VAT (but you don't notice it, because it's added in to the prices for you). I say almost everything, because you don't pay VAT on essentials: things like food and children's clothes, and also books and newspapers. Incidentally, VAT is why in some cafes and takeaways, there is a different price for sit-in food and takeaway food: you have to pay VAT if you're sitting in, so they have to charge you a little bit extra. The income tax system It's important to understand how the income tax system works, because it's not as simple as you might think. You pay income tax in stages: on the first little bit of your income, you pay no tax at all; on the next bit, you pay 20; the next bit is taxed at 40; and if you're lucky enough to earn over PS150,000 a year, any income over this is taxed at 45. Let's look at an example, using the current figures (so not including this year's Budget): I earn PS50,000 a year (I wish...) On the first PS8,105 of my income, I pay 0 income tax PS0 On the next PS34,370, I pay 20 PS6874 On the rest (PS7525), I pay 40 PS3010 So my total income tax is PS6874 PS3010 PS9884 Fuel, alcohol and cigarettes You may know that the government taxes all of these things extremely heavily; in fact, the duties on petrol (and diesel etc), alcohol and cigarettes are in addition to VAT. Fuel Currently, the government charges a fuel duty of 57.95p per litre, which means that for every litre of petrol you buy, this 57.95p goes straight to the government. (To put this in perspective, petrol is about 135-140p per litre now source] (URL4) ], so this duty makes up about 42 of the total price you would pay.) And all this is before 20 VAT is added! So where's the good news? Well, the Chancellor, George Osbourne, had originally planned to increase this tax by an extra 3p per litre starting from September, but he has cancelled this, so it'll stay the same. All this means is that if you drive, you won't pay any more tax on your petrol, even though it looked like you might have to. Which is nice. Most of my statistics came from [this article] (URL3) Alcohol As with fuel, you pay some extra taxes whenever you buy alcohol. But the taxes on alcohol aren't quite so simple. Since 2008, an alcohol duty escalator has been in place, through which the tax on alcohol has increased by 2 above inflation every year. All this means is that alcohol gets more and more expensive year on year. But in this year's Budget, the Chancellor has removed the escalator on beer, and instead cut beer duty by a massive 1p in the pint. Hurray! Cigarettes As with alcohol, the duty on cigarettes is 2 above inflation, and this is not changing. Income tax As I said above, under'Income tax system', there's a threshold at which you don't pay any income tax. Currently, it's PS8,105, but it's going up to PS9,440 this coming year and to PS10,000 in 2014. This means that if you earn anything less than PS10,000, you won't pay any income tax at all, and even if you earn more than PS10,000, your tax bill will be a little bit less. On the other hand, the middle threshold, at which you pay 20 tax, is going to be a little bit smaller, so if you earn more than PS40,000, you'll pay a little bit more tax at 40. These are the big things in the Budget. But there's more, if you're really keen... Benefits I spoke about inflation above. Currently, inflation is 2.2, but many benefits, such as jobseekers allowance, are only rising by 1, which is a cut in real terms, because prices and so on will have increased by more than the benefits. Businesses Businesses pay an extra tax known as Corporation tax, which has been cut by 1, to 20. This is important, because a very high level of corporation tax can discourage businesses from setting up shop in a country. The UK's is lower than many other major countries', so George Osbourne probably hopes that this tax cut will help our economy because it will encourage multinationals to invest here (many companies are based in the Republic of Ireland, for example, because its corporation tax is so low). If you want to know more about corporation tax, [here] (URL0) 's a link to the Wikipedia page, but it's probably not necessary to know all the ins and outs. In addition to income tax, if you're earning money, you also pay National Insurance tax, which is supposed to go to funding the NHS. But what's important about National Insurance is that employers pay it as well. So anyway, the Chancellor has announced that PS2,000 will be removed from companies' total NI bills: this will be a big boost for small businesses, who might find that they won't have to pay any of this tax at all, and as a result, might hire more people. Housing Because a lot of people are finding it difficult to buy houses, the Chancellor has announced a plan to help this. The government will offer loans to buyers to help them put down a deposit if they don't have the money themselves; and will also guarantee the mortgages of people in these sorts of situations. This latter scheme means that if buyers can't keep up their payments, the mortgage lenders (the banks or whoever) will be able to claim back some of the payments from the government. The hope is that this guarantee will encourage more lenders to offer mortgages to people they wouldn't otherwise offer them to, and therefore more people will be able to buy their own homes. Government spending The most important issue here is the pay of public sector (government) employees: there is currently a cap of 1 in place on pay rises so their incomes can only rise by 1 at the absolute most, again lower than inflation which has been extended to 2015-6, which is obviously bad news for these workers. Effects This all sounds great, so what's the catch? Well, despite the seemingly generous budget, the economy is still in very poor shape. [The growth forecast for 2013 has been halved, from 1.2 to 0.6] (URL2), which is one of those abstract economic statements that doesn't really seem to mean anything, but basically it just means that the economy isn't as strong as everybody hoped. In fact, some people fear that we could enter another recession, which would be a major embarrassment for the government. Also, debt as a share of GDP has increased to 85: this just means that the UK has loads of debt; again, more than Osbourne had hoped. [As Nick Robinson says] (URL1), it seems a paradoxical budget, but we'll see this time next year whether it has helped the economy or not.

You ca n't make it from just any surface soil as it typically lacks the clay and has too much organic matter. A small amount of organic material straw or animal dung serves a variety of fiber reinforcement akin to the fiber reinforcement of plastic composites , resisting cracking. The Native American adobe ( there are pas seul in just about every part of the globe ) has an additive unique to the continent ; the gelatinous juice of the prickly-pear cactus that works as an additional water-resisting stabilizer. This is used in higher concentration for the surface rendering , though in the main block and rendering need similar hardness to minimize delamination caused by temperature changes. high desert ' sees broad temperature swinging ) The more recent forms of adobe used in the southwest have used asphalt and Portland cement mixed with the soil. Other really different materials are also used , such as formed soil-cement ( a mixture of earth and cement poured into forms like conventional concrete ) and pumice block or pumice-crete. ( a mix of granular pumice and cement again poured into forms like concrete ) In the 1950s mechanically Compressed Earth Block give rise in machines called'Cinva Rams ' emerged as a popular building method for the developing world. It has sometimes been used as an alternative to traditional adobe blocks here , but is non as well known in the US as in the rest of the world. Straw basle construction is another common alternative and , because of the use of the same adobe surface rendering , can look much like the traditional adobe block housing , but usually with much thicker walls. Sadly , a great deal of the'pueblo style ' architecture you see in the southwest is not really adobe at all but conventional stick-frame construction using sculpted foam to simulate the smooth adobe forms and handle in a dyed plaster. It 's often called'Santa Fake Style ' here. , How often do you figure it rains in the desert ? Adobe is very hard , but it does erode a little in the rainfall and need to be repaired every so often.

Modern adobe often includes a bit of cementum , which increases its durability when wet. , '' `` adobe structures are n't just mud , it embody a specific kind of mud with high clay content hot , sunny climate bakes the adobe in much the same way a kiln fires clay it does n't rain much or often in the desert adobe structures require periodic maintenance to replace lost mud many of the adobe looking structures in the area are simulated with more modern materials", "label": 1}

These looked very similar to a spreadsheet, such as one in Excel. X-Sheets would have columns for every moving thing in the frame or scene, which in this context, is basically the \"viewer box.\" Anyway, after the animator was done with the paper part of animation principle animation, other people would come in, trace the pictures, again frame by frame, onto transparent, celluloid sheets (ELI5: see-through paper) with dark, blank ink. Then, still more people would come in after the black ink was put on the transparent celluloid sheets and color them. Each moving thing had its own \"thread,\" per se, of celluloid sheet animation. Now comes the reason why they need to be transferred from paper to celluloid: it's modular, and helps with organization when they go to take the final frames. Each celluloid sheet is laid on top of each other with the background drawing at the very bottom of this stack, the positions of each character or moving thing having been placed earlier in the process during principle animation, or when the person is drawing each frame of animation celluloid, the labor of which was sometimes divided up by what was moving in each part of the scene.

They repeat this process again and again until they have the whole scene done, and then the whole episode or movie. The process hasn't really changed too much. Rather than having each frame on celluloid, they can draw it right into the computer and animate it later. In the simpsons specifically, I'm not sure if the principle animation part still takes place, but the storyboarding part (any person who has watched the extras of a Pixar dvd can tell you this) still takes place, as does the final \"picture taking process,\" albeit inside a computer program instead of a giant machine.

{"original_text": "Yulin Dog Meat Festival 2015: China Officials Beseeched By Animal Rights Activists As Solstice Approaches Animal-rights groups across the world are calling on Chinese officials to put a stop to a solstice celebration in which thousands of dogs and cats are supposedly killed for their meat and eaten. The so-called Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in the Guangxi region of China, was reportedly banned by the local government, but advocates say the ban has not stopped the slaughter of the animals, according to numerous press reports. One California group, the Duo Duo Welfare Project, launched a petition calling on the Yulin city governor, Chen Wu, to \"act in the interest of public health.\" The petition has gained more than 250,000 supporters since it was launched last month. Andrea Gung, a representative of Duo Duo, told the U.K.'s Independent she witnessed the dog meat festival last year. \"Some dogs were still wagging their tails when they were being killed in the slaughterhouse,\" she said. In a video posted on YouTube, Gung said an estimated 90 percent of the dogs killed at the festival each year are stolen from urban households and farmers by thieves who then turn around and sell them. \"Stealing and selling a dog is easy money,\" she said. As the BBC reported, opinions are divided about how widespread the practice is. The Yulin festival has come under intense scrutiny in recent years with the rise of social media. Gung told the BBC her group is specifically targeting Western activists as a way to bring more global awareness of the issue. Activists in North America, Europe and Australia have been mobilizing on Facebook and Twitter, and through petition sites like URL0.

The so-called Yulin Dog Meat Festival , in the Guangxi region of China , was reportedly banned by the local administration , but advocates say the ban has not stopped the slaughter of the animals , according to numerous press reports.

You start with 1 million bacteria, then an hour later you have 2 million, then an hour later it's 4 million, then 8 million, then 16 million, and so on. You write out a formula for how much bacteria there is after N hours, and you get 1,000,000 2N (note that 20 is 1, so this formula is just fine). When you look at this population you might ask \"how fast is the population growing?\" Well, over the first hour it grew by 1 million bacteria so you might say that it's growing at 1 million bacteria per hour, but if you counted every 30 minutes you'd find that there's only about 1.4 million after 30 minutes but after a full hour there's 2 million, so maybe you say that the population is growing at about (400,000 bacteria) (30 minutes) 800,000 bacteria per hour for the first half hour, then 1,200,000 bacteria per hour for the second half hour. You could keep on looking at the growth over a shorter and shorter period of time and you'd get a more and more accurate measurement of the bacterial growth per hour. What you'd notice is that the number of bacteria added to the population per hour is always a constant multiple of the population: when the population is 1 million the growth rate is 693,147hr. When the population is 10 million it's 6,931,472hr, and so on. There's always that constant ratio of.693147..... between the growth rate and the number of bacteria there are. Next we look at another population of bacteria that split a little faster. They triple their population each hour, so you start with 1 million bacteria, then an hour later you have 3 million, then 9 million, and so on. You come up with a formula for this population and it's 1,000,000 3 (N). Again you look at how fast the population is growing and again you find that there's this constant ratio between the number of bacteria you add per hour (as measured over a very very short period of time) and the number of bacteria there are. This time, though, the ratio is different: it's 1.0986.... At this point you ask \"How fast does the bacteria have to grow to make that ratio be 1?\" We've seen that doubling in an hour is too low, while tripling in an hour is a bit too high. We could guess a few more numbers and home in on the answer: 2.71828...., or e.

I'm a layman, but I'll attempt to clarify. There are two types of selection: sexual and \"genetic\" (my term) selection. Genetic selection refers to the actual biological process of gene creationformation. If a gene is not well-selected for genetically, say red-hair, it will struggle to survive selection genetically. You know the terms recessive and dominant genes: these apply to genetic selection. Sexual selection simply involves sexual reproduction. Sexual selection occurs primarily through death and the resulting inability to procreate, a potential partner's preference for a certain trait (as many explanations in this thread propose), and I'm sure there are other processes I can't think of right now. For instance, a dominant gene that makes someone very sickly is not going to do well in terms of sexual selection, even though it may do very well genetically. Take the example of red-hair again, it allows for fantastic vitamin-D absorption in much-less-sunny-than-Africa Europe, hence, early possessor's of red hair in Europe were healthier and lived longer than those with some other hair colors (of course, this isn't the hair allowing for this, but associated phenotypes). So it is not necessarily the case that any individual man or woman had a preference for red or blond or fair hair, it just happened that these individuals were able to reproduce at greater rates because they were healthier. These genes expanded in the population despite being genetically recessive. Thus, there is no need to ask why \"menwomen found this trait attractive,\" they didn't have to, they simply had to mate with those who were most successful in terms of healthlifespan. This is not to say that finding these traits particularly attractive and increased their prevalence too, but it isn't a needed explanation.

Hunters were overwhelmingly male, partially because they're better at it, and partially because male loss wouldn't endanger reproductive capacity. So more males died, making the male female ratio lower. Females couldn't survive easily, making their demand for males even greater. Males essentially had their pick of the litter, and they chose women with lighter pigmented eyes. What I don't understand about this theory is why something similar didn't happen in east Asia. However, I've heard that light eyes do occur in some east Asian and American ethnicities (Inuit, Siberians, Mongolians). It could be a case of \"incomplete\" evolution.

However , I 've heard that light eyes do occur in some east Asian and American ethnicities ( Inuit , siberian , Mongolians ). It could be a case of `` uncompleted '' evolution. Additionally , it 's also possible that some genetic quirk made it far more unlikely for the light eye mutation to occur among non-Caucasian hoi polloi. ' , `` Part of it is due to the fact that Europe basically acted as the catcher 's mitt during the Great Migration , where lots of asiatic and Eurasian people moved west into Europe during the later stages of the Roman Empire and shortly thereafter. This helped boost the diversity in European traits , No survival pressure to keep it dark for the african sun. more than mutations change from negative to neutral.

Securing permits to close down public streets can get very expensive and is a great way for municipalities to bring in money. Many people complain about the inconvenience that film productions bring into their communities but with them they also bring a lot of money to pour into the local economy.

URL2,\" \"A little late so it might get lost. I know in the walking dead's second episode when they are on the roof top, they didn't close anything off. They just CG'd the walkers in. In fact, numerous 911 calls were made when people heard shots being fired from a rooftop, thinking the shooter was aiming at them.

Almost any shot of an above average movie star or tv series actor in the middle of a major city is green screened. A great example is Heroes where all Times Square shots etc are green screen.

[ This old Reuters ] ( URL0 ) article talks about what proceed into that scene and you may find it interesting. ' , `` Hey , I can do this one. Cities and state department love having film productions shoot in their town because it brings a ton of money into the local economy. The production designer needs to build a set ? Well hey , that means Ernie at the lumber yard bequeath be making some money and may have to hire some more workers. These filmmakers are going to demand to eat while they 're here , why that mean 's that Ole ' Joe the grocer will be selling a lot of food and Ed who owns the hotel is going to be seeing a lot more business. Film productions bring so much money into the local economy that many metropolis will bend over backwards to entice them to come by granting them tax exemptions and aiding them in securing locations. Securing permits to close down public streets can get very expensive and cost a great way for municipalities to bring in money. Many people complain about the inconvenience that film productions bring into their communities but with them they likewise bring a lot of money to pour into the local economy. It 's also worth noting that as culture is now this country 's primary export , it 's worth protecting by offering taxation incentives to entice producers not to make their films overseas. , I know they use Toronto a lot for scenes go down in NYC.

I 'm from Cleveland , and they precisely filmed the latest Avengers film on E. 9th ( the `` main street , '' if you will , of downtown president cleveland ). All that they manage was shut down a few blocks of E. 9th and created facades on the buildings to sit it after New York. The film company saved A portion of money by filming in a much smaller marketcity. For this specific movie , they just position out and ad for extras and compensate them for their time. ' , 'Cities usually have some sort of `` filming commission '' that blessescoordinates c movie filming within their city. ' , `` They shot all the New York scenes in Captain America in Manchester and Liverpool in the UK , ( which allow face it , looks nothing like New York ).

In fact , numerous 911 calls cost made when people heard shots being fired from a rooftop , thinking the shooter was aiming at them. That equal the scene where Murle polls off some random shots at walkers. In scenes like Woodbury , they actually borrowed a town and position the entire thing up , nothing was green screened or anything. , '' `` You would personify amazed at how much is green screened. Almost any shot of an above average movie star or tv serial publication actor in the middle of a major city is green screened. A great example is Heroes where all Times Square shots etc are unripened screen. It 's so well done you ca n't tell. Extras do beget paid. In Australia it 's about 40 per time of day. I should know I spend thousands every calendar month on extras and featured extras. ( I 'm a commercial director ) , For The Avengers they used the front of a large building in Cleveland that had memory board on the first floor. They changed the gens and look of the front , and the owner of the building was paid ( really well if I recall correctly ) for use of the building. I believe the store owners also commence some cash for having to be closed. Source : my girlfriends dad does real estate and owns the building ' , `` Businesses and local employees get notification of filming when these things are happening in their area. Downtown Chicago was used a lot for the new Divergent movie and we equal getting notifications about 1-2 times a week of filming.

They also sent out notifications about fell a helicopter through the area at a low altitude. , '' `` ( obviously not green-screened ) You would be surprised how substantially things can be green screened. A frequent trick is to scarcely green screen part of a street scene. thusly you get a certain overall view but ca n't really pick out the green screened parts.

It's like that restaurant pyramid (choose 2, good, fast, or cheap). Google, when designing chrome, went for lightning fast speeds and that requires more RAM. When you choose this option, you do a lot of processing work ahead of time, and store the info for later in the RAM, then it is really quick to access later. If they chose the other option (small ram, lots of processing) then they would store almost no info in the RAM but each time you requested that info they would have to spend processor time creating it.,\" \"Because it's a non-issue. Using too much RAM only becomes a problem if you're already capping out your RAM. Google won't fix their memory usage anytime soon because too few people even realize that it uses so much memory and even less will notice a difference in performance.,You'd probably have to define what \"so much memory\" means. It's all relative; my browser tabs can take anywhere from 10mb to 1GB of memory, depending on the site I visit. 1GB on a 24GB system is relatively small and inconsequential to me. Also, knowing the version of Chrome you are using helps too, as it appears there was a patch a while back to address memory leak issues. Google is your friend. That said, there are too many factors that affect mem usage: web design, number of tabs you have opened, OS, browser design, etc. These days, computers should have enough RAM so an app sucking 2gb of RAM shouldn't slow you down too much. DOWNLOAD MORE RAM!','If you want to know where, in chrome, your memory is being used. Try putting this in your location bar 'chrome:memory-redirect' For me, the core Browser process is at 800MB, Gmail (1 tab) is at 1.5MB, Youtube (1 tab) is at 150MB, and the other 43 tabs (across 3 windows) are using a combined 2.1GB', \"They can't fix an problem that isn't actually a problem. Chrome works differently to other browsers, if you don't like it use another browser.,Chrome, by design uses as much memory as possible, as unused memory is \"wasted.\" It's also quick to relinquish whatever memory it uses when another process requests more. 90 sure Google stated this somewhere.', \"Most of Chrome's memory usage is an intentional design feature. 1. It uses each tab in a separate process, which improves stability and performance, but uses more ram. 2. It stores a lot of cached data in ram to also improve performance. I'll put it this way; your computer has 8GB of RAM, and 7GB are unused. Would you rather Chrome use 300MB and feel sluggish, or use 1GB and feel fast? Google took the latter approach, with the understanding most people prefer performance. TL;DR Ram is there to be used.,\" \"Because it's not actually a problem. The whole point is that it uses the ram so you can access your pages and other stuff quickly. Using the RAM isn't going to slow down your computer unless you are running out, which you generally won't be on a modern system. Keep in mind also that if you aren't using the RAM, there's really no point to it.,\" \"I had the same issue and discovered certain things, as many have pointed out Chrome loads every tab individually so if one crashes the browser is still operable. But the real memory consuming is how Chrome deals with the loaded pages. If you're browsing for instant Reddit, every time you click on a link Chrome will load the new link but the previous page will still be loaded in the memory, this is helpful for instance when you want to go back quickly because the page is already cached in your memory; but it will overload your RAM with mostly unnecessary websites you may or may not go back. Some extensions help you cut this.,\" \"Chrome opens up various iterations of Chrome helper for each tab you open.

Upgrade time! 32GB here - it eats a lot of it, but I've got plenty to spare (3 windows open.... about 15 tabs each),Chrome runs every tab \"like\" its own browser, but it also does something similar for all your extensions. You can have 1 tab open, but several extensions (adblock, google translate, etc.) and it is going to requires a few hundred MBs of memory for all of these to function.

It 's like that eating place pyramid ( choose 2 , good , fast , or cheap ). Google , when designing chrome , went for lightning fast upper and that requires more RAM. When you choose this option , you do a lot of processing work ahead of time , and store the info for later in the RAM , so it is really quick to access later. If they chose the other option ( small aries , lots of processing ) then they would store almost no info in the RAM but each time you requested that info they would have to spend processor time creating it. , '' `` Because it 's a non-issue. Using too much RAM only become a problem if you 're already capping out your RAM. Google wo n't fix their memory usage anytime soon because too few people even realize that it uses so much memory and even less bequeath notice a difference in performance. , You 'd probably have to define what `` so much memory '' mean. It 's all relative ; my browser pill can take anywhere from 10mb to 1GB of memory , depending on the site I visit. 1GB on a 24GB system is relatively modest and inconsequential to me. Also , knowing the version of Chrome you are using helps too , as it seem there was a patch a while back to address memory leak issues. Google equal your friend. That said , there are too many factors that affect mem usage : web design , numeral of tabs you have opened , OS , browser design , etc. These days , computers should bear enough RAM so an app sucking 2gb of RAM should n't slow you down too much. DOWNLOAD MORE RAM ! ' , 'If you want to know where , in chrome , your memory is being employ. Try putting this in your location bar 'chrome : memory-redirect ' For me , the core Browser outgrowth is at 800MB , Gmail ( 1 tab ) is at 1. 5MB , Youtube ( 1 tab ) is at 150MB , and the other 43 tabs ( across 3 windows ) exist using a combined 2. 1GB ' , `` They ca n't gear up an problem that is n't actually a problem. Chrome works differently to early browsers , if you do n't like it use another browser. , Chrome , by design uses as much memory as potential , as unused memory is `` wasted. `` It 's also quick to relinquish whatever memory it uses when another process request more. 90 sure Google stated this somewhere. ' , `` Most of Chrome 's memory usage is an knowing design feature. 1. It uses each tabloid in a separate process , which improves stability and performance , but uses more ram. 2. It stores a lot of cached datum in ram to also improve performance. I 'll put it this way ; your computer has 8GB of RAM , and 7GB are idle. Would you rather Chrome use 300MB and feel sluggish , or use 1GB and feel fast ? Google took the latter approach , with the read most people prefer performance. TL ; DR Ram is there to constitute used. , '' `` Because it 's not in reality a problem. The whole point is that it uses the ram so you can access your pages and other stuff speedily. Using the RAM is n't going to slacken down your computer unless you are running out , which you generally wo n't be on a modern system. Keep in mind also that if you are n't use the RAM , there 's really no point to it. , '' `` I had the same outlet and discovered certain things , as many have pointed out Chrome loads every tab individually so if one crashes the browser is still operable. But the actual memory consuming is how Chrome deals with the loaded pages. If you 're browsing for instant Reddit , every time you click on a link Chrome will load the new link but the previous page will still be load up in the memory , this is helpful for instance when you want to go back quickly because the page is already cached in your memory ; but it will overload your RAM with mostly unnecessary websites you may or may not go back. Some extension help you cut this. , '' `` Chrome opens up various iterations of Chrome helper for each chit you open. They finally became 64bit after dragging their feet on the Mac for the preceding few years. It 's still a memory hog with upwards of 1g of aries the ram. , '' `` Google secretly invested in aries. . . . practice too much memory ? Upgrade time ! 32GB here - it eats a lot of it , but I 've got plenty to spare ( 3 windows open. . . . about 15 tabs each ) , Chrome runs every tab `` like '' its ain browser , but it also does something similar for all your extensions.

I don't know, can someone help me out? Don't recall the lawn mower I used growing up having a spot for oil. 3) Does mowing the lawn first thing in the morning when the grass is damp really kill the grass? The issue with mowing wet grass is that it is super sticky and will stick to the underside of the lawn mower. Just make sure you don't cut it too short when it is hot and your grass should be OK. 4) If I leave the mower running when crossing the driveway (paved) does this hurt the lawn mower? (I was told I have a mulching mower, so this is bad for it) I have not heard of this. You'll be wasting gas, but I don't see how that would hurt the engine. 5) I was also told that I had to go slower, that running while mowing would be bad for the lawn mower. I was hoping to make it more of a work out. Not bad for the mower per se, but you have to give the blades time to cut the grass. If your yard is big enough your arms will get a decent workout from pushing the mower. 6) Do I need to use the bagging attachment? I haven't used it yet but I was told letting the cut grass fall on top of the mown grass was bad for the lawn. (I forget why) If you cut your grass often enough and the clippings are short enough you can let leave them on the grass. If they are too long you will end up burying your grass and it will die from lack of sun water. Rule of thumb: if the clippings pile up enough to annoy you when you look at it use the bag andor rake up the clippings by hand. 7) I try to cut it every 3-4 days otherwise I am not strong enough to push the mower or it stalls out. Sometimes when going up an incline I find myself having to push with my arms and my body, I will put the top of the handle against my ribs and push. Anything wrong with this? Try going slower with thicker grass, that should help with stalling. Also, try to go up the hill a little sideways versus straight up. Pushing with your body is not bad, but watch that your feet don't end up underneath the mower! 8) Is it bad to go back and forth, vacuum cleaner like in some spots? No, if you missed a small section you end up doing this. 9) how short should I actually be cutting it? Depends on the grass. Ask people around you that have the same type of grass. If you notice that it is starting to die in patches where it is too short, raise the mower the next time. I live in Florida and the grass is very thick. any advice would be sincerely appreciated PS how long will this lawn mower last? Depends on how great you take care of it and how cheaply it was made (much like a car). Keep it out of the rain and don't mow over rocks and big sticks (damages the blades) and it can last a long time., 2) Do I need to change the oil in the lawn mower like in the car? Yup. Check the manual for how often. Another bit of periodic maintenance will be to get the blade sharpened once or twice per year. 3) Does mowing the lawn first thing in the morning when the grass is damp really kill the grass? It'll just clog up the mower. Doubly so if you're mulching. 5) I was also told that I had to go slower, that running while mowing would be bad for the lawn mower.

A mulching mower, however, is supposed to keep chopping up the grass until it's small enough that it just falls down and makes fertilizer. Using the bag is still a good idea on days when the grass has gotten really long or it's still a bit damp. 7) I try to cut it every 3-4 days otherwise I am not strong enough to push the mower or it stalls out. Sometimes when going up an incline I find myself having to push with my arms and my body, I will put the top of the handle against my ribs and push. Anything wrong with this?

It was invented in Asia, so when it was adopted in Europe the pieces were'renamed'. So for example, the Indian game Chaturanga which is a precursor to modern chess has a piece called an Advisor, which is the equivalent of the chess Queen piece. As to why the piece was (re) named'Queen' when it was translated I have no idea, maybe because it was next to the king on the starting board? Edit: it's to its.,Arabs transferred the game from India through Persia to the west, in Arabic the names of the pieces are: - King Malek (King) - Queen Wazir (Which means literally Adviser, but it was equivalent to modern days Prime Minister) - Bishop Fil (Elephant) - Knight Hesan or Faras (Horse) - Rook [Rokh] (URL1) (It is a mythical creature in Arabic mythology that is like a very huge eagle that can carry an Elephant), in Modern Arabic however it is usually called Tabia (or Watch Tower) - Pawn Baidaq (foot soldier) So queen and bishop are European names that were not found in the original game and were added relatively recently. For more info check [Shatranj] (URL0).','From [Wiki] (URL2) it sounds as if the Queen used to be a relatively weaker piece till about 1500, and when she gained extra moves, it was derogatorilly called \"Mad Queen's Chess\"! The queen and bishop remained relatively weak until[15] between 1475 AD and 1500 AD, in either Spain, Portugal, France or Italy, the queen's and bishop's modern moves started and spread, making chess close to its modern form. This form of chess got such names as \"Queen's Chess\" or \"Mad Queen Chess\" (Italian alla rabiosa \"with the madwoman.[51] This led to much more value being attached to the previously minor tactic of pawn promotion.[20] Checkmate became easier and games could now be won in fewer moves....The modern move of the queen may have started as an extension of its older ability to once move two squares with jump, diagonally or straight.',The birth of the Chess Queen\" by Marilyn Yalom gives a great history of how the traditional male vizier role was usurped by a female during the middle ages through to the 1400 (?) because of a prevalence of female monarchs.

Their is a difference between status and rights. A women back then didn't have the freedom she had today but a high ranking medieval women still enjoyed a high status compared to serfs, commoners, etc.,When chess was modernized, it was done so mostly with the goal of speeding up the game. The original game with out bishops,a queen, and pawns only moving forward one square made the game too long. The modern chess pieces where added to speed up the game,and it was rebranded as a royal battle because modern chess originated in Europe. So the queen being the strongest piece on the board has nothing to do with how women were viewed at the time,the queen was made powerful to speed up the game.','You can win without a Queen, you cannot win without a King.','Pussy was, and will ever be the strongest weapon', \"Commenters pointing out that the queen was originally an'adviser piece' are correct but it is also interesting to know that it used to be the weakest backfield piece (able only to move one square diagonally in any direction).

There is a book on this called Birth of the Chess Queen: A History by Marilyn Yalom,Honestly I just thought the king was whipped, explains why he can only go one space at a time but his wife can go where she wants. Bloody double standards!','It is a modern miss-assumption that ancient women were not powerful. Women ran the Ottoman empire directly for [130 years] (URL4).

They were the explicit rulers in China, Egypt and the power behind the throne often enough to earn a chess piece.', \"I've posted this comment in a reply somewhere. It's about your assumption on the status of women. I'll repost it here, so you can take a look at it: Partially. It's very difficult to generalize the position of genders throughout history. So you could say that his assumption is too generic and simplified to be correct. It's indeed true that women were on occassion demonized and were usually considered to be inferior to men, but that doesn't mean that every women was disrespected. They were respected, often even revered, in their role as mothers and wives. What's even more, they could be considered to be equal to men in nearly every aspect. In the early to late middle ages, women were thought to be'undeveloped men'. Because they had no penis, it was often assumed that women were men whose penis had not grown outwards. This basically meant that gender wasn't defined by the sex of a person (like it is now). A women could be considered equal to men if she had proven herself equally capable in important matters, I think it was called the unisex model. Man and women were basically the same sex in this model, one was just more developped. So more often than not, gender was the defining feature not the biological sex. There are even many examples of women pretending to be men and being accepted because of it. So queens or a high-born ladies were considered to be equally capable of ruling. If they ruled wise, they proved themselves to be more like a man than a woman. In the later centuries of the Middle Ages in many Western regions widows were also allowed to take over the shop (the craft) of their husband. This differed from guild to guild, but if they were allowed to do this, they were nearly always treated as equals. In some cultures, important women were even allowed to marry other women. They would do everything an important man could and would do. In order to continue their line, they would be able to order a man to have sex with their wife. So in short, his assumption isn't all that rock solid.,I always thought of it as being symbolic rather than literal Queen piece does not mean the queen itself but the forces you would get from your in-laws. In same way bishop piece does not literally mean bishop, but the levy force from church vassals. Knights would be knights, rook would be someone with a strong hold (duke?) and pawn would be conscript soldiers.

It was invented in Asia , so when it was sweep up in Europe the pieces were'renamed '. So for example , the Indian game Chaturanga which is a precursor to modern chess has a piece called an consultant , which is the equivalent of the chess Queen piece. As to why the piece was ( re ) named'Queen ' when it was translated I have no idea , maybe because it was next to the king on the starting table ? Edit : it 's to its. , Arabs transferred the game from India through Persia to the west , in Arabic the names of the pieces are : - King Malek ( King ) - Queen Wazir ( Which means literally Adviser , but it was equivalent to modern days Prime Minister ) - Bishop Fil ( Elephant ) - Knight Hesan or Faras ( Horse ) - Rook [ Rokh ] ( URL1 ) ( It is a mythical creature in Arabic mythology that is like a very huge eagle that can carry an Elephant ) , in modern font Arabic however it is usually called Tabia ( or Watch Tower ) - Pawn Baidaq ( foot soldier ) So queen and bishop are European names that were not found in the original game and were added relatively recently. For more info deterrent [ Shatranj ] ( URL0 ). ' , 'From [ Wiki ] ( URL2 ) it sounds as if the Queen used to be a relatively weaker piece till about 1500 , and when she gained extra moves , it was derogatorilly called `` Mad Queen 's chess game '' ! The queen and bishop remained relatively weak until [ 15 ] between 1475 AD and 1500 AD , in either Spain , Portugal , France or Italy , the queen 's and bishop 's modern moves started and spread , making chess close to its modern form. This form of chess got such names as `` Queen 's bromus secalinus '' or `` Mad Queen bromus secalinus '' ( Italian alla rabiosa `` with the madwoman. [ 51 ] This led to much more economic value being attached to the previously minor tactic of pawn promotion. [ 20 ] checkmate became easier and games could now be won in fewer moves. . . . The new move of the queen may have started as an extension of its older ability to once move two squares with jump , diagonally or straight.

Their constitute a difference between status and rights. A woman back then did n't have the freedom she had today but a high ranking medieval woman still enjoyed a high status compared to serfs , commoners , etc. , When chess was modernized , it was done hence mostly with the goal of speeding up the game. The original game with out bishops , a queen , and pawns only moving forward one square earn the game too long. The modern chess game pieces where added to speed up the game , and it was rebranded as a royal battle because modern chess game originated in Europe. So the queen being the strongest piece on the board has nothing to do with how women were viewed at the clock time , the queen was made powerful to speed up the game. ' , 'You sack win without a Queen , you sack not win without a King. ' , 'Pussy was , and will ever be the strongest weapon ' , `` Commenters pointing out that the queen was originally an'adviser piece ' are correct but it is also interesting to know that it used to be the weakest backfield piece ( able only to move one square diagonally in any instruction ). It 's rise as the most dominant piece on the board coincides with the rules of striking female monarchs such as Elizabeth I. There is a book on this called Birth of the Chess Queen : A chronicle by Marilyn Yalom , Honestly I just thought the king was whipped , explains why he can only go one space at a time but his wife can go where she wants.

It 's about your effrontery on the status of women. I 'll repost it here , so you can deal a look at it : Partially. It 's very difficult to generalize the position of grammatical gender throughout history. So you could say that his assumption is too generic and simplified to exist correct. It 's indeed true that women be on occassion demonized and be usually considered to be inferior to men , but that does n't mean that every women was disrespected. They were observe , often even revered , in their role as mothers and wives. What 's even more , they could be considered to be equal to human race in nearly every aspect. In the early to late in between ages , women were thought to be'undeveloped men '. Because they had no penis , it was often put on that women were men whose penis had not grown outwards. This basically meant that sex was n't defined by the sex of a person ( like it is now ). A women could be study equal to men if she had proven herself equally capable in important matters , I think it was called the unisex model. Man and women were basically the same sex in this model , one was simply more developped. So more often than not , gender constitute the defining feature not the biological sex. There are yet many examples of women pretending to be men and being accepted because of it. So queens or a high-born ladies were deliberate to be equally capable of ruling. If they rein wise , they proved themselves to be more like a man than a woman. In the later centuries of the Middle Ages in many Western regions widows were also appropriate to take over the shop ( the craft ) of their husband. This differed from guild to guild , but if they were grant to do this , they were nearly always treated as equals. In some cultures , important women make up even allowed to marry other women. They would do everything an important valet de chambre could and would do. In order to continue their telephone line , they would be able to order a man to have sex with their wife. So in light , his assumption is n't all that rock solid. , I always thought of it as being symbolic rather than literal Queen musical composition does not mean the queen itself but the forces you would get from your in-laws. In same way bishop piece does not literally mean bishop , but the levy military group from church vassals. Knights would live knights , rook would live someone with a strong hold ( duke ? ) and pawn would live conscript soldiers.

One is positively charged and the other is negative and they attract each other strongly enough to be stuck together into a new material. (An example of this is Table Salt. The positively charged Na attracts the negatively charged Cl-.) A Covalent bond is when two atoms share a pair of electrons between them. Most materials you know of probably fit into this category better (like ethanol, [CH3CH2OH] (URL0), where the C's, H's, and O all share electrons with the atoms they're attached to.) Now that that's out of the way, there's actually a third big category of bonding: Metallic. This is what defines a metal in chemistry terms. They're similar to Covalent bonds, but also very different. In a Covalent bond, an atom only directly shares electrons with the atoms next to it.

We don't typically associate this with irony anymore, but any sort of parlor scene from a detective story is a good example. Verbal irony is sarcasm and is mostly performative in nature. An intended meaning is dramatically different from an expressed meaning. This is typically indicated by tone, gesture, and circumstance. Paralipsis (talking about something by saying you're not talking about it) is the easiest method of verbal irony to translate from performance to written word. Situational or cosmic irony is when the outcome of a series of events is different from the expected outcome.

Had Oz been a god, he would still have been unable to grant these gifts, but the situational would have been elevated to the cosmic.

By that I mean if we took every pixel and compared the color value of them while displaying the 1080p and the 720p, they would be different. This happens because a 720p screen can't display all the pixels from a 1080p image, so it resizes it into 720p. To figure out what colors to display for each pixel of the new image, it \"averages out\" the neighbour pixels of the big image. This process isn't perfect, you're taking several values and producing 1 value. There's loss of quality (comparing to the original 1080p). Now let's compare that to a native 720p photo. Let's imagine you took the exact same photo in 720p and 1080p. Your screen displays the 720p natively, but resizes the 1080p. In order to BE the same, the average-out process would need to produce the exact same 720p image (as in, every pixel having the same color value) as the original 720p photo. This can happen, but it's unlikely. It depends on too many factors (if the camera is the same, it also averaged-out when taking the 720p, for example). Now about LOOKING different. In my opinion, it can look better. The difference isn't usually that obvious, but 2 factors make it somewhat better to watch for example 4k on a 1080p screen.

But if you use a 4k camera to take a 1080p shot, or you take a 4k shot and resize it to 1080p, you have 4 pixels to figure out what the color for the new pixel should be. It should look closer to the natural thing. I have several 4k wallpapers that look better on my 1080p screen that 1080p wallpapers. The other factor is that it makes sense that cameras with higher resolutions will also have better overall quality.

Or for example people who own and use 20 megapixel cameras are in general more knowledgeable about photography than people with 1080p cameras.

As such, a good renderer can take advantage of subpixel information and output more detail, or at least interpret more detail from a 1080p video into a 720p display, since each pixel is made of 2-4 actual elements. (2-4 subpixels? I thought there were three primary colors!) Constraints of technology. A lot of older OLED displays had issues with blue elements burning out, so they doubled the size of the blue elements, and had every other \"pixel\" switch between a bluered and bluegreen combo.

The hydrogen ions come from reacting water with carbon dioxide to create carbonic acid which is H HCO3- when dissolved in water. Carbonic acid is a weak acid because HCO3- likes to hold on to H and prevent it from doing acidic action.

White blood cells work by basically eating pathogens, but if the infection is very wide spread the will eat until they gorge themselves until they burst. When they burst they release partially digested pathogens back into the system that are less infectious that what they originally ate. That is basically what pus is. Now this is like on a cellular level and cells are tiny. If you can see like a little bit of pus, like a zit, you can imagine that this is millions of white blood cell remains. Generally speaking if the \"war\" is going this wide spread, the infection is pretty serious. You have to imagine white blood cells like policemen picking up little pathogens here and there all over your body all the time, so when you have a large concentrated area of large infection like a wound or something like a clogged pour, especially one clogged with a foreign object like a tiny rock or piece of dust, your body sends tons of white blood cells into fight the long fight.

Is basically your access to information. The more information you can access that can relate to what you're trying to learn, the better you will be at learning. There is a limit to how much you can process at any given time though, so having this information curated can help, so try and focus the information you look at, while still understanding that generally the more information you have about anything, the easier it will be to learn. 2. The second bit is how you process the information given to you. Do you read it, listen to it, feel it. Is the information you are given easier to process as a whole, or as individual components. Do you need a visual model to make sense of what you're learning? Essentially its questions like this that make up \"learning styles\" or the idea that people process information differently, and have different degrees of proficiencies with different presentations of data. Your ability to understand how you learn at this phase, and your ability to convert data from visual to literary, to tactile, ect. Will greatly help in how quick this step will go. 3. This part is essentially your brain's health. Having a good memory, and using your brain frequently will help you learn faster, and preserve your mental health longer as you age. Playing memory games (and logic games in relation to [4., 5. on a daily basis will help how well you can allocate memory.

There is a lot that can be said on how to keep your physical brain healthier, but you're better off looking it up or asking a doctor if you have any real worries. 4. This part is essentially the start of logic and understanding. You are essentially trying to replicate the information you were given in your mind, while relating it to information you already know to form a stronger model. The better you become at relating some information to some other information the easier this step will get, and the faster you'll form the model. Being able to convert information via their learning styles as explained in [2.], will help you to create links easier and shape up a more rigid model. Again the best thing you can do for this step is to try and relate and translate information as much as possible to have stronger links. 5. Now that you have the model, you can begin to play with it. If you've learned a math concept, try and adapt it to a real world situation, and then analyze how parts of that concept hold up and what they relate to. Try and to change parts of the model to see how it breaks or hold up to get a better understanding of it. Essentially challenge what you've learned to make sure if still fits with all other information you have in your brain, and maybe even discover holes in your understanding. This step is essentially reflection, where you ask your self questions to see if you can get a better understanding of we it is you're learning. 6. Finally being able to express what you've learned to someone else is key to being a good learner.

{"original_text": "Your brain directly is saying it is happening not outside stimulus.','kinda leads one to question the very nature of reality, doesn't it? Here's my very round-about, philosophical answer that touches on many different topics to deliver a point. In my opinion, during daytime, your brain is also unable to tell the difference between what is out there, and what it thinks is out there...what is happening, vs what your brain thinks is happening. So, in my view, the issue of gullibility, blind faith, or inaccuracy is not just restricted to dream time. For example, many people have a hard time differentiating between what has happened (memory) and what is happening (Now). To me, real means that I feel it, that I experience sensations that are strong, and that what I am experiencing, and my state of being, mirrors and matches what I believe is happening. And when my brain retrieves any memory, it also retrieves the emotional state that was associated with the memory. So when I remember, that memory automatically becomes more real. And those memories can heighten my arousal, and excitement, and add to what is happening now. What is actually happening right now? From what perspective, what is happening right now is that I am perceiving what I perceive, and that is real, if only because it is what I am perceiving. However, what I feel, experience and know to be real doesn't actually have to conform or have any consistent correlation with any external reality. So we all seem to be forever adding layers onto right now, and most likely actively ignoring or writing off massive amounts of information as irrelevant for no reason other than that other things seem more important, and real. When you are hungry, your brain remembers things that satisfied that desire. You will be biased to push for the things you have used before. If you've used toast a lot before, then toast has the most relevant, emotionally affective, and therefore real attraction, so your brain decides 'Toast it is!\" When you decide to make toast, your brain wants to help, so it remembers all the other times you've made toast. And 99 of all of this is likely happening sub-consciously. They say that the conscious mind, the voice you hear in your head, or the thoughts that you actually can notice happening form 40 bits of information, compared to the subconscious ability to process 40 billion bits of info. Since Reddit is so interested in relationships, I'll give an example that shows how this whole systematic dynamic can work against you: Woman A is with Man A. They fight. The conflict escalates. She gets emotional. She says something he finds offensive. He gets emotional. He advances threateningly. She gets more scared, wants the fight to end, but sticks to her points. The points continue to offend him. He hits her. the fight ends. That relationship ends. Fast forward a bit. Woman A is with Man B. They enter conflict. She gets emotional. He gets emotional. The conflict escalates into offensiveness. She doesn't want to be hit, but she wants the fight to be over. Her brain problem solves the situation, and decides, that, instead of being neutralized by him, she will neutralize him. So she hits him. The fight is over. The neuroscience suggests, that prior to striking out, she remembered being hit, felt all the feelings again, and this stimulus was enough to impel her to strike out first. The irony is that her brain was just trying to help her have a good conflict by remembering all the other times she had been in a conflict. We all use the word immature, to represent an incomplete picture of reality, and being ineffective and powerless to achieve the highest desired outcome. A baby is immature, and develops a pattern, belief, or faith that their cry causes milk to appear. We all know and despise people who still, to this day, use crying, demands, begging, manipulation, and anger to try and get their milk. Science is beginning to show how the motherbaby bonding during breast feeding releases endorphins and oxytocin, so the mother is literally driven, by a desire to feel good, to respond to the babies crys, and initiate breast feeding. Does the baby being angry, fretting, and upset cause the mother to give milk? It does alert her to the need, and the opportunity to bond. It does not motivate her to initiate breastfeeding. The breastfeeding itself motivates her to feed, because it is rewarding. People who primarily use distress, upset, anger, and power to control others, have just not seem, or understood the benefit that others derive from having a mutual needs-meeting experience. So your brain is never fully believing accurately, neither does it care. What is important to you is how you feel, what is happening, why, what you want to do, and how you think you can do it. And 99 of that is imaginative mental gymnastics. aka If A then B? well, the ability to perceive the exact nature of any proposition is, in my view, tenuous at best, so my conclusion is that 99 of life is taken by faith, or belief anyway, once we come to realize the nature of how the brain creates facts, and believes them to be true. ie: confirmation bias is real, because it feels real, and requires little to no external validation or confirmation TLDR: Real is based on feeling.

' , 'kinda leads one to question the very nature of reality , does n't it ? Here 's my very round-about , philosophical answer that extend to on many different topics to deliver a point. In my opinion , during daytime , your brain is besides unable to tell the difference between what is out there , and what it thinks is out there. . . what is go on , vs what your brain thinks is go on. So , in my view , the issue of gullibility , blind faith , or inaccuracy is not just limit to dream time. For example , many people have a hard time differentiating between what has happened ( retention ) and what is happening ( Now ). To me , real means that I feel it , that I experience champion that are strong , and that what I am experiencing , and my state of being , mirrors and matches what I believe is happening. And when my brain retrieves any retention , it also retrieves the emotional state that was associated with the retention. So when I remember , that memory automatically becomes more than real. And those memories can heighten my arousal , and excitement , and add to what is bechance now. What is actually happening right now ? From what perspective , what is happening right now is that I am perceive what I perceive , and that is real , if only because it is what I am perceive. However , what I feel , experience and know to be real does n't actually cause to conform or cause any consistent correlation with any external reality. So we all seem to be forever adding layers onto right now , and most likely actively ignoring or writing off massive amounts of information as irrelevant for no reason other than that other things seem more significant , and real. When you are thirsty , your brain remembers things that satisfied that desire. You will be bias to push for the things you have used before. If you 've used toast a fate before , then toast has the most relevant , emotionally affective , and therefore real attraction , so your brain decides 'Toast it is ! '' When you decide to make toast , your brain wants to help , so it remembers all the other times you 've made toast. And 99 of all of this is probable happening sub-consciously. They say that the conscious mind , the voice you try in your head , or the thoughts that you actually can notice happening form 40 bits of information , compared to the subconscious ability to process 40 billion bits of info. Since Reddit is so interested in relationships , I 'll give an example that shows how this whole systematic moral force can work against you : Woman A is with Man A. They push. The battle escalates. She dumbfound emotional. She says something he come up offensive. He bugger off emotional. He pass on threateningly. She sire more scared , wants the fight to end , but sticks to her points. The head continue to offend him. He bump off her. the fight remnant. That family relationship ends. fasting forward a bit. Woman A is with Man vitamin b complex. They enroll conflict. She gets excited. He gets worked up. The battle escalates into offensiveness. She does n't want to be hit , but she require the fight to be over. Her brain problem solves the situation , and decides , that , instead of being neutralized by him , she leave neutralize him. So she gain him. The battle is over. The neuroscience suggests , that prior to striking out , she remembered being hit , felt all the feelings again , and this stimulus was enough to impel her to strike out st. The irony is that her brain was just trying to help her have a good conflict by remember all the other times she had been in a conflict. We all use the word immature , to represent an uncomplete picture of reality , and being ineffective and powerless to achieve the highest desired outcome. A baby is unripe , and develops a pattern , belief , or faith that their cry causes milk to appear. We all know and despise people who still , to this day , use crying , demands , begging , manipulation , and anger to test and get their milk. Science is beginning to show how the motherbaby bonding during breast alimentation releases endorphins and oxytocin , so the mother is literally driven , by a desire to feel good , to respond to the babies crys , and initiate breast alimentation. Does the baby being angry , fretting , and upset drive the mother to give milk ? It does alert her to the need , and the opportunity to bond. It manage not motivate her to initiate breastfeeding. The breastfeeding itself incite her to feed , because it is rewarding. People who primarily use distress , upset , anger , and power to control others , have just not seem , or understood the welfare that others derive from having a mutual needs-meeting experience. So your brain is never fully believing accurately , neither does it wish. What is important to you is how you feel , what is bechance , why , what you want to do , and how you think you can do it. And 99 of that embody imaginative mental gymnastics. aka If A then group b ? well , the ability to perceive the exact nature of any proposition is , in my view , tenuous at best , so my conclusion is that 99 of life is taken by faith , or belief anyway , once we come to realize the nature of how the brain creates facts , and believes them to be true. ie : confirmation bias live real , because it feels real , and requires little to no external validation or confirmation TLDR : Real live based on feeling. Most feeling are self-perpetuated , and self-created anyway , so people are often not motivated to stop believing small perspectives unless the external situation makes it impossible to maintain their internal stasis. IE : rich people who trust they are rich because of their hard work : move them to africa , and they would be less able to feel , and thus trust that work : monetary wealth. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "Imagine your camera sensor as a series of square pipes arrayed in a grid. You drop this grid of pipes down on top of a wet painting, and then you mix up the paint inside each tube in the grid until it is a uniform color, then you flip the painting and what falls through the tubes hits hits a fresh piece of canvas and the paint that hits the canvas makes your new image. Now, there's a couple easy ways to make the original and your new painting look closer to one another. The first is to start with a bigger painting so that you can use more pipes so the detail is spread over more pipes, or the second option, to use smaller pipes so that detail is preserved by not mixing as much paint in each. Of course, you can do both of these at the same time when cost and size aren't a factor. With a bigger painting, you've got more area for more pipes, and the absolute limit of quality is higher, but we like our cameras tiny, so that path is only used when size is not an issue and quality is most important. With smaller pipes, you're smearing smaller areas of your painting together in each one. This results in a higher fidelity result, closer to the original image, but our theoretical pipes can only get so small before there's no paint that can fit into the pipes anymore, and all you're doing is smashing pipe edges into the painting. Just like our imagined physical pipes have edges themselves, camera sensors have areas that aren't recording the light hitting them. The new thing with cameras is \"HDR.\" So, if your eyes simultaneously are seeing something pure black as a \"0\" and at the same time pure white as \"100\" most cameras can only record things between 30 and 70. Anything below 30 is recorded as pure black, and anything above 70 is pure white. If the area is too bright, the shutter only stays open enough that most of the details of the image fall in the 30-70 range. If it's too dark, it stays open longer while the light hitting the sensor reaches the 30-70 range. So, to get all 0-100 that your eyes see (or even beyond) the camera can take two photos back-to-back, one with a short shutter speed and one with the slow speed. Anything that comes out as too dark in the fast speed will be replaced with the slow-speed picture and anything too bright in the slow picture will be replaced by the same area in the fast picture.

Going by [NASA's data] (URL0), visible light tops out with a wavelength of 700 nanometers. So your pipes, even though their walls are infinitesimally thin, still need openings that big to let the light through them. Because of that, your perfect sensor would have to be 1.344mm x 0.756mm to capture a \"full-HD\" resolution image. That's the limit of where physics lets you go with sensor size.

Anyway, the reason A440 will sound different on a piano than a guitar is because of timbre. This is essentially the overtone series put to work. Different instruments will have different overtones to create their characteristic sound. Furthermore, if you are tech savvy and have a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) you can manipulate these overtones to either make a guitar sound like a piano, or create whole new fictional instruments based on acoustic ones we already have.

URL0 ' , `` Dunno if I can answer your question directly but I 'm a music major undergrad remove beginning audio. Basically all we talk about is the science of audio and how we can manipulate it. Sound , or upright yet , specific tones vibrate a certain amount of times in one second. For example the tone A440 will vacillate 440 times in one second. Beyond that though are overtones and partials ( basically the same thing ) where you will cause other tones sort of inside the principal tone. It 's easier to explain with a drawing off , but a quick google search of the overtone series should give you plenty of info. in any event , the reason A440 will sound different on a piano than a guitar is because of timbre. This is essentially the overtone series pose to work. Different instruments will have dissimilar overtones to create their characteristic sound. Furthermore , if you are tech discernment and have a DAW ( Digital Audio Workstation ) you can manipulate these overtones to either make a guitar sound like a piano , or create whole new fictional instruments based on acoustic ones we already have. They bequeath do this for movies based on sci-fi books and the like. Someone else correct me if I 'm awry. To be honest I 've own seven exams this week , it 's Friday , and I 'm high af. , '' `` relative frequency. The rate and fluctuation of which your ' auditory cortex is inundated with sound hitting it set the way you interpret it. If I shoot something once it 's a sharp whack , but shoot it 1000 times per second it 's a steady tone. Just like how a dog whistle tin not be perceived by humans , but dogs with more superb hearing tin register the sound which basically is n't real to humans. , The simple answer is just that waves are incredible complex and the auditory sensation you describe look nothin like the sine waves one thinks about when thinking about waves. Just [ look ] ( URL1 ) at the difference between a blocked guitar string and a cymbal crash. ' , 'There are different relative frequency , tones , pitches , and densities very much like the variety in types of waveforms.
