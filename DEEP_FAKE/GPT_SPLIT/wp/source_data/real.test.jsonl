The US military took this requirement very seriously, burying the body within hours. \"Traditional procedures for Islamic burial were followed,\" an official said. Religious rites were carried out on the deck of a US aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson. The body, shrouded in a white sheet and placed in a weighted bag, was then positioned on a flat board, tipped up, and eased into the Arabian Sea. This occurred at 0600GMT, approximately 12 hours after the firefight during which Osama Bin Laden was shot in the head. After this first shot, reports ABC News' The Blotter, he was shot again, to make sure that he was dead. The body was then flown to Afghanistan and Bin Laden's identity was confirmed. Officials say a DNA sample was taken that matched that of several other family members. Some sources say facial recognition technology was also used. From Afghanistan, the body was, it appears, flown to the USS Carl Vinson. \"A military officer read prepared religious remarks, which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker,\" a US defence official said. According to UK-based Imam Dr Abduljalil Sajid, Chairman of the Muslim Council for Religious Racial Harmony, four key steps need to be followed: There is no necessity for an imam to be present, he says, but the procedures should be carried out by Muslims at least one of whom \"knows the minimum basic Muslim law of burial.\" Whether any such person was present is impossible to know, he says, based on the limited information provided. But he also questions whether sea burial was appropriate in this case. It is correct to carry out a burial at sea when someone dies on a sea journey, he says, but in this case there was no sound reason for it. The US authorities could surely have found someone - a member of the extensive Bin Laden family, or even one of the many supporters of his \"evil\" ideology - who would have been prepared to give the body a proper burial, he argues. His words were echoed by Mohammed Qudah, a professor of Islamic law at the University of Jordan, who told the Associated Press news agency that burying Bin Laden at sea was not forbidden if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial. But he went on: \"It's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive Bin Laden's body.\" The agency also quoted Dubai's grand mufti Mohammed al-Qubaisi, saying that sea burials were permissible only in extraordinary circumstances, adding: \"This is not one of them.\" \"If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: You dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it,\" he said.

They are six points off the Premier League summit after losing two consecutive home league matches for the first time since December 2008, and have lost ground to Arsenal and Tottenham, who are in third and second respectively. City know the gap is not insurmountable, having been eight points behind Manchester United in April 2012 before snatching the Premier League title on the final day. But they are 11 points worse off than Leicester and Tottenham during this 17-game period and need to find form quickly. City will point towards the penalty as a key moment against a Tottenham side who have not won a top-flight title since 1961.

Media playback is not supported on this device Manchester City were absolutely furious at Mark Clattenburg's decision to penalise Sterling and you could understand why. The England forward had turned his back as he jumped to block Danny Rose's cross, with the ball hitting him as he was looking the other way. Former Wales and Leicester midfielder Robbie Savage told BBC Radio 5 live: \"I think that is harsh, very, very harsh. It has hit him on the elbow.\" However, in a match of few chances, City should ask questions defensively as they levelled before leaving themselves wide open seven minutes from time for Eriksen, on his 24th birthday, to win the match. England manager Roy Hodgson was at the Etihad and would have welcomed the earlier news of scoring returns for Arsenal's Danny Welbeck and Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge. In the first two games of the day, six of the nine goals scored had been netted by English players and his options before Euro 2016 were further demonstrated in Manchester as Kane scored his 16th Premier League goal of the season. The 11.9km covered by England's 19-year-old midfielder Dele Alli was more than all but one of Manchester City's side, as he continues to impress, while compatriot Eric Dier, 22, was solid in the holding midfield role. Another England forward, Sterling, was quiet for the most part for City, although he did almost break the deadlock with a volley that was bravely blocked by Rose early on. Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini told BBC Sport: \"It was a penalty that referee Mark Clattenburg wanted to sign for and he gave the sign. It was absolutely the wrong decision, it hit the back of Raheem Sterling then his elbow. Sterling was not even seeing the ball. It was the same referee in the first game where there were two clear goals in offside and we lost 4-1. \"It was the key moment that decided thee game; before that they did not shoot towards our goal and did not have any chances.

The court hearing was told that on 9 October, 2013, a car driven by Gavin Hughes was stopped in north Belfast, and when the vehicle was stopped a black plastic bag was located on the passenger seat. The bag contained five compact cubes of cocaine which amounted to 1.27 kilos of the Class A drug.

{"original_text": "Dubbed \"carbon farming,\" researchers say the idea is economically competitive with high-tech carbon capture and storage projects. But critics say the idea could be have unforeseen, negative impacts including driving up food prices. The research has been published in the journal Earth System Dynamics. Jatropha curcas is a plant that originated in Central America and is very well adapted to harsh conditions including extremely arid deserts. It is already grown as a biofuel in some parts of the world because its seeds can produce oil. In this study, German scientists showed that one hectare of jatropha could capture up to 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. The researchers based their estimates on trees currently growing in trial plots in Egypt and in the Negev desert. \"The results are overwhelming,\" said Prof Klaus Becker, from the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart. \"There was good growth, a good response from these plants. I feel there will be no problem trying it on a much larger scale, for example ten thousand hectares in the beginning,\" he said. According to the researchers a plantation that would cover three percent of the Arabian desert would absorb all the CO2 produced by cars and trucks in Germany over a 20 year period. The scientists say that a critical element of the plan would be the availability of desalination facilities. This means that initially, any plantations would be confined to coastal areas. They are hoping to develop larger trials in desert areas of Oman or Qatar. Prof Becker says that unlike other schemes that just offset the carbon that people produce, the planting of jatropha could be a good, short term solution to climate change. \"I think it is a good idea because we are really extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - and it is completely different between extracting and preventing.\" According to the scientist's calculations the costs of curbing carbon dioxide via the planting of trees would be between 42 and 63 euros per tonne. This makes it competitive with other techniques, such as the more high tech carbon capture and storage (CCS). A number of countries are currently trialling this technology but it has yet to be deployed commercially. Growing jatropha not only soaks up CO2 but has other benefits. The plants would help to make desert areas more habitable, and the plant's seeds can be harvested for biofuel say the researchers, providing an economic return. \"Jatropha is ideal to be turned into biokerosene - it is even better than biodiesel,\" said Prof Becker. But other experts in this area are not convinced. They point to the fact that in 2007 and 2008 large numbers of jatropha trees were planted for biofuel, especially in Africa. But many of these ventures ended in tears, as the plants were not very successful in coping with dry conditions. Lucy Hurn is the biofuels campaign manager for the charity, Actionaid. She says that while jatropha was once seen as the great, green hope the reality was very different. \"When jatropha was introduced it was seen as a miracle crop, it would grow on scrubland or marginal land,\" she said. \"But there are often people who need marginal land to graze their animals, they are getting food from that area - we wouldn't class the land as marginal.\" She pointed out that jatropha is highly toxic and can pollute the land it is grown on, even in a desert. And she also had concerns about the fairness of the idea. \"It is still somebody else's land.

{"original_text": "Philae, the first spacecraft to land on a comet, was dropped on to the surface of Comet 67P by its mothership, Rosetta, last November. It worked for 60 hours before its solar-powered battery ran flat. The comet has since moved nearer to the Sun and Philae has enough power to work again, says the BBC's science correspondent Jonathan Amos. An account linked to the probe tweeted the message, \"Hello Earth! Can you hear me?\" On its blog, Esa said Philae had contacted Earth, via Rosetta, for 85 seconds on Saturday in the first contact since going into hibernation in November. \"Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35C and has 24 watts available,\" said Philae project manager, Dr Stephan Ulamec. Scientists say they now waiting for the next contact. Esa's senior scientific advisor, Prof Mark McCaughrean, told the BBC: \"It's been a long seven months, and to be quite honest we weren't sure it would happen - there are a lot of very happy people around Europe at the moment.\" Philae was carrying large amounts of data that scientists hoped to download once it made contact again, he said. \"I think we're optimistic now that it's awake that we'll have several months of scientific data to pore over,\" he added. This is one of the most astonishing moments in space exploration and the grins on the faces of the scientists and engineers are totally justified, says BBC science editor David Shukman. For the first time, we will have a hitchhiker riding on a comet and describing what happens to a comet as it heats up on its journey through space, he adds. Philae is designed to analyse the ice and rocky fragments that make up the comet. Prof Monica Grady from the Open University told the BBC that scientists now hoped to be able to carry out experiments to see whether comets were the source of life on Earth. Comets contained a lot of water and carbon, and \"these are the same sorts of molecules responsible for getting life going,\" she said. \"What we're trying to find out is whether the building blocks of life, in terms of water and carbon-bearing molecules, were actually delivered to Earth from comets.\" When Philae first sent back images of its landing location, researchers could see it was in a dark ditch. The Sun was obscured by a high wall, limiting the amount of light that could reach the robot's solar panels. Scientists knew they only had a limited amount of time - about 60 hours - to gather data before the robot's battery ran flat. But the calculations also indicated that Philae's mission might not be over for good when the juice did eventually run dry. The comet is currently moving in towards the Sun, and the intensity of light falling on Philae, engineers suggested, could be sufficient in time to re-boot the machine. And so it has proved. Scientists must now hope they can get enough power into Philae to carry out a full range of experiments. One ambition not fulfilled before the robot went to sleep was to try to drill into the comet, to examine its chemical make-up. One attempt was made last year, and it failed. A second attempt will now become a priority. Return of the plucky robot Philae's extraordinary opportunity Rosetta: The whole story The Rosetta probe took 10 years to reach 67P, and the lander - about the size of a washing-machine - bounced at least a kilometre when it touched down. Before it lost power, Philae sent back images of its surroundings that showed it was in a dark location with high walls blocking sunlight from reaching its solar panels. Its exact location on the duck-shaped comet has since been a mystery. Esa had a good idea of where it was likely to be, down to a few tens of metres, but could not get Rosetta close enough to the comet to acquire conclusive pictures. Continued radio contact should now allow precise coordinates to be determined, correspondents say. Comet 67P is currently 205 million km (127 million miles) from the Sun, and getting closer. It is due in August to get as close as 186 million km, before then sweeping back out into the outer Solar System. As it nears the sun, the comet will warm and its ices will melt.

Rachel Williams from Newport, who suffered 18 years of domestic violence at the hands of her late husband, Darren Williams, said: \"If you don't deal with the perpetrator, who's the problem, all they'll do is go on to the next victim.\" In 2011, after Ms Williams filed for divorce, her husband burst into her hair salon armed with a sawn-off shotgun and shot her in the leg, before hanging himself in woodland. Six weeks later, as she was recovering in hospital, the body of her 16-year-old son, Jack, was found hanged in the same spot. Ms Williams, 44, who has since remarried, said her former husband would have benefited from the scheme. \"He was a control freak and he needed his actions addressing,\" she said. \"We've got to try and change the mindset of the perpetrator and hold them accountable for their actions.\" One woman who survived a \"hellish five-year marriage to a physically, emotionally and financially abusive man\" said she did not believe the Drive scheme would be effective and it would be better to spend the money on support for victims. \"The majority - although not all - of serial perpetrators of domestic violence do it out of choice, not because they have drug, alcohol, social or financial problems,\" she said. \"They will use this Drive scheme as a way to avoid prison and they will deliberately make it look as though they are reforming until they are'signed off' and deemed safe. \"They will then simply find another victim and go back to how they were.\" Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said there was \"no evidence - here or abroad - that therapy programmes for violent partners work.\" She added: \"On the face of it, it seems like a worthy thing to do.

They only have PS34 million from the government, which is static and won't go up,\" she said. \"We told them right at the beginning, this was never going to be a commercially viable project - but nobody listened to us.\" BBC Radio Bristol politics reporter Pete Simson Could Bristol really be left with a brand new public transport network, but no company willing to run it? The idea was always for Metrobus to be run without subsidies, using shiny new buses with clean fuel. Unfortunately, it would appear bus companies view this as simply too risky, after all, they want to make a profit. With huge swathes of Bristol's roads currently being dug up to build Metrobus, the need for a deal becomes ever more pressing. Time will tell if this is merely another teething problem, or a hugely costly mistake. Commuters are currently enduring roadworks associated with the scheme in the city centre, on the M32 and various other locations in South Gloucestershire. The scheme was devised by the West of England Partnership (WEP), an alliance between the four councils in Bristol, Bath, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset. It involves three routes: Ashton Vale to Temple Meads, Cribbs Causeway via Emersons Green to the city centre and the South Bristol link between the A370 Long Ashton bypass and Hengrove Park. It will provide an express bus service on 31 miles (50km) of segregated bus-ways and bus lanes. The WEP said Bristol, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset council were \"actively negotiating\" with bus operators and such discussions were commercially sensitive. A spokeswoman said: \"We have always been clear that the aim is that the MetroBus services are run entirely on a commercial basis via a quality partnership scheme that sets minimum standards for frequencies, quality of vehicles and maximum fares, supported by a voluntary partnership agreement with one or more operator. \"Of course should negotiations not be successful, we have a range of back up plans which could include formal contracts to run all or some services on a contracted basis. \"This might require the use of public money following a competitive procurement process, but this would depend on the situation when negotiations conclude - which all parties agree should be in about three-four weeks' time.\" First Bus, Wessex and the Bath Bus Company RAPT were said to be in the running for the contract.", "text_perturb": "Negotiations over who will run the PS200m Metrobus network have stalled as bus companies are loath to run the service on a completely commercial basis.

He was one of the most colourful characters in the British game and has since enjoyed success at Inter Milan and Real Madrid before returning to London. BBC Sport looks at some of Mourinho's best quotes and controversies. On becoming Chelsea manager for the first time: \"I have top players and I'm sorry, we have a top manager. Please do not call me arrogant because what I say is true. I'm European champion, I'm not one out of the bottle, I think I'm a special one.\" On bird flu: \"I'm feeling a lot of pressure with the swan in Scotland. It's not far and I'm more scared of the swan than of football. What's football compared to life? A swan with bird flu, for me that's a drama.\" On drinking wine with then-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: \"After the game, after the press conference, we were together in my office. The wine we were drinking was very bad and he was complaining. When we go to Old Trafford it's my birthday and I will go with a beautiful bottle of Portuguese wine.\" Media playback is not supported on this device On eggs: \"Omelettes, eggs. No eggs, no omelettes. And it depends on the quality of the eggs in the supermarket. They are class one, two or three and some are more expensive than others and some give you better omelettes. When the class one eggs are not available you have a problem.\" On being sacked: \"If the club decide to sack me because of bad results that's part of the game. If it happens I will be a millionaire and get another club a couple of months later.\" On Chelsea's pitch: \"Sometimes you see beautiful people with no brains. Sometimes you have ugly people who are intelligent, like scientists. Our pitch is a bit like that. From the top it's a disgrace but the ball rolls at normal speed.\" On playing Chelsea, while manager of Real Madrid: \"If I play them in the Champions League, I want to go there and kill them - that's my message,\" Then-Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez: \"If Chelsea are naive and pure then I'm Little Red Riding Hood.\" Then-Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock: \"My wife will be glad about Mourinho coming to Bramall Lane because he's a good looking swine, isn't he?\" Career record up to 1 June 2013 Former Chelsea striker Eidur Gudjohnsen: \"When Mourinho says training will last one-and-a-half hours it will never last a second longer.\" Then-Chelsea striker Didier Drogba's reaction to Mourinho leaving the London club: \"I find Jose's'eviction' hard to take. I could not see the blow coming so brutally. \"It changes an awful lot of things. I am in the sort of nervous state I've never dreamed about before. Many of us used to play first and foremost for the manager. Now we need to forget those feelings and find another source of motivation.\" Ian Holloway on Mourinho's sacking by Chelsea: \"Football has gone mad. He is one of the best managers in the world. I'm devastated. I was learning from him from afar. He makes you feel 25-foot tall and I'm going to sorely miss him.\" Barcelona vice-president Carles Vilarrubi on Mourinho's return to Chelsea: \"It is not good for English football. If Mourinho behaves like he did in Spain it will only be an unhappy relationship. In his three years in Spain he only created disagreements and arguments. I am happy he is leaving and so is everyone in Spanish football.\" February 2005: After Chelsea's 2-1 defeat against Barcelona in the first leg of their last-16 clash, Mourinho wrongly accused Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard of visiting referee Anders Frisk at half-time. Mourinho is fined PS8,900, given a two-match touchline ban and called an \"enemy of football\" by the head of Uefa's referees committee Volker Roth. March 2005: Mourinho is fined PS5,000 after he alleged Manchester United players were guilty of \"fault and fault and cheat and cheat\" during a Carling Cup semi-final clash. June 2005: Mourinho is fined PS200,000, which is reduced to PS75,000 on appeal, for meeting then-Arsenal player Ashley Cole, without his club's consent. January to March 2010: While manager of Inter Milan, Mourinho is fined three times in as many months by the Italian Football Federation.

{"original_text": "Even with the usual caveats attached to opinion polls, a 65 to 17 majority for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK suggests little room for doubt. The British and Irish governments have both made it clear they don't think now is the time to hold a border poll. Sinn Fein are campaigning for a poll and the DUP have discussed, in their words, calling Sinn Fein's bluff. But after weeks of controversy about flags and national identity, politicians' claims about Catholic unionism, and a census showing a growing number identifying themselves as Northern Irish, what lies behind that headline figure in the Spotlight opinion poll is particularly revealing. Not surprisingly, more than 90 of those who identify themselves as Protestants told the pollsters they wanted to stay in the UK. But on the other side of the religious divide, a substantial 38 of Catholics also favoured remaining within the UK - three percentage points more than the number who backed a united Ireland. While only 5 of Protestants don't intend to vote or haven't decided which option they would pick, more than a quarter of Catholics are either undecided or not planning on voting. As avowed believers in a united Ireland and the party running a border poll campaign, Sinn Fein might be surprised to learn that nearly a quarter of those who identified themselves as Sinn Fein voters - 23 - told the pollsters they would back the status quo in a border poll. More than half of SDLP supporters - 56 - also said they would opt to stay in the UK if a poll was held tomorrow. Prime Minister David Cameron said the survey for the BBC Spotlight programme on the potential outcome of a border poll should lift the spirits of all those who value Northern Ireland's place within the union. The results of the 2011 census, released in December last year, revealed that just over a fifth of the population considers itself \"Northern Irish.\" That posed a political puzzle - in a border poll would these people tick a British or an Irish box? Well, those who identified themselves as \"Northern Irish\" for the BBC Spotlight poll back staying in the UK by a significant margin - 72 to just 7. At the DUP conference late last year Peter Robinson hinted that his party hopes to make inroads into Catholic unionist territory. Since then commentators have expressed the view that the union flag dispute and the ensuing protests make this a pipe dream. The Spotlight survey suggests the main parties have a long way to go to reach across the religious divide. Those identifying themselves as DUP supporters are 97 Protestant, while UUP supporters are 99 Protestant. Those backing Sinn Fein are 99 Catholic, while SDLP supporters are 92 Catholic. Alliance, as an identifiably centre ground party, is the one bucking the trend - with 51 Protestant backing and 36 Catholic support. Alliance's support for a \"designated days\" flag flying policy at Belfast City Hall stirred controversy and led to attacks on the party's offices and a death threat against its only MP, Naomi Long. However the Spotlight poll suggests raising the flag on 18 designated days is the most popular compromise across the community as a whole. Of those interviewed, 44 backed the designated days policy, in comparison to 35 wanting the union flag raised throughout the year. A further 10 told the pollsters no flag should be flown at the City Hall, while only 2 opted for the union flag flying alongside the Irish tricolour. Although designated days was the most popular option, flag flying polarises unionists and nationalists. 73 of unionists want the union flag up at Belfast City Hall 365 days a year, while 64 of nationalists support the 18 day policy. Even though the designated days compromise got more support than any other option, just over half of those interviewed thought the union flag protestors were right to take to the streets when Belfast City Council made its decision in early December. This result may reflect some people's belief in the right to protest, even if they don't back the aim of a particular demonstration. However this support appears to have dwindled sharply during the course of January, as by the time the Spotlight survey was carried out more than three quarters of interviewees wanted the protests to stop. They told the pollsters this was for a variety of reasons, the main ones being the violence sparked by some protests and the disruptive impact on business.

{"original_text": "It may be their signature pose, but how and why the birds perch on one limb has been a longstanding puzzle. Now, a team from the US has shown that flamingos employ no active muscular effort when they're unipedal, meaning they are also expending less energy. A passive mechanism is engaged in the one-legged position, allowing flamingos to stand proud while having a doze. Previously, researchers had wondered whether the one-legged position might help reduce muscle fatigue, as the birds alternated from standing on one leg to the other. Other teams have proposed that this behaviour helps regulate body temperature. Now, Prof Young-Hui Chang, from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) in Atlanta, and Lena H Ting, of Atlanta's Emory University, have uncovered the mechanical secrets behind this impressive trick. The researchers conducted several experiments with both live and dead birds. Amazingly, they found that flamingo cadavers could be made to stand one-legged without any external support. In a paper published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, they describe this phenomenon as a \"passive gravitational stay mechanism.\" \"If you look at the bird from the front, while they're standing on one leg, the foot is directly beneath the body which means that their leg is angled inward. That's the pose you have to strike in order to engage the stay mechanism,\" Prof Chang told BBC News. However, dead birds cannot stand unsupported on two legs, suggesting a greater role for active muscle force in this posture: \"If you tilt it to the vertical, like you would if you were standing on two legs, the whole thing disengages,\" said the director of the Comparative Neuromechanics Laboratory at Georgia Tech. The researchers also studied live birds, and showed that when they were standing one-legged and resting, they hardly moved at all - underlining the stability of this passive position. However, the birds did sway somewhat when the one-legged posture was combined with an activity, such as grooming or calling out. Prof Chang said the underlying anatomical apparatus that enables the passive posture was not yet understood - this is the next step in the team's research. But he explained that the phenomenon did not involve the limb joints locking. \"A lock would imply that it's fixed in both directions. What we found is that it's fixed in one direction, but flexible in the other direction, so we call it a'stay' rather than a'lock'. It's more akin to a doorstop,\" he told me. Dr Matthew Anderson, an experimental psychologist who specialises in animal behaviour at St Joseph's University in Philadelphia, described the team's results as a \"significant step forward.\" The researcher, who was not involved with the latest study, added: \"They begin to answer the question of how flamingos are able to rest on one leg. Importantly, these authors do not examine when and where flamingos actually utilise the behaviour in question, and thus this paper does not really address the issue of why flamingos rest while on one leg.\" Dr Anderson's own research suggests that the birds adopt the unusual posture in order to conserve heat.

{"original_text": "The former Huddersfield and Birmingham manager will need to hit the ground running at Rugby Park, with the team just one point above the relegation play-off place. And his old team-mate Alex Rae - the St Mirren manager - reckons the Killie board have chosen wisely. \"I think he will be a very good addition to Scottish football,\" Rae told BBC Scotland. \"I knew him from playing against him, and he became a team-mate in 1997 when he joined Sunderland. \"Lee has been around a long, long time now as a player and in the coaching and management side of things.\" Kilmarnock can certainly expect to see a manager who wears his heart on his sleeve. \"The one thing about Lee Clark is you definitely see his passion, you see him running up and down the touchline,\" added Rae. \"The board will be looking for a little bit of a bounce, they will be hoping they can continue the form from the last couple of games where they have drawn with Rangers and got a really good result at the weekend [a 2-0 victory at Motherwell].\" \"He will be going into a dressing room that will be a wee bit encouraged.\" The undoubted highlight of Clark's managerial story thus far was his first job. It ran from 2008 to 2012 following coaching spells at Newcastle United and Norwich City. For a while he was a huge prospect down south, famously taking League One Huddersfield on a 43-match unbeaten run. Backed by chairman Dean Hoyle, the remit for Clark was to take The Terriers into the Championship. Twice they made the play-offs. Twice they failed to go up. Eventually patience ran out and in February 2012 Clark was sacked following a 1-0 defeat to Sheffield United - a decision that looked harsh considering Clark had only lost three of his previous 55 league matches to that point. Hoyle wanted promotion and got it, with Clark's replacement, Simon Grayson, delivering via the play-offs. One of Clark's last signings for Huddersfield was Kallum Higginbotham - a player he will be reunited with at Kilmarnock. Clark would graduate to the Championship with Birmingham City but it was a time of turmoil at the club. Twice he preserved their status in the division, albeit survival in the 2013-14 season was secured by the tightest of margins - an injury-time goal from former Celtic player Paul Caddis keeping them up on goal difference. But a poor start to the following season saw Clark sacked in October 2014. His last managerial stint was an unhappy one as he immediately moved to Blackpool, who were bottom of the Championship. Relegation followed and he resigned in May 2015. Rae thinks it would be wrong to read too much into this dismal spell at the Seasiders. \"The one thing about working for Blackpool - I was there as well - it is a really tough, tough environment to work in,\" he said. \"The downsizing in terms of the playing budget almost made it impossible to succeed there. I would not judge Lee on that last tenure.\" The Killie board clearly like what they see in Clark but he is entering an environment he has little experience of. The 43-year-old is joining a club where money is tight and this will present challenges. He will need to be resourceful to make changes. There is precious little breathing space at the foot of the Premiership and the stakes are high for a club that could certainly do without enduring the financial hardship relegation would bring. 'Big prospect' is a tag that has hung around Clark both as player and boss. That is no longer the case and there is a sense of unrealised potential. But there is clearly a hunger to succeed as well. Kilmarnock may not be a final throw of the dice for Clark but there are only so many chances for managers in a highly competitive marketplace. As a youngster Clark was an exciting talent with the club he loved, Newcastle United. He represented England at schoolboy and at under-21 level. He enjoyed a very successful career - twice finishing as a Premier League runner-up with the Magpies and also played in the top flight with Fulham. Lee McCulloch and Peter Leven are staying on as Killie coaches and Rae thinks Clark will rely heavily on his new Scottish lieutenants. \"These boys know the personnel and also the division,\" explained Rae. \"The one thing about Lee is he is a motivator.

The American regains the number one ranking from German Angelique Kerber. Australia's Margaret Court, with 24, is the only player still ahead of Serena in terms of Grand Slam singles titles. \"Congratulations Serena on number 23,\" said Venus, who at 36 is the oldest Australian Open finalist in the Open era. \"I have been right there with you, some of them I lost right there against you. It's been an awesome win. \"I'm enormously proud of you, you mean the world to me. I, God willing, would love to come back. Thank you for all the love.\" Serena paid tribute to her sister, who was playing her first major final for eight years, saying: \"There's no way I would be at 23 without her. There's no way I'd be at one without her. She's my inspiration. \"She's the only reason I'm standing here today. She's the only reason the Williams sisters exist. Thank you for inspiring me. Every time you won this week, I felt like I got a win too.\" Serena went into the match as a strong favourite, but the tension was apparent as early as the third game when she smashed a racquet in frustration, receiving a code violation. She had broken serve in the first and third games only to hand the advantage straight back each time, three double faults inexplicably littering a desperate game for 2-2. It was clear the six-time champion was struggling to settle, with 13 unforced errors in the opening five games, while elder sister Venus kept her under pressure with some deep hitting. The decisive move of the set came with a superb drop volley followed by a thumping forehand winner from Serena to break for 4-3, and this time she managed to consolidate on serve. In contrast to the opening stages, the following nine games went with serve - Venus recovering superbly from 0-40 early in the second set - but it was Serena who was creating the chances. She finally capitalised on her sixth break point of the set with a brilliant return to lead 4-3 and followed it up with her best service game of the match for 5-3. The crowd on Rod Laver Arena had been backing Venus from the beginning as she tried to win a first major title for eight years, and all the more so as defeat loomed and she appeared to struggle physically. There was a huge cheer when she held serve to force her sister to serve out the match, but Serena recovered from 15-30 to earn match point and fell back on the court in celebration as her sister sent the ball floating wide. Saturday's final was the 28th instalment of the sisters' on-court rivarly, which began at the Australian Open back in 1998, with Serena now 17-11 ahead and 7-2 up in Grand Slam finals. Venus, who turned professional in 1994 and has won five Wimbledon and two US Open titles, insisted she was not too disappointed after reaching her first major final since 2009. \"No, because I guess I've been here before, \"she said. \"I really enjoy seeing the name'Williams' on the trophy. This is a beautiful thing.\" Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent: Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Serena Williams is the length of time she has been winning Grand Slam titles. The first came on 11 September 1999 in New York; the 23rd on 28 January 2017 here in Melbourne. The match itself will quickly be forgotten; but never the achievement. Richard Williams used to beg tennis clubs to part with their old balls when he started to put his daughters through their paces in the Los Angeles district of Compton, and now Serena has more Grand Slam singles titles than anyone who has ever played the game, with the exception of Margaret Court. Williams is now just one behind the Australian - who was watching on the Rod Laver Arena - and in the view of the 18-time Grand Slam champion Martina Navratilova, it is a record she could \"shatter\" before her playing days are done.

But politics is about expectations. At one point a rumour swept the gathering that he'd lost more than a third of his alliance's seats in the Knesset - in the end the exit polls suggested it would be more like a quarter. Cue wild celebration. If you add together Mr Netanyahu's natural allies among the religious parties and the rest of the right - and assume he'll be able to attract at least one party from the centre or even the left - then he should be able to form a government again.

He emerges from these elections a rather diminished figure, whose wheeling and dealing skills may be sorely tested as he sets about building a new coalition. When he spoke to a crowd of activists in Tel Aviv he was measured, although it took him some time to persuade his supporters to stop celebrating long enough to make himself heard. \"I am going to seek as broad a government as possible,\" he said. \" I'm going to seek out many partners.\" That was perhaps his way of acknowledging that the overall results of the night were curiously ambiguous. To the left of Mr Netanyahu, Labour picked up seats but to the right of him so did Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home party) led by his former chief of staff Naftali Bennett. The undoubted star of the evening was Yair Lapid, a famous TV presenter who stepped off the screen to found a new centrist party called Yesh Atid (There is a Future). It has been an extraordinary debut. The party may well emerge as the second largest grouping in the new Knesset and should command a place in a Netanyahu-led coalition. Because Mr Lapid is a political newcomer, it's hard to say what price he might try to extract in return for his support. But you can expect a higher profile for the vexed issue of whether Israel's ultra-Orthodox community ought to be required to perform its share of national service (it's currently exempt). The wider world will examine these results for clues about Israel's future attitude towards peace talks with the Palestinians or the possibility of a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. The truth of the matter is that it's far too early to make those kind of judgements, which will depend on the balance of forces within a future coalition more than on the outcome of the popular vote. But the sudden and decisive lurch to the right that many predicted hasn't happened. The results show that there's plenty of life on the left and the centre of Israeli politics too. Some political journalists at Likud headquarters were arguing within hours of the exit polls that the results sent such a confused signal about the political mood in Israel that they made another election likely within a year. We'll see. Having said this is a chastening result for Benjamin Netanyahu it's only fair to record that it's been a thought provoking one for anyone in the business of making political predictions here, too. Mr Netanyahu was supposed to win easily - and he certainly didn't. And the campaign was supposed to have failed to capture the Israeli imagination - and turnout was remarkably high.

{"original_text": "Prof Allyson Pollock and colleagues at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous. They do not want an outright ban but say the sport must change and safeguards are needed. The Rugby Football Union said steps had been taken to make the sport safer. The RFU says the physical and social benefits that rugby offers to children \"massively outweigh any potential drawbacks\" and that myriad safety measures are already in place. These include the provision of a safe environment through investment in pitches and facilities, ensuring adequate first aid and medical facilities, and fully training coaches in methods to prevent injuries to young players. Ministers also want to see more children taking up sport. In 2012, then Culture Minister Jeremy Hunt announced a plan to link up thousands of schools with rugby clubs. But Prof Pollock fears there are not enough safety checks and measures to support this, meaning children could get hurt. She wants to see an increase in the recording of injuries and better injury prevention analysis. She claims that, compared with New Zealand, the UK has few strategies to protect players. Each season, children have about a one in 10 chance of getting injured badly enough that they need at least seven days off the pitch. Some injuries are minor, but others can cause permanent disability. Most rugby injuries occur during the tackle, as players collide at speed. But scrums are the most dangerous part of play, where some of the most serious injuries occur, Prof Pollock and colleagues say in their report in the British Medical Journal. Concussion and spinal trauma are the big concerns. Some injuries can prove fatal - as the Robinson family from County Antrim know only too well after their 14-year-old son, Ben, died having been hurt in a school rugby match in 2011. He collapsed at the end of that match after he was involved in a series of heavy tackles. An inquest heard that the teenager died from brain injuries. Prof Pollock says not enough is being done to put in place injury monitoring and prevention strategies - and little is known about what really works. \"Only by collecting injury data and by providing feedback to individuals and organisations working on safety initiatives will the short - and long-term impact of injury prevention programmes, whether for rugby or any other sport, be known,\" she said. She added some measures - such as matching child rugby players by size rather than age, playing only non-contact matches and having fewer players on the pitch at any one time - may help reduce the frequency of the most severe injuries. The RFU says set-phase play such as scrums and line-outs are introduced gradually, according to a child's rugby development, with scrums initially only containing three players per side and are uncontested. An RFU spokesman said: \"We take player safety extremely seriously, and this is at the core of all the training we deliver to coaches, referees and medics, at all levels of the game. \"Rugby for young people at schools or clubs in England exists in different forms, both contact and non-contact. \"Significant work has been undertaken over a number of years to develop new rules of play to ensure maximum possible safety, with a structured progression to cover the introduction, playing, teaching and refereeing of the game from under-seven to under-18.\" A government spokesman said: \"Player safety in schools and at all levels of sport is absolutely paramount and sports governing bodies and the government are completely committed to it. \"The rugby governing bodies work hard to ensure the sport in schools is played as safely as possible and that young people reap the benefits of participating - boosting their health, self-esteem and encouraging teamwork.\"", "text_perturb": "Prof Allyson Pollock and colleague at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous.

The licensing authority, Teignbridge Council, said it was investigating. The kennel said it was staffed by \"animal lovers who work tirelessly to care and rehabilitate the dogs.\" The RSPCA announced on Friday it had agreed with the Devon and Cornwall Police force's request to review the way in which dogs seized under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 were cared for in kennels. Whistleblowers have made a series of allegations about dogs being put in 3ft by 9ft cages and then, due to safety concerns, not exercised. These include Stella, who had been caged for nearly two years, and Vinnie, a Rottweiler who whistleblowers said had also not been exercised. The BBC has also been told that three puppies, brought in at 11-weeks old, were briefly walked before being denied exercise. Further claims have been made that stray dogs brought in by local councils were also denied exercise. Devon and Cornwall Police are understood to have used the kennels to place a number of seized dogs but said since 2012 they had only instructed staff not to exercise four of these. However, current and former members of staff have said as many as 20 dogs had'Do Not Enter' signs on their cages. Former kennel manager David Clark said in the three years he worked there he did not see those dogs exercised. A spokesman for the kennels said: \"The puppies were walked regularly, as part of their kennel enrichment activities. However, we carry out regular risk assessments, and for these particular dogs, as they came into maturity they started to show signs of aggression. \"We did have to stop the walks during the final few weeks of their stay with us. \"One member of staff was bitten and, of course, we do have to take into account the breed characteristics of their parents, both very dangerous dogs.\" The spokesman said the kennels had cared for many dogs over the years, and had \"an excellent working relationship with Devon and Cornwall Police.\" The spokesman said: \"We are animal lovers and work tirelessly to care and rehabilitate the dogs that come to us from the police, but unfortunately sometimes the risks are too great. \"We would of course welcome and fully support any investigation by the council or RSPCA.

{"original_text": "All examples of this group, known as the Archosauromorpha, lay eggs. This led some scientists to wonder whether there was something in their biology that prevented live births. But examination of the fossil remains of a very long-necked, 245 million-year-old marine reptile from China revealed it was carrying an embryo. Jun Liu, first author of the new study in Nature Communications, told BBC News that the animal would have measured between three and four metres long, with a neck that was about 1.7m long. The embryo may have been around half a metre long and is positioned inside the rib cage of the adult Dinocephalosaurus fossil, which was discovered in 2008 in Luoping County, Yunnan Province in southern China. Researchers had to consider whether the smaller animal might have been part of the adult's last meal. But it's facing forward, whereas swallowed prey generally face backwards because predators consume the animal head first to help it go down the throat. Another line of evidence in favour of the live birth idea is that the small reptile inside the mother is clearly an example of the same species. Co-author Prof Mike Benton, from the University of Bristol, told BBC News that the fossil was important because the Archosauromorpha form one of three large groupings of land-based vertebrates (backboned animals), each including about 10,000 species. Since we now know that no fundamental biological barrier to live births exists in this group, palaeontologists would be \"looking very closely\" at other fossils. He suggested one target would be a group of aquatic crocodile relatives - whose mode of reproduction was not well known. Prof Liu, from Hefei University of Technology in China, said the discovery pushes back evidence of reproductive biology in the archosauromorphs by 50 million years. The mode of reproduction in Dinocephalosaurus also points to how the sex of its offspring was determined. Co-author Prof Chris Organ, from Montana State University, added: \"Some reptiles today, such as crocodiles, determine the sex of their offspring by the temperature inside the nest. \"We identified that Dinocephalosaurus, a distant ancestor of crocodiles, determined the sex of its babies genetically, like mammals and birds.\" Prof Benton explained: \"This combination of live birth and genotypic sex determination seems to have been necessary for animals such as Dinocephalosaurus to become aquatic. \"It's great to see such an important step forward in our understanding of the evolution of a major group coming from a chance fossil find in a Chinese field.\" The possibility that an eggshell once surrounded the embryo but was not preserved in fossilisation could not be ruled out, said Prof Benton. But living Archosauromorphs all lay eggs very early in embryonic development, whereas this embryo is very advanced, with well developed bones. Furthermore, the team says Dinocephalosaurus's long neck and other features of its anatomy suggest it could not have manoeuvred easily out of the water, meaning a reproductive strategy like that of turtles - which lay eggs on land before returning to the water - was probably not an option.

The mignonette was my fave condiment for the oysters while the yummy dijonnaise was best for the mussels. The mussels were so good, we ordered another dozen! Cauliflower Soup - topped with fried capers; very rich and creamy and cauliflowery. The capers did much to provide an additional dimension to the otherwise 1D soup. Beet Salad - Red beets topped with some fruit, half crispy with small seeds (like a kiwi). Refreshing! Duck Confit - Served atop halved roasted brussel sprouts. The duck was pure and game-y, as duck confit should be as it's cooked in its own fat. I encouraged my hubby to pick up the bone and gnaw off the crispy parts. Magnificent. Croque Monsieur - served with shoestring fries; appropriately rich with the sauce and sunnyside egg on top but not overly salty like other versions I've had. Gnocchi a la Parisienne - I decided on this dish thinking it would be lighter and make up for all the food we had beforehand. Boy, was I wrong. First off, these aren't potato dumplings. They are pan-fried herbed flour dumplings sauteed with fennel, eggplant and other stuff. I thought it was delicious but the oil at the bottom of the dish indicated it wasn't the light fare I expected. At this point, the 5-6hr drive to Vegas overtook us so we bypassed dessert and requested our check. We realized maybe a long dinner wasn't ideal after we've been on the road for so long!

Cauliflower Soup - topped with fried capers ; very rich and creamy and cauliflowery. The capers cause much to provide an additional dimension to the otherwise 1D soup. Beet Salad - Red beets topped with some yield , half crispy with small seeds ( like a kiwi ). freshen ! Duck Confit - Served atop halved roasted brussel sprouts. The ducks egg was pure and game-y , as ducks egg confit should be as it 's cooked in its own fat. I encouraged my hubby to blame up the bone and gnaw off the crispy parts. Magnificent. Croque Monsieur - served with shoestring fries ; appropriately rich with the sauce and sunnyside orchis on top but not overly salty like other versions I 've had. Gnocchi a la Parisienne - I decided on this dish thought it would be lighter and make up for all the food we had beforehand. son , was I wrong. First off , these are n't potato dumplings. They are pan-fried herbed flour dumplings sauteed with florence fennel , eggplant and other stuff. I thought it was scrumptious but the oil at the bottom of the dish indicated it was n't the light fare I expected.

Instead, we focused our attention and appetite on the pork, chicken, and seafood offerings. And boy, we were not disappointed with the food! Some of our treats included shrimp shumai, chicken and shrimp crispy spring rolls, pork spare ribs with black bean sauce (basically just a serving of pork fat with some bone in it, but incredibly tasty), taro cakes, sharkfin dumplings, and several others. The servers were attentive, wheeling their cars around to every occupied table in the establishment. Well, all the servers except for one. I couldn't help but notice that one server seemed to avoid our table. At first, I thought it was my imagination. But then my wife noticed.

{"original_text": "Suppose there's an infinitely large piece of paper. You've drawn something on it. Every day, you add a little to the drawing, making it bigger or more detailed (or both). As time progresses, you start using more and more paper. Is the currently unused paper part of the drawing? No. That's just empty space. It contains nothing related to a drawing, because it needs to be a blank paper so you can then draw on it. Can we see the blank paper? No. Why not? We are part of the drawing. Second idea, as suggested by a friend Suppose you're looking at a picture on your 21\" monitor. But people tell you you're not looking at the whole picture. So you click the 'zoom out' button, and get to see the bigger picture (figuratively). Did your 21\" monitor become bigger? No. But the content of the monitor became more detailed. Maybe the universe isn't expanding, but only becoming more detailed, within the same boundaries. For someone observing from within (like us), we would assume the universe gets bigger because more stuff (details) is added.','This question has been asked quite a bit, and there's plenty of info on youtube, etc...but the simplest explanation is that the expansion of space has nothing to do with needing something to expand \"into.\" The idea is that space is getting bigger...just by getting bigger. It is getting bigger everywhere at once, in every direction. You couldn't make a 2-dimensional piece of paper larger in size without needing to make the edges larger in perimeter, but the universe is not like a piece of paper. If there's no such thing as an \"edge\" or \"boundary\" of the universe, then there is no need for that perimeter to enlarge, in order to make more \"room\" for the expanding space. EDIT: [This video] (URL0) explains how the expansion causes galaxies to appear to rush apart, rather than everything (including us) expanding in such a way that we couldn't notice it was happening. SECOND EDIT: [This video] has an even better explanation of some of these concepts. Props to uLoveGoblin for finding it.', \"There's two ways I like thinking about it. One to gain intuition, the other probably more reasonable. Imagine you and I are standing on the surface of a balloon (incidentally, this is one theoretical geometry of the universe, an example of a finite universe without a boundary), and someone is blowing it up. Although we are'standing still', the distance between us increases as the rubber stretches. This is a bit misleading though, because when the balloon grows size, it's growing in a 3 dimensional sense. We don't really know if the universe has an edge, and if it does,'what' lies beyond it. But expansion of the universe is a meaningful concept regardless, and you can think of it as someone turning a knob over time, a knob that controls the distance between objects in space. You probably know the standard distance formula in normal Euclidean geometry, given by ds2 dx2 dy2 dz2. This gives the distance between points in space. Well, in general relativity, one possible geometry (the spatial part) looks like ds2 a (t) (dx2 dy2 dz2).

It contains nothing related to a drawing , because it needs to be a blank newspaper publisher so you can then draw on it. give the sack we see the blank paper ? No. Why not ?

No. But the content of the reminder became more detailed. Maybe the universe is n't expanding , but only becoming more elaborate , within the same boundaries. For someone observing from within ( like us ) , we would assume the universe gets bigger because more than stuff ( details ) is added. ' , 'This head has been asked quite a bit , and there 's plenty of info on youtube , etc. . . but the simplest explanation is that the expansion of space has zippo to do with needing something to expand `` into. `` The musical theme is that space is getting bigger. . . just by bewilder bigger. It is getting bigger everywhere at once , in every focussing. You could n't make a 2-dimensional piece of paper larger in size without needing to make the edges larger in perimeter , but the universe is non like a piece of paper. If there 's no such thing as an `` edge '' or `` boundary '' of the universe , then there is no need for that perimeter to enlarge , in order to make more `` way '' for the expanding space. EDIT : [ This video ] ( URL0 ) explains how the expansion causes galaxies to appear to rush apart , rather than everything ( including us ) flesh out in such a way that we could n't notice it was happening. SECOND EDIT : [ This television ] has an even better explanation of some of these concepts. Props to uLoveGoblin for finding it. ' , `` There 's two style I like thinking about it. One to gain intuition , the other in all probability more reasonable. Imagine you and I are standing on the surface of a balloon ( incidentally , this is one theoretical geometry of the universe , an example of a finite universe without a boundary ) , and soul is blowing it up. Although we are'standing still ' , the distance between us increases as the caoutchouc stretches. This is a act misleading though , because when the balloon grows size , it 's growing in a 3 dimensional sense. We do n't real know if the universe has an edge , and if it does , 'what ' lies beyond it. But expansion of the universe is a meaningful concept regardless , and you can think of it as someone turning a knob over clip , a knob that controls the distance between objects in space. You probably know the standard distance formula in normal Euclidean geometry , pay by ds2 dx2 dy2 dz2. This make the distance between points in space. Well , in ecumenical relativity , one possible geometry ( the spatial part ) looks like ds2 a ( t ) ( dx2 dy2 dz2 ). In other words , whenever you compute distances between people , extragalactic nebula , etc. , you take the distance as you 're normally used to , but then you multiply what you get by a scaling factor , a ( t ) , which changes with time ( if it increase , then the universe is expanding ).

Sluggish economy , etc. Or just unsound management. Do n't worry , those bad managing director will always get their pay raise or severance package. Your landlord needs to yield his own bills.

This mean it 's a landlord 's market , and they can afford to charge higher rents. On the other hand , there are many areas of the country where buying property is extremely punk. , '' `` One affair that affects rents is property taxes. These taxes are typically a percentage of the economic value of the property. When they raise these taxes , which they seem to make out darn near every year , they are increasing the percentage of your property 's value the owner has to pay. And like you , I can not figure out how they can just proceed jacking this. Are we going to eventually pay 100 the value of our holding in taxes ? Seems ridiculous. , '' `` My house payment is less than 700 , but if I were to rent a similar house in my neighbourhood , the rent would be over 1000.

Generally, the amount of storage in any power grid is going to be very small and fluctuations of power demand are managed mostly by changing the amount of electricty being produced or through special agreements with large electricity users which allow grid managers to cut their supplies on short notice. Some places do have grid-scale energy storage in the form of pumping water from one reservoir to another, higher reservoir and then releasing it through hydro-electric turbines back the other way. There are also early installations which use compressed air in underground caverns to store electricity. The use of chemical capacitors (like batteries) is extremely limited in managing electrical load.', \"Power plants don't but on the town level they have things called substations that have capacitor banks that deal with the high frequency spikes.

It avoids any improper infection, making cause of death easier to rule. Also, having sterilized needles prevents staff members from getting any infection due to cross-contamination. It does seem counter-intuitive, yes.

During all the time it takes to get ready, the Governor can call and pardon the prisoner and tell everyone not to kill him. So they take out the needle, which must be clean to prevent infection. Legally, if the prisoner was to get sick because of the needle, his lawyers could argue that the prison broke the rules of how to keep prisoners (ELI20: The 6th Amendment on Cruel and Unusual Punishment) and try to get the prisoner life in prison instead, or even freed.

I don't think there's much of a market for non-sterile needles. They likely come from the same kind of suppliers as the ones health care providers and the general population get their supplies from. I'd be surprised if there was some kind of \"special\" equipment for lethal injection.

This includes swabbing the IV area with alcohol and iodine as well as using sterile , one-time-use phonograph needle. Regardless of setting , using sterilized needles makes affair safer for everyone involved. It avoids any improper contagion , making cause of death easier to rule. Also , having sterilized needles prevents staff extremity from getting any infection due to cross-contamination. It does seem counter-intuitive , yes. But since the main reason is to keep the condemned healthy until death is administered , spending the extra clock time to sanitize and sterilize is well worth it. `` find oneself this.

During all the time it takes to get ready , the Governor can call and pardon the captive and tell everyone not to kill him. So they take out the needle , which must cost clean to prevent infection. Legally , if the prisoner was to get sick because of the needle , his lawyers could argue that the prison broke the rules of how to keep prisoners ( ELI20 : The 6th Amendment on Cruel and Unusual Punishment ) and try to get the prisoner life in prison instead , or yet freed. So they 're really trying to cover their own ass at for possible options , as governments commonly try to do. , '' `` fun fact : doctors ca n't perform a lethal injection because of the Hippocratic Oath so the prisons hire interns and nurses to do it instead and you end up with write up , like this one , where they [ ca n't find the vein ] ( URL0 ) , You want them to keep a used , dirty needle around somewhere instead of just buying a box of clean ones for 10 and using a fresh one everytime ?

Higher temperatures end up having lower maximum voltages [This graph] (URL1) pretty much explains what happens with temperature. Higher temperatures mean higher current and lower maximum voltage.

I don't know but the blind woman seem very happy with her life now and that things are the way they were meant to be for her. Sorry I did not have an explanation for you and may have caused more confusion but I too think it is a fascinating question.,I think it varies on a case-by-case basis. Some people are born with one gender's sexual organs but produce a lot of the other set of sex hormones, so there is a biological explanation for feeling \"off.\" In other cases, it probably is just caused by brain abnormalities or feeling like their life isn't going so great and deciding that switching genders will somehow fix all of their problems.','I'm genuinely curious about the \"different brain\" theory. Does anyone have any links to scientific literature about what exactly is different about the brains of transgender people?', This type of question gets posted all the time.] (URL1) And every time it's filled with a bunch of shit answers.,Gender, as a whole, is made up of many complex elements including differences in the brain (eg hypothalamus size), hormones and chemicals, chromosomal abnormalities, and social upbringing. All of these factors together create gender, and if one or more of these doesn't align with the others, that can cause dysphoria. This is my own definition and how I've always thought of transgenderism. To me, it makes a lot of sense that these factors are delicate and the human body and mind are super tempermental, so it's not a stretch to think that people could experience dysphoria. That doesn't make them crazy, because they could literally have a chemical or brain imbalance that causes this. Conversely, I think of \"trans-racial\" as being impossible because there aren't similar factors. There's no way a white person would be born with a \"black\" brain, or chromosomes. To me, when people want to be another race, it generally is because they feel that they fit into the stereotype of that race. But just because you like rap and talk in AAVE doesn't make you black, in fact many black people don't do those things! You can't base your identity on stereotypes. Conversely, a black person trying to be white (I mean literally- not \"oh they dress well they want to be white which is racist) is probably doing so as the result of conditioning by society which shows them that white people are far more successful and respectable. tl;dr Being transgender is actually chemically possible, not just a mental state. Being trans-racial is not physiologically possible and is based in stereotypes.','Seems like people are arguing over word definitions because they have different ideas of the terms. Im no historian but I believe the word \"gender\" used to refer to the \"sex\" (what reproductive organ you were born with) of the individual. Now the word \"gender\" has turned into the role you play in society. Why? Because people caused it to become that way. IMO the people who care about being called something they don't agree with. And this could be something that is true yet they personally have a problem with it. For example, if a women (person born with a vagina) wants to prove her masculinity, prove that she is just as good or better than any man, then she would take offense to being called a women because in her mind she when hears woman, she thinks of something opposite of her. Like Pink dresses, stay at home moms, make up, etc.','Mostly because we have a wealth of brain scans from transgender individuals backing up that there is more to it than just dysphoria.', \"Please everybody, post sources.

Really? I think, rather, that APA states it needs to cause psychological stress or anxiety to be diagnosed as a disorder.

The students have a new fee ( not counted as a taxation increase by Grover 's pledge ) but it 's offset with the taxation credit ( which the Grover people can count as a revenue reduction ). indeed Jindal is counting this tax credit as offsetting his tobacco etc. tax growth I mentioned before. So in realism it does n't literally offset the revenue because it 's offsetting student fees that do n't really exist.

Since color information occupies a large proportion of the total storage size of an image, a method that can predict accurate color from its grayscale version can produce a dramatic reduction in image file size. But colorization for compression poses several challenges. First, while colorization for artistic purposes simply involves predicting plausible chroma, colorization for compression requires generating output colors that are as close as possible to the ground truth. Second, many objects in the real world exhibit multiple possible colors. Thus, in order to disambiguate the colorization problem some additional information must be stored to reproduce the true colors with good accuracy. To account for the multimodal color distribution of objects we propose a deep tree-structured network that generates for every pixel multiple color hypotheses, as opposed to a single color produced by most prior colorization approaches. We show how to leverage the multimodal output of our model to reproduce with high fidelity the true colors of an image by storing very little additional information.

An essential aspect is that traits collectively evolve under the repeated action of social influence interactions, which is the focus of many quantitative studies of cultural dynamics. In this paradigm, dynamical models require that all traits are fixed when specifying the \"initial cultural state.\" Typically, this initial state is randomly generated, from a uniform distribution over the set of possible combinations of traits. However, recent work has shown that the outcome of social influence dynamics strongly depends on the nature of the initial state: if this is sampled from empirical data instead of being generated in a uniformly random way, a higher level of cultural diversity is found after long-term dynamics, for the same level of propensity towards collective behavior in the short-term; moreover, if the initial state is obtained by shuffling the empirical traits among people, the level of long-term cultural diversity is in-between those obtained for the empirical and random counterparts. The current study repeats the analysis for multiple empirical data sets, showing that the results are remarkably similar, although the matrix of correlations between cultural variables clearly differs across data sets. This points towards robust structural properties inherent in empirical cultural states, likely due to universal laws governing the dynamics of culture in the real world.

Recent studies have revealed that, for a single-layer network, synergy can enhance spreading and even induce an explosive contagion. There is at the present a growing interest in behavior spreading dynamics on multiplex networks. What is the role of synergistic interactions in behavior spreading in such networked systems? To address this question, we articulate a synergistic behavior spreading model on a double layer network, where the key manifestation of the synergistic interactions is that the adoption of one behavior by a node in one layer enhances its probability of adopting the behavior in the other layer. A general result is that synergistic interactions can greatly enhance the spreading of the behaviors in both layers. A remarkable phenomenon is that the interactions can alter the nature of the phase transition associated with behavior adoption or spreading dynamics. In particular, depending on the transmission rate of one behavior in a network layer, synergistic interactions can lead to a discontinuous (first-order) or a continuous (second-order) transition in the adoption scope of the other behavior with respect to its transmission rate. A surprising two-stage spreading process can arise: due to synergy, nodes having adopted one behavior in one layer adopt the other behavior in the other layer and then prompt the remaining nodes in this layer to quickly adopt the behavior.

{"original_text": "As light field images continue to increase in use and application, it becomes necessary to adapt existing image processing methods to this unique form of photography. In this paper we explore methods for applying neural style transfer to light field images. Feed-forward style transfer networks provide fast, high-quality results for monocular images, but no such networks exist for full light field images. Because of the size of these images, current light field data sets are small and are insufficient for training purely feed-forward style-transfer networks from scratch. Thus, it is necessary to adapt existing monocular style transfer networks in a way that allows for the stylization of each view of the light field while maintaining visual consistencies between views. To do this, we first generate disparity maps for each view given a single depth image for the light field. Then in a fashion similar to neural stylization of stereo images, we use disparity maps to enforce a consistency loss between views and to warp feature maps during the feed forward stylization. Unlike previous work, however, light fields have too many views to train a purely feed-forward network that can stylize the entire light field with angular consistency. Instead, the proposed method uses an iterative optimization for each view of a single light field image that backpropagates the consistency loss through the network.

However, the state-of-the-art data series indexes that are used for this purpose do not scale well for massive datasets in terms of performance, or storage costs. We pinpoint the problem to the fact that existing summarizations of data series used for indexing cannot be sorted while keeping similar data series close to each other in the sorted order. To address this problem, we present Coconut, the first data series index based on sortable summarizations, and the first efficient solution for indexing and querying streaming series. The first innovation in Coconut is an inverted, sortable data series summarization that organizes data series based on a z-order curve, keeping similar series close to each other in the sorted order. As a result, Coconut is able to use bulk-loading and updating techniques that rely on sorting to quickly build and maintain a contiguous index using large sequential disk IOs. We then explore prefix-based and median-based splitting policies for bottom-up bulk-loading, showing that median-based splitting outperforms the state of the art, ensuring that all nodes are densely populated. Finally, we explore the impact of sortable summarizations on variable size window queries, showing that they can be supported in the presence of updates through efficient merging of temporal partitions.

As far as we know , our work is the first to fuse a deep recurrent neural network and a fuzzy neural network to sit complex spatial-temporal feature interactions with additional uncertain input features for predictive learning. Experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset show that our model achieves more than 10 melioration over the state-of-the-art approaches. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "The long-standing byzantine agreement problem gets more attention in recent years due to the increasing demand for scalable geo-replicated Byzantine state machine replication (SMR) systems (e.g., Blockchains). To date, the key bottleneck of such systems is the communication cost of the byzantine agreement they employ as a building block, which motivates many researchers to search for low-communication byzantine agreement protocols. The conventional approach is to design deterministic protocols in the eventually synchronous communication model that are optimized to reduce the communication cost after the global stabilization time (GST). In this paper, we challenge the conventional approach and argue it is not the best fit for scalable SMR systems since it might induce an unbounded communication cost during asynchronous periods before GST, which we prove to be inherent. Instead, we forgo eventual synchrony and propose a different approach that hopes for the best (synchrony) but prepares for the worst (asynchrony). Accordingly, we design an optimistic protocol that first tries to reach an agreement via an efficient deterministic algorithm that relies on synchrony for termination, and then, only if an agreement was not reached due to asynchrony, the protocol uses a randomized asynchronous algorithm for fallback that guarantees termination with probability 1. Although randomized asynchronous algorithms are considered to be costly, we design our solution to pay this cost only when an equivalent cost has already been paid while unsuccessfully trying the synchronous protocol.

Multi-AP coordination is a promising technique towards IEEE 802.11be, and there are studies that use RL for multi-AP coordination. Indeed, a simple RL-based multi-AP coordination method diminishes the collision probability among the APs; therefore, the method is a promising approach to improve time-resource efficiency. However, this method is vulnerable to frame transmissions of uncoordinated APs that are less aware of frame transmissions of other coordinated APs. To help the central agent experience even such unexpected frame transmissions, in addition to the central agent, the proposed method also competitively trains an adversarial AP that disturbs coordinated APs by causing frame collisions intensively. Besides, we propose to exploit a history of frame losses of a coordinated AP to promote reasonable competition between the central agent and adversarial AP.

{"original_text": "We assume that recommender systems are more successful, when they are based on a thorough understanding of how people process information. In the current paper we test this assumption in the context of social tagging systems. Cognitive research on how people assign tags has shown that they draw on two interconnected levels of knowledge in their memory: on a conceptual level of semantic fields or topics, and on a lexical level that turns patterns on the semantic level into words. Another strand of tagging research reveals a strong impact of time dependent forgetting on users' tag choices, such that recently used tags have a higher probability being reused than \"older\" tags. In this paper, we align both strands by implementing a computational theory of human memory that integrates the two-level conception and the process of forgetting in form of a tag recommender and test it in three large-scale social tagging datasets (drawn from BibSonomy, CiteULike and Flickr). As expected, our results reveal a selective effect of time: forgetting is much more pronounced on the lexical level of tags. Second, an extensive evaluation based on this observation shows that a tag recommender interconnecting both levels and integrating time dependent forgetting on the lexical level results in high accuracy predictions and outperforms other well-established algorithms, such as Collaborative Filtering, Pairwise Interaction Tensor Factorization, FolkRank and two alternative time dependent approaches.

However, CT exposes radiation during acquisition, which may cause side effects to patients. Compared to CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is much safer and does not involve any radiations. Therefore, recently, researchers are greatly motivated to estimate CT image from its corresponding MR image of the same subject for the case of radiotherapy planning. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to address this challenging problem. Specifically, we train a fully convolutional network to generate CT given an MR image. To better model the nonlinear relationship from MRI to CT and to produce more realistic images, we propose to use the adversarial training strategy and an image gradient difference loss function.

Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God, Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ, imputed to Christians (rather than infused into them) through faith. \"That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law,\" he wrote. \"Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ.\" Faith, for Luther, was a gift from God; the experience of being justified by faith was \"as though I had been born again.\" His entry into Paradise, no less, was a discovery about \"the righteousness of God\" - a discovery that \"the just person\" of whom the Bible speaks (as in Romans 1:17) lives by faith.

He was baptized as a Catholic the next morning on the feast day of St. Martin of Tours. His family moved to Mansfeld in 1484, where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council. The religious scholar Martin Marty describes Luther's mother as a hard-working woman of \"trading-class stock and middling means\" and notes that Luther's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant. He had several brothers and sisters, and is known to have been close to one of them, Jacob. Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family, and he was determined to see Martin, his eldest son, become a lawyer.

{"original_text": "Both X.25 and Frame Relay provide connection-oriented operations. But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDsthe virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLCLAPDLAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS.

Because the problem P NP is not solved , being capable to reduce a known NP-complete problem , P2 , to another problem , P1 , would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for P1. This live because a polynomial-time solution to P1 would yield a polynomial-time solution to P2. likewise , because all NP problems can be reduced to the set , finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P NP.

{"original_text": "First, let me clarify by saying I don't support actual, intentional bashing of any kind, however: We see jokes about it (especially on Reddit) all the time: political correctness is reaching a ludicrous level in our everyday society. It is getting to the point where you can't even make jokes or off-hand remarks without being considered rude, distasteful, ignorant, what ever. I think this is not only not really helpful to a person or group of persons who are facing adversity, it is detrimental. It causes issues that could be making actual progress to falter and nit-pick all of the tiniest little problems they can find rather than strive for real change. It is inadvertently focussing on the negativity in society rather than trying to find a positive solution. It is my opinion that the only way to get past adversity in life is to toughen up and become immune to it and push your way through it. Real change comes about because of real actions. This post was inspired by the earlier discussion on the use of the word \"cisgendered\" and wether it is \"normal\" or wether we should then be differentiating the difference between diabetics and nondiabetics and so forth. I don't think this is a helpful debate overall. sure, if you are asking what gender someone is, it is okay, even good, to distinguish, but all I keep seeing around here, and in real life, and at an increasing rate, is how we all need to check our privilege and be more and more sympathetic; how white people can't relate to minority problems, men can't relate to women's suffrage, cisgendered people can't really understand what transgendered people go through... it just keeps getting more and more specific, and in my opinion, its just focussing everyone's attention on what is wrong with the world, and doesn't actually help us make it better. Adversity is everywhere, it hits everyone. I may be a man, but maybe my dad sexually abused me and locked me in the basement my whole childhood. That girl may be white, but maybe she was raised in a seedy part of town with a drug addicted prostitute mother. Maybe that guy is a straight white male from a nice neighborhood, but he was somehow infected with HIV and now he has AIDS. My point is, none of those people are going to get through their hardships by focussing on those things they can't change, doing so would only hinder their own growth. I can't help but think the same thing when I hear about someone getting upset about someone else using language they find to be offensive. Again, I'm not saying bullying is okay, but the line between what is considered okay to joke about, and what is borderline a hate crime seems to be getting thinner and thinner. In my eyes, trying to further political correctness is only babying everyone and hindering actual growth. TL;DR There is no relative degree of suffering, everyone has a hard life, and trying to force everyone to walk on eggshells all the time doesn't help anyone make their life better. I hope you don't think I'm terrible for thinking this way, and I would love to hear everyone's input. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I believe that the entire internet business model is backwards in that , in the regular world businesses change to create the way hoi polloi consume whereas with the internet it decides on how it wants it 's hoi polloi to consume. A prime example of this is the Xbox one and it 's `` always on '' kinect good example and how fan outrage actually forced a business good example change. Whereas adblock users are made to enjoy a minute long mute image saying `` this is where an ad would be if adblock was off , by the way the ad is 30 seconds '' After reading something like that , I 'm actually more deterred to disabling adblock on principal alone.

I was pretty annoyed to discover that [aspects of the film's plot were warped for the purpose of making it more dramatic] . I do not think any good comes of this, and to be honest it makes me quite mad. For example, in the film, the main character Alan Turing is portrayed by the actor as obviously autistic to some extent, but according to a quote on Wikipedia (not sure exactly who said it) \"the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film.... bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing.\" This, I think, is insulting to Turing's memory, to customise his personality as to make the film more interesting or to make the audience more sympathetic towards his character. Sometimes it's less minor than character modification. I distinctly remember watching 13 Days (2000) in a high school history class to supplement our Cold War study. This film ramped up the'Soviets are evil and JFK is a god' theme to the point of including an entirely fictional battle scene, but went out of its way to present itself as a historically accurate film, including real Cold War footage throughout.

It's also been criticised for attributing a major role in the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis to Kenneth O'Donnell - somebody who was actually there argues that \"For God's sakes, Kenny O'Donnell didn't have any role whatsoever.... that's absurd.\" I think overblowing or underplaying real people's roles in history is just insulting, and cannot be justified. Thus, I am suggesting that films which are'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred. I will pre-argue some anticipated arguments in advance: \"They're claiming to be based on a true story, not perfectly historically accurate.\" Yes, but these films spread misinformation all the same.

In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want to is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to things that are unacceptable to do to a person without his or her permission. Telling someone that they can't get a medical procedure done (or, likewise, telling that they HAVE to get a medical procedure done) is just as awful as is dictating how they were their hair or how they dress. In that same vein, what makes it okay in our society for your significant other to dictate who you sleep with? Sex in our society is a recreational activity enjoyed by most adults in at least some capacity. People dictating what their SOs do for fun in their free time seems rather controlling.

I understand that people cheat all the time, but open relationships just seem to be the exception rather than the norm. If you want a monogamous relationship and your SO sleeps with someone else, then you shouldn't be mad at your SO. You should simply realize that you guys want different things out of a relationship and part ways. Getting angry would be controlling your SO and taking away his or her own control over his or her own body. And just for clarification: I am not saying that everyone should go out and cheat on their SOs. I am more stating that it should be normal and acceptable for people to have sex with people outside of a two person relationship for no other reason than that it is oddly controlling to insist that your SO sleep with no one besides you. Also, I wanted to point out that I am purposefully not using particular genders.

You should simply realize that you guys want different things out of a relationship and part way. become angry would be controlling your SO and taking away his or her own control over his or her own body. And just for clarification : I am not saying that everyone should go out and cheat on their sos. I am more stating that it should be normal and satisfactory for people to have sex with people outside of a two person relationship for no other reason than that it is oddly controlling to insist that your SO sleep with no one besides you. Also , I wanted to point out that I am purposefully not using particular sexuality. It is just as bad to for a adult female to tell a man he ca n't have sex outside the relationship as it would be if a man told a adult female the same thing. so , please. Change my view ! Why should it be the norm to have monogamous relationships ? Hello , exploiter of CMV ! This is a footnote from your moderators. We 'd just like to cue you of a couple of things.

{"original_text": "Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich. However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons: First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were \"more equal than the others.\" Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people's inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. Second of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it. If for example say USA will start implementing even minor socialists norms, then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers of USA and take away their jobs. Which is indeed the case with things like outsourcing and not so quickly growing USA economy. The solution for USA would then be to close itself up and live in a world where there are no imports or exports, this would protect its citizens from fierce external competition, but leave USA lacking behind in progress of all kinds. Examples for this are Venezuela or Columbia. All in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc. However this are minor elements, which I think, should otherwise be implemented in fierce Capitalist society, where in order to succeed you cannot rely on gov. support, but 95 on yourself.

Such a tattoo would not affect chances of college acceptance for three reasons; the ubiquity of tattoos amongst college-aged individuals, the relative unimportance of personal image in the college acceptance process, and the low chance of anyone even seeing the tattoo. According to a Pew Research Centre report, nearly 38 of college-aged individuals have a tattoo. While that is not a majority by quite a margin, it is a significant amount. Additionally, the popularity and accessibility of tattoos are steadily increasing year by year leading to a greater acceptance amongst a younger crowd. The point here is that because of their widespread nature, tattoos are no longer seen as a sign of rebellion simply because they are so commonplace. Furthermore, most colleges prefer to accept or deny students based on their applications alone, rather than on interviews. Unlike a job interview, in which personal image can make or break someone's chances of getting employment, colleges tend to focus more on scholastic and athletic merit, test scores, and lifetime achievements first. Personal image is last on the docket for a school good enough to conduct personal interviews, if even considered at all. The previous two points also assume that a college will know about this tattoo, whereas that may not even be the case. In an interview process, there is no chance that the tattoo will be exposed in formal clothing. If the tattoo is exposed after acceptance, then there is no risk of a college retroactively denying admission based on that alone. This third point is also the keystone argument when it comes to employment. For the sake of this argument, I will assume that if an employer knows about any sort of tattoo, it will result in immediately being passed over for the job. This is not consistent with reality and the first two points I make concerning college can be applied to employment as well; tattoos are slowly gaining acceptance in the workforce as the 38 of college students with tattoos graduate and seek employment, and that employers will seek to hire the most qualified candidate with less emphasis placed on personal image. But even discarding these arguments, the possibility of an employer finding out about a tattoo covered by conservative formal clothing in professional situations is nil.

{"original_text": "I am strictly a PC gamer. I own an XBox controller for my PC and am very interested in the upcoming Steam controller. But I'm hesitant to make the purchase, as I barely use my XBox controller. I have tried several times to get used to playing with a controller - even reinstalling old games and starting with the controller to familiarize myself - and I always go back to'mouse and keyboard'. Below are the reasons I think'mouse and keyboard' is the best way to play PC games (really: any game, but KM is really only an option on the PC). The mouse is infinitely more precise than a controller. I can't even imagine playing FPS games with a controller (mostly, I've been playing 3rd-person action games a la Arkham and Tomb Raider). I know many FPS games use an aim assist system to compensate for the imprecision of a controller. I would rather have a more precise input system than an'assist' to compensate for the imprecision of my input device. Because we use them all the time, a keyboard is intuitive. Most of us use computer keyboards and mice on a daily basis in our work. Every QWERTY keyboard has the same layout. When a game tells me'press X', I know exactly where X is. Even people who are very familiar with controller layouts haven't spent nearly as much time with that controller as they have with a keyboard and mouse. Keyboard and mouse work for all games. As I mentioned, I prefer the precision of KM for FPS games. But I'm also a big-time RTS and strategy gamer (Total War are my favorite games) and there's no way I could imagine playing strategy games with a controller. KM works for everything. I even preferred Dark Souls with a KM - a game that many will say is only playable with a controller. I am perfectly comfortable in my computer chair. One of the big advantages I often hear about controllers is the ability to play from the couch. I prefer to be close to my display (I play on a 32in TV and sit about 3 feet back). My keyboard and mouse sit on a laptop desk and my computer chair is very comfortable. I feel more engaged in my games at the distance I sit vs. sitting on the couch. Why I want my view changed: I think the Steam controller looks really cool, but I'm not sure I'd use it. I don't want to make a purchase I won't use. Am I missing out on good experiences that only a controller can offer? I've got a device I barely use. I would like to use it more, if there are games in which using it would give me a better experience. Edit: many good suggestions in this thread so far. I'm going to spend a few minutes playing some of the types of games mentioned (stealth, action, driving, etc.) and see if the controller enhances the experience. Edit 2: Hey everyone. Thanks so much for the discussion. Lots of good points made, but I think the best was made by ustoopydumbut, who suggested that using a controller adds an additional level of challenge. Props, also, to all the users who pointed out the genres of games (racing, fighting, flight sims) that I don't play, but benefit from a controller. I am going to make it point to use my controller as often as I can going forward, and am still considering a Steam controller purchase. Thanks, everyone, this was exactly the conversation I wanted to have. Please feel free to keep posting, if you have something new to add. I will keep reading, commenting, and awarding deltas.

{"original_text": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is one of the most important resources for diagnosing mental disorders, and is utilised around the world by psychiatrists and psychologists alike.

In general, the other criteria include mostly unimpaired functioning, no obviously bizarre behaviour, no major manic or depressive episodes, no substance abuse, and no other identified mental disorder.

{"original_text": "Immediately after graduating college I was searching for my first \"real\" job, and thought that 12.50hr at that time (1999) was a lot of money. So I went to work for a rent-to-own company, and 5 years of pain and suffering began. There were a combination of factors that I believe make this accurate. First, the hours were long (55 per week), and where the 12.50hr got severely diluted. They would tell you the starting salary was, say 27k year, and then once you divided that out by 55 hours per week as opposed to a normal 40 hour week, you got a much lower hourly figure. These shenanigans led to the company facing some legal trouble at various points in its history, both pre and post me. Second, it was very physically demanding. I moved furniture all day, every day for 55 hours per week. We carried couches, big screen TV's, washer, dryers, etc - all into places they normally have no business going - basements, attics, 3rd floor apartments up rickety staircases, very dangerous. Third, and probably the worst part, was the interaction with customers. Our clientele were the down and out, the disadvantaged, criminals, strippers, drug dealers, etc. People with no credit, who couldn't buy their desired goods on credit. We rented them shit they couldn't afford, for the desired markup of 5x what we paid for the items.

First , the  minutes were long ( 55 per week ) , and where the 12. 50hr got severely adulterate. They would tell you the starting salary was , say 27k year , and then once you divided that out by 55 hours per week as opposed to a normal 40 hour week , you got a much lower hourly bod.

I moved furniture all solar day , every solar day for 55 hours per week. We carried couches , big silver screen TV 's , washer , dryers , etc - all into places they normally have no business going - basements , attics , 3rd floor apartments up rickety staircases , very dangerous. Third , and probably the worst part , cost the interaction with customers. Our clientele were the down and out , the disadvantaged , criminals , sprigger , drug dealers , etc. People with no credit , who could n't bribe their desired goods on credit.

{"original_text": "Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for \"sleeping around,\" and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour. I want to make this point clear - I am NOT debating whether or not it is goodbad when a woman engages in behavior that is typically defined under the scope of \"slut.\" That is another argument altogether. I am only asserting that the difference in reaction the majority of people have when they hear about the sexual exploits of either gender is, in general, justified. The reason for this, of course, is biological. It is generally imperative for males to propagate their DNA throughout many different potential mates as possible, to ensure the survival of his line. Historically, however, females had to be more restrictive with who they engage in intercourse with, because they were then strapped with the burden of taking care ofraising a child as a product of the encounter. The brains, hormone profiles, and physiology are disparate between the genders to reflect, in part, these differences in motivation. Given these differences, the crux of my argument boils down to this: it is simply more difficult for a heterosexual man to attain sex, than a woman, ceterus paribus. Once again, to be very clear, I'm not making any moral claims about being a slut; I'm simply stating the difference in difficulty in accomplishing the same task, and the justification of the subsequent reaction. To illustrate this point, I would like to I highlight the scenario of Bob. Bob built a business from the ground up; through sheer hard work and determination, he came from nothing, and now runs a company of hundreds of employees, making millions in revenue. Now, here is Patrick. Patrick also has a company of hundreds of employees, making million dollars in revenue, through his hard work and determination. The difference between Bob and Patrick is this - Bob had absolutely zero dollars in his bank account when he started his business, while Patrick inherited over 5 billion from his father's trust fund. So, even though both have technically accomplished the same thing, it would be fair to say that Bob deserves higher praise. The difference being, of course, while the task itself was the same, the difficulty level of either party to achieveaccomplish this task is significantly different. In the same way, we can assert that (all things being equal) it is much more difficult for a man to sleep with many women, than the reverse. Now, anticipating potential rebuttals, I would like to highlight other scenarios using the same logic above: I believe that heterosexual men (and homosexual women) deserve more praise than homosexual men for the same acts. To what degree, I'm honestly not sure, as I'm not an expert in biologysociology of this kind, but using the biological argument for the difficulty of the task, I would say that homosexual men hooking up is generally easier than the other scenarios. I could be wrong on this, but it's more of an ancillary point rather than my main argument. To make sure that you've been reading all the way down to the bottom, I would really appreciate it if you started your post with any word that rhymes with \"crime.\" Thanks!!! Hello, users of CMV!

For any given American male, I believe the chances are less (possibly way less) than 50 that he will at some point in his life have a sexual encounter that truly fulfills his fantasies. I think this is due to a combination of factors, that when taken together hurt his chances greatly: 1) Most mainstream media (movies, TV, magazines, websites, porn, etc.) focuses on very attractive women (and men). Most people (maybe 80-90) don't get anywhere near those standards. Yet the media offers what becomes, in many cases, the yardstick by which we judge attractiveness. This means the pool of attractive potential partners becomes smaller both for the guy and for those he has an interest in. 2) Many if not most men watch porn, and a lot (though certainly not all) of it glorifies unrealistic or demeaning things done to (generally) attractive people who are paid to do it and to act like they enjoy it whether they really do or not. A ludicrous amount of free porn is available to most people, usually from a young age, and much easier to access than an actual partner. 3) Lots of food, sedentary lifestyles, increasing obesity.

{"original_text": "Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women in positions of power - increase the number of women that are firefighters or police I can't help feeling that it is a rather useless cause. I have no problem at all with there being less women than men in any place. What I would (and do) have a problem with is women having it more difficult than men to enter certain professions. That is the real problem we should, as a society, try to solve. The current approach is \"forcing\" the proportion of women to increase, by means of: - gender-specific student grants, - positions reserved for women, - lower physical requirements, - etc. As I see it this kind of solutions are problematic in two ways: - They involve so-called \"positive discrimination,\" which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman. This is absurd and can increase animosity in the male coworkers. Admittedly, that would be wrong on their part, but it still can create an hostile work environment. - They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. The only benefits I see is that \"artificially\" increasing the number of women in certain places may make the presence of women in said place appear less \"unusual\" to society, thereby decreasing the discrimination, but I still think they do more harm than good. Reddit, change my view! PD: English is not my first language, so I apologize for any awkwardly phrased sentence I may have written, and welcome any correction. EDIT: In only a few hours there have been a lot of great answers that have confirmed my feeling that this was a more nuanced issue that I could even imagine. My view has been changed in that I had underestimated the benefits of this kind of measures. In particular I now see that: - Artificially increasing the number of women in certain fields makes said fields much less \"threatening\" to other women. - Makes male coworkers appreciate the capabilities of women, decreasing further discrimination. - Improves the selection process by eliminating male-favoring biases. Whenever a man less prepared than a woman would have got the position by conscious or unconscious biases a well-prepared woman will get it. I remain unconvinced that physical tests should have easier versions for women. Most people seemed to agree with me on this, though.

The result is that everyone is able to survive happilyhealthily and with equal resources from sharing. Right-wing views seem to pretty much say that everyone is in it for themself. Everyone should be'allowed' to get rich by exploiting others, because everyone has the same opportunities to do that. People that are successful in exploiting othersgetting richetc are just those who have worked the hardest. It then follows that people who are unable to do those things - for example, because they are ill or disabled - should not be helped. Instead, they should \"just try harder\" or \"just get better,\" or at worst \"just die and remove themselves from the gene pool.\" When right-wing people are worried about left-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be allowed to make as much money, or that their money will be taken away. They're basically worried that they won't be able to be better off than everyone else. When left-wing people are worried about right-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be able to survive without others helping and sharing. They are basically worried for their lives. It seems pretty obvious to conclude that right-wing politics are more selfish and dangerous than left-wing politics, based on what people are worried about. How can right-wing politics be reconciled with supporting and caring for ill and disabled people? How do right-wing people justify their politics when they literally cause some people to fear for their lives? Are right-wing politics inherently selfish? Please, change my view! Edit: I want to clarify a bit here. I'm not saying that right-wing people or politicians are necessarily selfish. Arguing that all politicians are selfish in the same way does not change my view (I already agree with that). I'm talking more about right- or left-wing ideas and their theoretical logical conclusions. Imagine a'pure' (though not necessarily authoritarian) right-wing person who was able to perfectly construct the society they thought was ideal - that's the kind of thing I want to understand. Edit 2: There are now officially too many comments for me to read all of them. I'll still read anything that's a top-level reply or a reply to a comment I made, but I'm no longer able to keep track of all the other threads! If you want to make sure I notice something you write that's not a direct reply, tag me in it. Edit 3: I've sort of lost track of the particular posts that helped because I've been trying to read everything. But here is a summary of what I have learnedwhat views have changed: Moral views are distinct from political views - a person's opinion about the role of the government is nothing to do with their opinion about whether people should be cared for or be equal. Most people are basically selfish anyway, but most people also want to do what is right for everyone in their own opinion. Right-wing people (largely) do not actually think that people who can't care for themselves shouldn't be helped. They just believe that private organisations (rather than the government) should be responsible for providing that help. They may be of the opinion that private organisations are more efficient, cheaper, fairer, or better at it than the government in various ways. Right-wing people believe that individuals should have the choice to use their money to help others (by giving to charitable organisations), rather than be forced into it by the government. They would prefer to voluntarily donate lots of money to charity, than to have money taken in the form of taxes which is then used for the same purposes. Hello, users of CMV!

{"original_text": "First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that even many of the violent criminals who are jailed don't need to be locked up for as long to prevent them from being an immediate or persistent threat. In fact, I believe that long term incarceration under harsh conditions is something which actually causes further social harm - directly to the person incarcerated and to the society which the prisoner will be released into after an extended period of incarceration. Also, if the person has dependents, they too might suffer more if their material needs are not adequately provided for. Subsequently, if some sort of punishment is required for violating some sort of socially accepted institution, then I feel that some form of shaming, shunning, and exile are possibly effective alternatives to prevent crime before we decide to incarcerate someone for an extended period of time or issue fines which they may not be able to pay. One advantage to this approach is that the punishment is more directly democratic.

It need not be inherently incriminating; it might be whether you were at a particular meeting, or whether you talked to someone about the existence of the investigation.

{"original_text": "I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing by buying the product for 1 cent cheaper. It doesn't really add up for that much, and it is outweighed for how much extra the consumer spends due to being misled. Stores wouldn't do it otherwise. I would find it hard to believe that the prices are caused by competition and market equilibrium (i.e. that it would be rationally cheaper to buy at the 599.99 store than the 600 store). It would be a huge coincidence if it turned out that the \"real market price\" just happened to stop at that arbitrary.99 point. Furthermore, it appears that monopolies such as airport snack shops are doing it as well, and they have no competition. Therefore, I argue that it has no benefit to the consumer and it is done in bad faith. Of course, the consumer ought to be responsible when buying, but a practice like this very intentionally exploits such moments of minor inattention. This gives it grounds to be banned. I can see how that might cause problems with prices like 19,900, but not with anything below one dollar difference. If you are a laissez-faire fellow such as myself who might believe that it is the store's natural right to set whatever price it wants for whatever reason, then fine, although it would be very low on the priority list of excessive regulations. But it would at least call for some sort of consumer action or boycott. And if you believe this is too small of an issue to write laws or organize rallies against, then that's also fine, but then you at least have to admit that this is still completely undesirable and dishonorable, at least on a miniscule scale.

Darth Vader is always seen as the ultimate badass. A tall powerful Sith lord with an awesome personal ship and his own Star Destroyer. He is the epitome of an intergalactic villain. However, I'd say that according to the traditional Sith myths (including the Bane and post-Bane era), he was the least influential and least \"Sith\" out of everyone. Every memorable Sith lord before him had some kind of ambition that lead them to where they were. Bane created the rule of 2 and started building a vast informationmoney network for generations to come. He also restored a ton of old Sith lore and knowledge. Plagueis learned how to bring people back to life and used his power to manipulate Palpatine into Chancellorship. Sidious..well, he created the Empire. Vader on the other hand is a manipulated victim of his circumstances and while he did strike fear into the hearts of the citizens of the Empire, he didn't contribute much as a Sith lord. He didn't expand the Sith rule, nor did he learn anything new, nor did he have any drive whatsoever to do anything. When Vader originally turned, it was partially because he wanted to have power like Plagueis (to restore the newly dead and prolong life) but he immediately dropped it after his beloved's death. We saw Vader try to overtake Emperor but with someone else's help. It's like he didn't crave the Sith Lord mantle, he just wanted to get rid of his maniacal master. We all know he's a skilled mechanic and pilot but he didn't do anything with that. Out of all the Sith, he could have restored the use of Force-infused craftsmanship but he didn't. As a Sith pilot, he could have explored unknown reaches of the galaxy and expand the Empire's influence beyond known galactic space (finding new hyper routes, enslaving nations, etc.) but he didn't.

The transaction was complete and she had control. If the coffee had been spilled during the handover I would view it the other way around. There are two arguments that I reject. I reject that the severity of the injury affects the responsibility. Comments such as \"have you seen those injuries, they're horrific, she had to be reconstructed\" are common. This is true, they were appalling injuries. But I think this is a strawman argument because my point is that it was not McDonald's responsibility after the handover, not that the injuries were minor. I reject that the coffee was too hot. These are hot drinks. It's obvious to me, and I would hope anyone who intends to drink such a drink that it would be hot and care should be given.

{"original_text": "My premises might be controversial but discussing them at length would be a bit of a tangent. So in brief, this is where I'm coming from: I believe that there is nothing inherently wrong with GMOs as a technology, and that the science is pretty clear that GMOs are no more more harmful than normal crops. To quickly quote Wikipedia: [There is broad scientific consensus that food on the market derived from GM crops pose no greater risk than conventional food.[1234567] No reports of ill effects have been documented in the human population from GM food.[489 Conversely, just for the sake of perspective, note that crops developed using perfectly natural, conventional breeding methods can be very harmful to human health, such as the [Lenape potato.] So even if any GMOs have been found to be harmful, this would be by no means something unique to GMOs. So, what about labelling? Doesn't everyone have a right to know what's in their food anyway? Well, I hold that labelling a product simply with \"contains GMOs\" doesn't actually tell you anything about what's in your food or where it comes from. \"GMO\" is not a category that describes any property of any specific plant. Ten different GMOs can be ten completely unrelated species modified with ten completely unrelated sets of genes, so any judgement on safety or nutritional value can only be done on a case-by-case basis, much like \"natural\" strains of crops. Therefore, I think that GMO labelling only encourages people intending to make purchasing decisions based on irrational and unscientific reasons. As such, it is not something that should be enforced by law. If you really want to make detailed purchasing decisions, then I suggest perhaps campaigning to label products with specific strains used, whether they are GMOs or not. And of course nothing is stopping you from only buying from companies that voluntarily advertise that their products containing no GMOs.", "text_perturb": "My premises might be controversial but talk over them at length would be a bit of a tangent.

[ 489 Conversely , just for the sake of perspective , note that crops developed using absolutely natural , conventional breeding methods can be very harmful to human health , such as the [ Lenape potato. ] So even if any GMOs have exist found to be harmful , this would be by no means something unique to GMOs. So , what about labelling ? Does n't everyone have a right to know what 's in their food anyway ? Well , I take for that labelling a product simply with `` contains GMOs '' does n't actually tell you anything about what 's in your food or where it comes from. `` GMO '' is not a family that describes any property of any specific plant. Ten different GMOs can be ten completely unrelated metal money modified with ten completely unrelated sets of genes , so any judgement on safety or nutritional value can only be done on a case-by-case basis , much like `` natural '' strains of crops. Therefore , I think that GMO labelling only encourages people mean to make purchasing decisions based on irrational and unscientific reasons. As such , it is not something that should be enforced by police force. If you really want to make detailed purchasing decisions , then I advise perhaps campaigning to label products with specific strains used , whether they are GMOs or not. And of course nothing is stopping you from only buying from companies that voluntarily publicize that their products containing no GMOs. ", "label": 1}
{"original_text": "Uber is having a very public fight right now with NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, basically arguing that they should be allowed to compete with yellow cabs in a free market and that consumers should have a choice. I would find this argument much more convincing if Uber weren't exempt from almost every rule and regulation by which the TLC governs traditional taxi services, on dubious legal grounds. Yellow (and green) cabs in NYC must comply with many rules, including car safety inspections, emissions checks and other environmental regulations, and driver background checks. Whether you agree with these rules or not (and I certainly have some questions about some of them), the fact remains that they are expensive to follow and that cost is of course passed on to the consumer by the cabs. Uber is not competing in a free market at all, in the sense of operating more efficiently to offer a lower price they're just gouging their competition by flouting the law. If Uber (or anyone else) disagrees with these laws (such as the regulation of fares), they can of course use the political process to try to get them changed, but in that case they should be changed for regular cabs also. There should never be a situation where there is one set of rules and regulations for regular cabs and a separate set for Uber. Uber is not and should not be above the law, no matter how cool and \"disruptive\" they might think they are. TO BE CLEAR: I am not arguing for or against any particular regulation.

{"original_text": "Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to 15hour. While many would expect this to strengthen the lower class and only decreasing the wealth of the upper class, I feel as if it would end up hurting those it is meant to help. These company's would now have to spend much more of their budget on paying employees, and it's not as if they're going to magically have more money. I understand that the increase of wealth in the lower class would eventually circulate back to the business's, but I highly doubt it would be enough to make up for the increased wages of their employees, and it definitely wouldn't happen right away. Since I highly doubt the CEO or other upper management would take cuts from their pay to make up for this, that leaves two possible solutions that I can see: The first would be to decrease the amount of employees. If approximately an equal percentage of employees are let go to the increase in pay the company will be able to function without upper management having to take a pay cut. While those who are able to keep there jobs would be greatly helped by this, for the most part it would just increase the unemployment rate; with these lay offs happening in a large portion of minimum wag paying company's there would be no demand for jobs while the supply would be sky rocketing.

{"original_text": "A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a Uzi submachine gun on full automatic. From some comments various people have left on this and the reporting it seems that it is not unusual for kids even younger then that to shoot real firearms. This is ridiculous. Children (and I define that in this case as everyone under 18) are not nearly responsible enough to handle them. There is a reason we do not let little children drive cars or drink alcohol etc. Childrens Brains (and even young adult's, but you have to draw the line somewhere) are still in the process of developing. We all have done stupid shit as children. Hell, just here on reddit I read about some guy who shot his brother twice as a kid. You may choose not be believe that story, but for me it seems plausible. I know btw that the Instructor in this case made some critical mistakes as well, and that children shooting firearms have to be supervised. But still, if the Girl had the experiance, wisdom and patience that comes with being an adult, this would have never happened. An adult acts as another layer of protection to prevent an accident. In my view, having a child handle a firearm is a little like not exercising proper trigger discipline. If you do everything else right, nothing bad can really happen. But you should never rely on doing everything else right. You might know some very mature and patient 14 year old who is really interested in hunting or sport shooting. In that case, congratulations. But I still stand by my view that that kid should wait and grow four more years. Sure, they might not get to shoot for four your years, but nobody will die. EDIT: ucaw81 has slightly changed my view.

{"original_text": "To me growth of economy is a meaningless statistic. Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange. What kind of person evaluates actions in their personal life based on this kind of statistic? For example, picking blueberries in the forest is extremely bad for growth of economy: low skill job and doing things yourself means you won't be buying blueberries from other people. Growth of economy means one should buy processed, marketed, branded food producs in the store and abandon working electronic devices whenever a new model comes to market. One could do that, yes, but I find it laughable how this is the priority goal for politicians - not health, literacy, justice, equality or some other virtue.

{"original_text": "Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a pedantic point. Please don't let it dissuade you from answering. Also, the title should read: \"there is no consistent moral framework.\" The mere existence of a framework is not a very interesting point to debate. A few things first: I do eat meat, and I don't want have sex with animals. I believe both eating meat and having sex with animals are wrong. I think that the reason that I eat meat despite believing it is wrong is that it's simply what I've been doing my whole life. Okay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry. Consider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: How can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus? I don't see a justification for either behavior on'natural' grounds because while I think that both the consumption of meat and the desire to have sex with animals can come about naturally (that is to say, not artificially) there are plenty of things which occur naturally (rape, infanticide, kidnapping) that we all agree are immoral. After giving out three deltas, I think my view on the question as I posed it has been changed.

I also don't think that crisis hotlines are unnecessary or should be eliminated, because they very obviously help people. Those who are legitimately suicidal as I'm defining it in this post are those who actually want to die, and have a rational reason for doing so, rather than simply acting on impulse or using death as an escape from an acutely stressful situation. The duration of time that someone has a suicidal with isn't necessarily indicative of whether their wish to die is legitimate or not, but I think that having time to consider a decision and its alternatives generally helps with rationality. I also don't intend to claim that depression is a necessity for being suicidal or \"legitimately suicidal,\" although I'm sure it increases the likelihood of being so. Also, downvotes don't change views, people. I've suffered from very severe depression for most of my life, and have considered suicide quite frequently. One of the things people like to throw out is contact information to suicide hotlines, but they've never been helpful to me. My personal experience aside, I really don't see how these crisis hotlines could help someone who legitimately wants to die (as opposed to someone who uses suicide or self-harm as an escape from acutely painful emotions or a stressful situation). If you were set on dying, then why would you want to call a hotline like that in the first place? I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error. Calling a hotline is also not going to change any of the external factors that would lead up to someone being suicidal. Perhaps they would help the person consider their issues in a different light, but again I think that's evidence of poor stress management. I can't make any statements to whether or not my personal suicidal wishes are \"legitimate\" or not because there is always the looming possibility that my mental illness is clouding my judgement to some extent, but I think that it's theoretically possible that someone would want to die on a rational basis. I also don't think that suicide hotlines are generally helpful for the chronically depressed, but that's only tangential to my main argument. Once you're mentally ill for a long period of time, (I think the issue of mental illness and consent become very clouded, if for no other reason than it's impractical to deny someone consent for the majority of their lives because of a mental health condition.)

The complaint about this is that once this starts happening the landlords in that neighborhood start to drive rent up, hurting the poor, original residents of that neighborhood, and it's said that the new young white residents intrude on the original neighborhood culture, replacing it with their own, and drawing the attention of homogenizing businesses.

Now the current generation is trying to rediscover America's cities and since no one likes paying 2000month for a studio apartment they are moving into the neighborhoods that have the proximity to the city life they want without paying an arm and a leg for it and since previous generations of middle-class Americans seemed unwilling to live alongside the working class shouldn't this change in attitudes be applauded rather than derided?

This post is about the following: Often times someone might make the argument \"if you're not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about\" defending government collection of data. To counter people will bring up the \"bathroom lock\" analogy: We all lock the door when we go to the bathroom even though what we're doing is not inherently wrong. My problem with this is that it is actually arguable that bathroom locks are an analogy in FAVOUR of \"government back doors.\" Most bathroom locks are not designed to keep intruders out - they are designed to make sure someone doesn't accidentally walk in on you. But in fact it is common to see in bathroom locks a very simple unlocking mechanism - one that can be unlocked simply by pressing a bobby pin in the hole.

The dog-biting problem might not be as bad as I perceived it to be, especially in public spaces. So one could argue that a leash and breeding documentation is enough to have appropiate security. I really don't trust leashes when I cross a dog on the walkway and I feel like owners are really lax about them where I live. This belongs in their responsibilty, though. Anyway, I really enjoyed the little discussion with you guys. I consider my first CMV to be quite succesful:) I'll be giving out Deltas as soon as I figured out how.In germany there is a movement that demands muzzles only for especially \"aggressive\" breeds of dogs and every dogs' origin should be tested. Sounds like a good compromise for me. Hello there. I'm no native speaker so please have mercy:) After trying to be rational about this topic for a long time, I could only come up with the opinion stated in the headline. Dogs in public places with a jaw strong enough to harm children should always wear a muzzle. By law. Here's my explanation: Dog owners tend to trust their dogs and they trust themselves in knowing their dog's behaviour. They expose other people's integrity to their personal, arbitrary judgement call. Walking a dog in public, even on a leash, is essentially not different from holding a loaded gun in public without the intention to do harm. People would still avoid to be in shooting range. Why do people not shy away from dogs in the same way? This is because they've made good experiences with dogs before and therefore underestimate the potential danger by a great margin. People who have been bitten will usually never trust big dogs again and will find that they changed their mind a little too late. Unmuzzled dogs on sidewalks or in parks are traumatic encounters for victims of dog bites. There is also the problem of appropiate conviction. The guy who purposefully carried a loaded gun in public and then killed someone by slipping his finger is much easier to convict than a dog owner whose only mistake was a short lack of attention for his dog. Should the dog owner be convicted with manslaughter? I know I wouldn't be able to lock someone up for this long only because he didn't pay attention. This is because there was no law protecting the dog owner from endangering other people in the first place. The idiot carrying the gun knew he was breaking the law the moment he stepped out the door. The dog owner didn't. After reading this you probably think that either I've been bitten by a dog or that I'm a dog-hating cat person. I'm neither. To be honest I think that muzzles on dogs look very sad and I would rather have a better soultion for all this. However, I have a huge hate for frivolous dog owners who think that because they're not scared of their dog, I shouldn't be either. So please change my view.:) Hello, users of CMV!

{"original_text": "I really don't care what team he bats for, and i don't wanna know. Everyone preaches equality... but nobody would care about him if he was straight. Dude's a 7th round pick, until he does something significant, can we treat him equally like all other 7th round picks and ignore him? Manziel is a Heisman winner, Clowney went 1. Sam..... what's he actually accomplished? If I were a GM I would hesitate to draft him, not because he's gay, but because he attracts a lot of undue attention, without the proportional amount of on field impact (see: tebow). Okay, I get it, he's \"breaking barriers\" as the first gay NFL player... cool, good for him, this was a story about 3 months ago. Same with Jason Collins, a marginal talent who struggled to make a roster getting undue hype. Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier AND was actually good (MVP, All-Star, Steals champ, etc). On top of that, its not like there's been any rule against gay people playing football (statistically, I would guess he isn't even the actual first). Dude was perfectly fine being gay and playing college ball. I doubt any fans cared about who he was in a relationship with. Jason Collins played about 10 years in the league being gay without anyone having any problems. But no, they decided they needed to call a national press conference and announce it to the world that he's gay. you don't see any straight people doing silly shit like calling press conferences to announce themselves straight. it's a publicity stunt, pure and simple. Who you're seeing isn't anyone's business, but these characters seem to find the need to shove it down all our throats (pause s) while at the same time complaining that they aren't being treated fairly. Fast forward a couple months, and what part of this is actually news? Nothing. He actually got drafted? cool. what would have been a bigger story, him getting drafted in the 7th round or not being drafted at all? it would have been a huge story either way even though nothing of significance has happened. it was a publicity stunt and I dont believe that crap about him wanting to be known as just a \"football player\" and not a \"gay football player.\" Son, if that was true, you would have kept your mouth shut and not actively advertised the fact and not decided to use the national media as the platform to come out of the closet. I question why a 7th round pick is the top story on both rnfl and espn.com (with the draft NBANHL playoffs going on) I'm not homophobic and dont have anything against him being gay. my point is that I don't care. Let me paint my point of view for you: I'm a redskins fan; lets go down the list: QB: RG3: SO - Rebecca Liddicoat Griffin (M) RB: ALfred Morris: SO - ??? WR: Pierre Garcon: SO - ??? WR: DeSean Jackson: SO - ??? WR: Santana Moss: SO - ??? LB: Brian Orakpo: SO - ??? LB: Ryan Kerrigan: SO - ??? CB: Deangelo Hall: SO - (M) Only that he's marriedstraight, saw some family vaca pics on IG of the wife kids RB: Clinton Portis: SO - ??? TE: Chris Cooley: SO - ??? FS: Sean Taylor (All-Time Favorite Player): SO - ??? only that he had a GF daughter from the murder reports QB: Peyton Manning (MVP): SO - ??? QB: Tom Brady: SO - Giselse (M) QB: Aaron Rodgers: SO - ??? QB: Andrew Luck: SO - ??? QB: Tony Romo: SO - ??? ex: Jessica SImpson (a big reason why nobody likes Romo outside of DAL, too much extracurricular info and not enough playoff wins app's) RB: Adrian Peterson: SO - ??? .... on and on. Point being, nobody really cares pays attention to who athletes' SOs are (unless they're celebs themselves). We know about RG3 and Rebecca in DMV cause its friggin RG3, Franchise Savior, and literally every skins fan did a thorough background check on him the minute that trade went down, and in the weeks beforeafter. Any one of those ??? people could be gay for all I know. All of them are more accomplished than this dude. What's preventing a gay athlete from keeping his personal life on the DL like 90 of the rest of the league? THAT's what I mean about shoving it down our throats. If you need to come out to your family and friends, fine, go for it, do you. If it comes up in the locker room and a teammate asks, fine, tell them, be yourself and all that. None of that requires setting up interviews and going through the press. If someone you mention to announces it to the press and word gets out, fine, dont deny it, and proceed to do all the interviews. Its the fact that these guys are tooting their own horns that I have a problem with that makes it a publicity stunt. As far as setting an example for others like you to look up to..? I don't buy that. Yeah, maybe, but there are plenty of other celebs a lot more accomplished, famous, and successful than this dude who are openly gay. If I'm a gay person, I'm not looking up to Sam and Collins and tryna be like them, I'm looking up to people like Ellen, Anderson Cooper, NPH, Ellen Page, Elton John, etc. It's like a young black kid looking up to kwame brown instead of michael jordan. Was kwame the first (black or otherwise) kid to get drafted 1 straight outta high school? yup. do any young black high school kids look up to him? doubtful. is it hard to be a young black kid and do you still get crap from society and the system for being so? undoubtedly. can you get killed in america for being a young black kid while your killer not only walks free, but cashes in on it? yup. does that make kwame brown relevant to anyone outside of rnbacirclejerk? you tell me. yet somehow, this is still the 1 story in sports right now apparently. the media hype machine is at fault for making a bigger deal out of this than it should be (it was news in february; nothing groundbreaking has happened since). IMO sam is at fault because the way I see it, it was a publicity stunt. if you wanna try to change my opinion on that, i'm all ears and open mind. again, I have nothing against him being gay. I have something against it being news on all the major sports news sources. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"original_text": "First off let me reiterate that I am talking about the ACADEMIC study of religion. I could give a fuck about theology and dogmatic tradition. What I care about is the philosophical core of religion: understanding and bringing about religious experience. The first thing that brings me to this idea is that, contrary to popular belief, science in no way has ever claimed it was truth. People have decided that it was, but all science does is create a model to make predictions. If those predictions work, then we can create tools with the model. We know very well that quantum mechanics and relativity theory are not \"true\" because they are incompatible. What they do is allow us to make predictions and therefore tools. These tools have helped us out, no doubt. But I believe that we need to shift our entire way of thinking from an understanding nature to an experiential nature. My favorite scientist, Werner Heisenberg, has this to say about it: \"The existing scientific concepts cover always only a very limited part of reality, and the other part that has not yet been understood is infinite.\" The other part is infinite. We can either keep going down a path of trying to figure out this fractal-like void of knowledge, which we are not capable in the least of doing biologically, or we can try to experience rather than understand our existence. This is done through the study of religions. Religions are all an attempt to explain an experience or set of experiences that people have. This includes Judeo-Christian, Pagan, Eastern, any sort of thought. What they are all attempting to do, at their core, is bring about the experience of something. Judeo-Christian thought wants to bring about heaven, and as Jesus says in the Gospel of Thomas (which is just as legitimate as any other text) the kingdom of heaven is here. The Qu'ran says turn your head in every direction and there you see the face of Allah. Buddhism speaks of Nirvana, Hinduism speaks of Moksha, Taoism of the sage, all of these are experiences of the one-like nature of the universe. That brings us back to Heisenberg \"There is a fundamental error in separating the parts from the whole, the mistake of atomizing what should not be atomized. Unity and complementarity constitute reality.\" Science, religion, they all talk about the unity. What we cannot do, according to Heisenberg and science, is understand. We can, as he says \"speak of it in images and parables.\" Sounds a lot like religion. We can understand that the big picture is completely unfathomable, and realize that what we really should do is experience the big picture through the study of religion. Maybe this is Judeo-Christian charity. Maybe this is Eastern meditation. Maybe its a good fuck or a nice view or dancing around. I don't care what your method of experience is, but religions are the study of this experience. They provide ways to bring about the experience. These experiences are just as \"real\" as anything else. You simply cannot say that I have not had religious, unexplainable (other than what I would call magic) experiences with the love of my life on top of a skyscraper in Tokyo 15,000 miles away from home. You cannot say that Ayrton Senna did not \"see god\" as he says all the time about him winning F1 races. You cannot say that someone dancing around losing themselves completely on acid at a Grateful Dead show did not have an unexplainable religious experience. These experiences are all real, and are all attempted to be explained by religious studies. Maybe Senna did not see a Christian god. But he had a religious experience, he experienced something and attempted to explain it with is home tradition that he had heard his entire life. The academic study of religion is important to this entire realm of experience. We need to study these experiences, and maybe even make them our goal as a culture. I am not saying science sucks and we should abandon it. It creates great tools and has helped us immensely. But it is an upaya, (in the Buddhist term) a tool. It is a great thing, but we cannot lose sight of the equally sized realm of experience that is studied through religion. Religious study is also upaya, and we should use it where it is helpful.

THe trouble is, every last bit of news I hear about the current Middle East conflicts goes only to reinforce my ever-growing belief that the Kurds are the only group involved with any moral high ground. 1) The Kurds espouse a number of western values that are largely absent in the region. Only The Kurds and the (middle and lower class) Iranians show any tendency to respect women's rights or treat them as equals deserving of respect or status. The Kurds have women in their military, and even their conservative tribal organizations can have Matriarchs in charge of political and military decisions. 2) They care about more than just themselves. The Kurds have gone out of their way, at significant danger to themselves, to rescue other ethnic minorities in the region, including famously the Yazidis, who everyone else was more than happy to let ISIS literally murder, enslave, and rape at genocidal scales. 3) Their political opponents have all shown themselves to be monsters in the fullness of time. Turkey is key here. For a while Turkey managed to keep up quite a reputation as a modern secular-Islamic state.

{"original_text": "I'm generally a fan of the away goals rule: it encourages more attacking play, and makes the second leg of the tie exciting when a solitary goal can turn a loss into a win.

It's unfair that the away team in the second leg gets 30 extra minutes to score an away goal. If both teams score in extra time, the tie should go to penalty kicks, not go down as a win for whichever team was playing away from home in the second leg.

Over the weekend we were playing Mario Kart 64 and for as long as I can remember my go to character for Nintendo games has been Peach. There's really no particular reason I do this other than I seem to do the best with Peach. When I won the grand prix my girlfriend said \"Ugh, I hate Peach, she's such a weak and stereotypical female video game character.\" To which I jokingly replied \"Wow, that's a SUPER sexist thing to say, and she's obviously not that weak since I crushed you with her.\" And her response to that was \"Peach negatively reinforces the idea that women are weak and can only be saved by men in power like Mario.\" Then I made the mistake of saying \"Well I don't think that's true.\" We ended up getting into an argument over the portrayal of females in video games and how that perpetuates stereotypes in the real world. Her main argument was that most females in video games are portrayed as weak and need help from the male characters and this is detrimental to women in real life. There were two issues I had with her argument, the first one being that there are a TON of badass female characters in video games who don't need no man: Samus, Rosalina, ZeldaSheik, Palutena, Bayonetta, Lara Croft, Ellie from the last of us, and GLaDOS (just to get a female villain in there). She shrugged this off by saying it's still not enough because male protagonist characters outnumber female characters in video games. I feel like she wouldn't be happy unless the numbers of male and female characters are exactly equal. The second, and main issue I had with her argument is even if all female characters were represented as weak and helpless, I sincerely doubt there is any correlation between these characters and real world issues for women. For me video games are make believe, fiction, and stories. They're imaginary worlds with imaginary characters. Saying the portrayal of women in video games perpetuates real societal problems for women (like pay inequality) is about as absurd to me as saying violence in video games perpetuates violence in real life, which from what I can tell [has been thoroughly debunked] . Most reasonable people realize that women don't wear bright pink dresses, pick vegetables with faces out of the ground, and get kidnapped from a giant turtledinosaur hybrid. I provided my argument, and also said if Mario's and Peach's roles were reversed I could seriously not care less, as long as the game was still fun. Her response was \"You won't ever understand because you're a guy.\" I tried to continue on the debate but was met with the same response every time: \"You won't ever understand because you're a guy.\" So here I am trying to change my view, while I may not agree with the feminist issue of women in video games, I feel like I'm more empathetic than what my girlfriend is giving me credit for. Have there been studies done about the portrayal of women in video gamesstories and their effects on society? Is there any hard evidence for this correlation? EDIT: Yes, I get it, some people's feelings are hurt that Princess Peach is portrayed the way she is, and while making people upset IS a negative effect, this is not what I'm looking for.

{"original_text": "I believe that Congress should have only one chamber, rather than two, one with proportional representation (the House of Representatives), and one with fixed representation (the Senate). The process by which a bill goes through Congress seems to me to be unnecessarily complicated by having two chambers, and I believe the legislative process would run more smoothly with only one. As it stands, bills have to start in one chamber, then go to the other, then fly back and forth between them as many changes are made, sometimes only to be changed back, and multiple votes have to be taken when one would suffice. It gets particularly slow and unproductive when the chambers are controlled by opposite parties. I can't think of anything two chambers can do that one can't do better. Changes to bills can be good, but that can happen internally, it doesn't need to be external. There is no need to have different committees in different chambers, one set of committees in one chamber would suffice. One chamber suffices for floor debate, and, most importantly, one chamber is all that is needed to pass legislation and to represent the people. An extra chamber is nothing more than an extra complication, that slows the process but adds nothing to it to improve the quality of legislation, and just leads to more political theatre and less productivity. Obviously, such things will exist regardless, but the existence of two chambers exacerbates the problem. I just don't see any real advantage to this mess. Even the people who created this system didn't really desire two chambers, it was merely an acceptable sacrifice to reach a compromise between people desiring proportional and fixed representation. I think people would be able to understand the legislative process a lot better if it was clearer, and the process would overall just be more efficient with no loss in the quality of legislation. Note: I intentionally did not discuss which form of representation I would prefer, proportional, fixed, mixed, or other. I do have a preference, but I consider that a separate issue from the number of chambers. EDIT: I have been convinced that under our current system, this would not be feasible. However, I think that if elections were publicly funded, or some other means of comprehensive campaign finance reform, and gerrymandering were similarly eliminated, that it would then be beneficial to have a unicameral legislature, with the same proportional system as the House of Representatives. This would allow the voters to have the power they should have anyway that would be sufficient to help keep the system under control. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I do have a preference , but I consider that a separate issue from the numeral of chambers. EDIT : I have been convinced that under our current system , this would non be feasible. However , I think that if elections were in public funded , or some other means of comprehensive campaign finance reform , and gerrymandering were similarly eliminated , that it would then be beneficial to have a unicameral legislature , with the same proportional system as the House of Representatives. This would allow the voters to have got the power they should have got anyway that would be sufficient to help keep the system under control. hi , users of CMV !

{"original_text": "Before you downvote me, please hear me out and try to CMV with a well articulated comment. I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting people up with downvotes. I will try to explain my opinion. WARNING: looong rant ahead. I first watched Breaking Bad. I've never been into TV shows since they tend to be time consuming and (IMO) tend to appeal to a broader audience, but since everyone told me to watch it I did. There are definitely some high points in the show: Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Giancarlo Esposito gave terrific performances, and without them I think the show would not have had the success it had. Gus' arc is IMO the peak of the show, with Gus' back story and general awesomeness. The other characters though, feel irrelevant and without much to offer. There is the cop who conveniently discovers Heisenberg's identity on the toilet, his wife who is just.... There, and the same goes for Walter's son. Skylar is a hypocrite and exists only to judge others from her morality horse. The other villains are forgettable and the psycho that appears towards the end of the show is a convenient plot device to kill Jesse's love interest and doesn't have any interesting trait. He's completely unidimensional. In the end, the series felt like an action movie with a few interesting characters and some pretty good cinematography, but nothing mind blowing. I still liked it though and I can see why people like it but if this is considered the best TV show ever, then I question TV shows' quality. Now for Game of Thrones: I didn't read the books nor do I intend to unless it's significantly better than the show. I will try to keep my cool but I really DESPISE this show. I feel about it the same way I feel about Attack On Titan (yes, I hate that one too): interesting premise, terrible characters and pacing, and lots of CHEAP. SHOCK. VALUE. The show always goes for the most shocking outcomes for the sake of shock value. People praise this show for being unpredictable and killing off anyone without distinction. Yet all the people who die are COMPLETE FUCKING IDIOTS and their deaths feel forced to avoid, god forbid, that the story might start getting going. When the Stark guy knows the King's wife has an incestous affair and suspects her to have tried to kill a fucking child, the guy who loves his wife tells him not to trust him and his daughter tells him about people wanting him DEAD he just claims the Iron Throne without considering that maybe, just MAYBE, he could get arrestedkilled. He could singlehandedly fix the corruption of the South, or at least try to while others tried to kill him, but we can't have that, now can we? The story must keep not going anywhere. If his death could have been at least plausible then it would have been okay. Then there is the dragon girl, who gets married to someone she doesn't love, is raped and then just falls in love with him. Dafuq, Stockholm's syndrome maybe? And at the end of season 3 we have other Starks dying because they're complete fools. Marrying another woman when you have already promised to marry the daughter of a powerful ally sure is a bright move, Einstein! After that I just dropped the series. It's just like a soap opera, with tons of violence and sex, where characters who are considered \"grey\" are just flat without any interesting development other than the dwarf (I don't even remember those guys names) and maybe the Stark tomboy little girl and the Stark who is at the Night Watch. There is a woman with an incestous affair with his pretty brother, a king who likes drinking, eating and fucking, a king who's a naive imbecile, a dragon girl with Stockholm's syndrome who becomes a badass cuz DRAGONS, a psychopathic teen king who somehow still hasn't died in 3 seasons, a guy whose penis makes the thinking and dooms his family to death, etc. THIS is considered good TV.
