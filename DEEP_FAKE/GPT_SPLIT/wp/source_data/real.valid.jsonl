{"original_text": "Cricket and Nigeria may seem an incongruous pairing, but in Lagos many a weekend players in their colourful kit take to the crease on a dusty pitch in a fiercely competitive cricket league. \"This league actually boasts about 99 of the Nigerian national team,\" says Femi Solebo, who chairs the Club Cricket Committee Lagos and also plays for the Ibeju Lekki Cricket Club. Watching a game from the welcome shade of the pavilion, he occasionally shouts out instructions to his batsmen taking on Government College Ibadan in a 50-over game. \"Over the last three or four years Nigerian cricket has stepped up quite a lot and has allowed these guys here to show their stuff at an international level,\" he says. \"Recently the national team got promoted to division five in the World Cricket League, which is a huge achievement for us - we've never been there before in the history of Nigerian cricket.\" Mr Solebo, who first started playing cricket whilst at school in the UK, reckons that in a population of more than 170 million \"there must be a million or so followers of cricket in Nigeria quite easily.\" However, not many of them are at Tafawa Balewa Square Cricket Oval next to Lagos' dilapidated old racecourse. Besides a few team members on the stand and a man barbecuing meat, only a small group watches from deckchairs under a nearby tree, keeping refreshed with drinks from a cool box. Some of them turn out to be former Nigerian internationals - stalwarts of the game, some of whom are updating a chat group of enthusiasts with the latest scores by mobile phone. Femi Solebo, Club Cricket Committee Lagos chair: I joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me \"In our time we didn't have as much exposure as the current national team does, we were restricted in playing in just the West African region,\" says Barnaby Ephraim, who now helps administer the game in Lagos. He says it is the Lagos league, which was started more than 15 years ago, that has helped raise the profile of cricket and the opportunity to play it outside school and university. It is also tempering attitudes that see the game as elitist and old fashioned, with some schools - even the established private ones - not seeing the sport as a priority. And Mr Solebo admits it is difficult to rival football as there are not the fans to warrant tickets that would pay for the upkeep of a turf pitch. The ground the teams use is often rented out by the cash-strapped Nigerian Cricket Federation - and with upcoming elections, political rallies have recently been held here, playing havoc with the pitch, already like concrete after the dry Harmattan season. The game is also expensive for players given the kit needed. \"With soccer, all you need is just one ball and then you're away,\" says the 45-year-old. But he says whilst the league is sponsored by private individuals like him with a passion for the game, most of the 400 players in its two divisions are \"from the streets.\" The Ibeju Lekki club helps pay for either a player's education or vocational training - and subsidises kit and lunches. Kunle Adegbola, Nigerian cricket captain: Cricket is just evolving in Nigeria.... in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football \"Whatever it is they want to do, we'll fund that and insist that you can only be a member of this club if you have some kind of educational background - and that's what the other clubs try to do as well,\" says Mr Solebo, who runs a company that generates electricity. \"I joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me. \"Some of them are doing very well in university, some of them have left and are working now.\" A few of Lagos' cricketers have even gone professional, like Nigerian cricket captain Kunle Adegbola. The towering 33-year-old has come to practise for his Foundation Cricket Club in the nets ahead of a game the next day. When the season ends in April in Lagos he will head off to London, where he has played for Burgess Park and Blackheath cricket clubs in the past. He says with more awareness, spectators and sponsorship, he sees great things for Nigerian cricket. \"Cricket is just evolving in Nigeria.... in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football,\" he says. But the Lagosian cricketers know gaining such momentum will only be achieved with serious corporate sponsorship - which would be more likely if ongoing negotiations with a cable TV company bear fruit. So far TV executives have been reluctant to go ahead as they would prefer a national league. \"But we say that we can take it in phases, adopt Lagos first and then you can open up,\" says Mr Ephraim, vice-chair of the Lagos State Cricket Association which is also trying to rejuvenate youth interest in cricket. He says that unlike other states there are 35 schools in Lagos now playing cricket - with both boys and girls participating. Ibeju Lekki player Endurance Ofem agrees junior involvement is key to putting cricket on a football footing. But the former captain of the Nigerian side says offering national team players good welfare packages like those available to professional footballers is important too. \"If you do that, every youngster sees the reason to come and play cricket.\" For Mr Solebo, competing with football is not the issue - it is the cricket that matters. \"It makes me very proud that our efforts give people joy every weekend - they come here, play with passion and it's fantastic.\"", "text_perturb": "Cricket and Nigeria may seem an incongruous pairing , but in Lagos many a weekend players in their colourful kit take to the crease on a dusty pitch in a fiercely private enterprise cricket league. `` This league actually boasts about 99 of the nigerian national team , '' says Femi Solebo , who chairs the Club Cricket Committee Lagos and also plays for the Ibeju Lekki Cricket Club.

{"original_text": "The pop star was given the night's top honour for her multi-million selling record 25, but told the audience, \"I can't possibly accept this award.\" \"I'm very humbled and I'm very grateful, but Beyonce is the artist of my life.\" The British singer then appeared to break the award in two accidentally and offer a piece to her fellow nominee. Adele's victory over Beyonce is certain to boost complaints that the Grammys habitually overlook black artists. Several artists, including Frank Ocean and Kanye West, chose to skip this year's ceremony on that basis. Ocean even declined to submit his critically-acclaimed album, Blonde, for consideration, saying the Grammys did not \"seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down.\" Two years ago, West rushed onto the stage in protest when Beck's Morning Phase beat Beyonce's last LP in the best album race. However, Adele's 25 was by far the biggest-seller on this year's shortlist; outselling Beyonce's Lemonade by a factor of 10 to 1. It is unclear if Adele will officially reject her award. If she does, it would only be the second time in history that has happened. The last was in 1990, when Sinead O'Connor turned down best alternative album for I Do Not Want What I Have Not Got, claiming the ceremony was too \"commercialised.\" Main winners Whatever the outcome, Adele remains one of the night's biggest winners. She won five prizes in all, including three of the top four: Best album, song of the year and record of the year - the latter two both rewarding her 2015 comeback single, Hello. Chicago's Chance the Rapper also took three prizes, including best rap album for his self-released record Coloring Book. \"I know people think independence means you do it by yourself, but independence means freedom,\" he said as he picked up best new act at the start of the ceremony. Rock icon David Bowie won in each of the five categories he was nominated for, including best alternative album, for Blackstar, and best rock performance, for the album's title track. And Beyonce wasn't left completely empty-handed: she took home best urban contemporary album and best music video, for the politically-charged Formation. The star, who is pregnant with twins, also gave an ambitious and logistically complex performance of the songs Love Drought and Sandcastles, themed around the ideas of rebirth, regeneration and healing. Dressed in flowing, golden Egyptian robes and an elaborate headdress, she dedicated the performance to motherhood, proudly displaying her baby bump as she sang. But while Beyonce's performance was flawless, others were marred by technical issues. Lady Gaga duetted with Metallica on the song Moth to the Flame, but singer James Hetfield was inaudible throughout the first verse. He later sang cheek-to-cheek with Gaga, sharing her microphone, but angrily threw his guitar to one of his roadies at the end of the performance. Adele also went off-key during a tribute to George Michael, and tearfully asked if the song could be started again. It was, and she received a standing ovation for her troubles. Respects were paid to Sir George Martin, Leonard Cohen and other musicians we lost in 2016, while Bruno Mars honoured Prince by playing the star's trademark cloud guitar in a pitch-perfect rendition of Let's Go Crazy.

During the hearing, the judge was told that 42 fish were killed by the sewage after a \"large quantity\" of sewage filtered into Whitelake River.

The 2014 winner Vos won the 119km stage from Nottingham to Stoke in a sprint finish. Sunday's 113.2km final stage runs from Northampton to Kettering. Vos, who lost the yellow jersey to Armitstead on Friday, won in what was a reduced sprint, with only 20 riders at the front of the race to battle it out after the bulk of the day's climbing was packed into the second half of the stage. Boels Domans rider Armitstead had attacked along with Elisa Longo Borghini, Moolman-Pasio and Emma Johansson with a little under 20km remaining, catching and passing lone breakaway rider Emilia Fahlin. Armitstead said: \"The race stayed together until the climb and then me, Ashleigh and Elisa went on the second Queen of the Mountains [intermediate sprint]. Emilia was in no-man's land so she came back up to us. \"There was a bit of co-operation for maybe five kilometres and then Emma and Elisa started attacking.\" But the chasing pack, including Vos, battled back and caught them shortly before the 1km-to-go Flamme Rouge to set up the sprint finish. She added: \"In the final kilometres I could tell [the peloton] were coming back. \"Coming into the final kilometre there were a couple of turns with up-hill flickers and again Emma and Elisa were attacking, so it was just about covering them. \"As the group from behind pulled, I tried to put myself in a good position but got caught out a little bit on the last corner.\" Women's Tour 2016 - stage four result 1.

The coalition government rejected a minimum price for alcohol in 2013. Health ministers said they would look at the evidence carefully. The public health review says that alcohol is now more affordable and people are drinking more than they did 40 years ago, making it the leading risk factor for ill health, early death and disability in those aged 15 to 49 in England. More adults are non-drinkers but there are still more than 10 million people in England drinking at levels that could damage their health. The report suggests there were 167,000 years of working life lost to alcohol in 2015 - mainly among the young and middle-aged. It concludes that reducing the affordability of alcohol is the most cost-effective way of reducing alcohol harm.

{"original_text": "It was the famous Fairfield yard which took the Upper Clyde to great heights and worldwide prominence. The yard was founded in 1864 by William Elder, a talented marine engineer who developed the compound engine which transformed shipbuilding by allowing vessels to use fuel more efficiently and travel further. Under William Pearce from 1888, the company flourished, building luxurious ocean liners, steamers and naval ships for the world. At its peak before World War 1, the Fairfield shipyard was part of a local industry which directly employed 70,000 workers in 19 yards. The largest crane in the world, with a maximum lift capacity of 250 tons, was built at the Govan yard in 1911 and in the following year Fairfield had 12 ships under construction at the same time. The inter-war years saw a gradual decline but Clydeside's largest shipyard still built many famous ships and during wartime it was a major builder for the Royal Navy. But after World War 2, the decline set in swiftly and despite a major modernisation programme in the 1950s the yards of the Clyde were unable to compete with new shipbuilding superpowers such as Japan. By 1967 the receivers were called in and it looked as if the end had come for Fairfield and for shipbuilding in Govan. Sean Connery, at the height of his James Bond fame, made a documentary about problems besetting the yard, entitled The Bowler and the Bunnet. Among the footage of a community on the edge of oblivion was Connery riding a bicycle around empty shipyard fabrication sheds. The UK government's response to the crisis was to create the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS) in 1968, which had about 8,500 workers in five yards - Fairfield's and Stephens on the south bank, Connel's and Yarrow's on the north bank, and John Brown's at Clydebank. In 1971 UCS went into receivership and was refused a government loan. This led to one of the most famous episodes in industrial history - the work-in. The unions, led by Jimmy Reid and Jimmy Airlie, occupied the yard and made a demand of the then Conservative prime minister Edward Heath for the \"right to work.\" In February 1972, the government agreed to retain two yards, Yarrow at Scotstoun and Fairfield's at Govan. Fairfield's was formed into Govan Shipbuilders in 1972, which was itself later nationalised and subsumed into British Shipbuilders in 1977. The government of Margaret Thatcher broke up British Shipbuilders and denationalised it in 1988, when the former Fairfield yard was sold to the Norwegian Kvaerner group. Kvaerner took the yard through another modernisation programme to enable it to specialise in the construction of liquefied natural gas and chemical tankers. But in the late 1990s, the market became depressed and the yard had to find alternative contracts. The yard passed to BAE Systems in 1999 and has found work over the past decade making destroyers and aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy. BAE is a key partner in the construction of the two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers being built at the Portsmouth yard and in Scotland.

Deputy Interior Secretary Felipe Zamora Castro and the interior ministry's chief press officer Jose Alfredo Garcia Medina were also killed in the crash along with other government officials and the air force crew, Ms Sota said.

Ms Sota said the craft went down in the Xochimilco area, just south of Mexico City. By Ignacio de los ReyesBBC Mundo, Mexico Francisco Blake Mora was one of the president's right-hand men. Not only because he was in charge of domestic affairs, but also because he became one of the most strident voices of Mr Calderon's strategy against the drug cartels. In recent months, he helped co-ordinate the army, navy and federal police in the fight against drug trafficking in violence-torn cities like Veracruz or Acapulco. But his death could be a severe blow to Mr Calderon at a personal level too. Three years ago, one of the president's best friends, then Interior Secretary Juan Camilo Mourino, was killed in a plane crash in Mexico City. That accident was one of the saddest moments for Mr Calderon since he took power in 2006, he said. Mr Camilo Mourino was remembered by members of the cabinet, including Mr Blake Mora, this week. His last message on his Twitter account (FBlakeM) was actually dedicated to Mr Mourino. \"The cloudy conditions at the time certainly make you think about the probability of an accident,\" President Calderon said in a televised address. He said a thorough investigation of the accident was being launched and cancelled a trip to Hawaii for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum. US President Barack Obama called Mr Calderon to offer his condolences, a US government spokesman said. Mr Obama \"reinforced his commitment to the close partnership between the United States and Mexico in this difficult time,\" said US National Security Council spokesman Ben Rhodes. The interior secretary is Mexico's senior cabinet position and the top official after the president, with responsibility for domestic affairs and security. Mr Blake was Mr Calderon's fourth interior secretary. One of his predecessors, Juan Camilo Mourino, was killed in a plane crash in Mexico City three years ago. Mr Blake began his political career in the north-western border city of Tijuana in the mid-1990s, later serving as interior secretary for Baja California state. He also served as a federal congressman from Mr Calderon's National Action Party. He earned a reputation as being a hardliner in Mexico's struggle with drug cartels. Mr Blake Mora frequently travelled to cities badly affected by the cartels, such as Veracruz and Ciudad Juarez, to help co-ordinate the government's response.

{"original_text": "Yet again, you feel for the families of those killed on board, and the people that actually survived the ordeal. It seems never ending. In less than a year two Malaysian aircraft have been lost, with 537 people on board. The AirAsia accident - en route to Singapore in December - killed 162. It is not just the accidents. It's the fact that whole aircraft are going down without warning. You would be forgiven for thinking that flying is becoming more lethal. But you would be wrong. In fact, when you look at the number of crashes and fatalities compared to the huge number of people flying today (3.2 billion passengers last year), we are in a golden era of aircraft safety. According to safety analysts Ascend, 2014 was narrowly the safest year ever, with one fatal accident per 2.38 million flights, compared to every 1.91 million flights the year before. It must be noted that that does not include the loss of the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine, where 298 people died, which they count as a war loss rather than an accident. But even with that flight added it is not a terrible year, historically. Another respected organisation, the Aviation Safety Network, registers 21 fatal accidents in 2014 (this time including Ukraine), compared to 29 in 2013 and 23 the year before that. Nearly 1,000 people died in 2014, which is 700 more than the year before. Horrible numbers, but compare that to the worst year, 1972, when 2,370 passengers were killed - and far fewer people were flying then, maybe a quarter of the number travelling today. So why is flying getting safer? Well, technology. \"Think of your car in the 1970s,\" David Learmount, from Flightglobal tells me. \"The brakes, the handling, the lack of safety features. Well, aircraft are exactly the same. \"We knew most things about aerodynamics by the 1940s. What has changed is the technology.\" Every new generation of aircraft has been safer than the one before. Better computers, design, materials. But there is another sobering factor at play here too. Every tragedy has taught designers something new. Go back a couple of decades and the biggest killer was something called Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). A benign name with a morbid outcome, it normally involved a perfectly serviceable aircraft coming into land, then hitting something on the ground without the crew even knowing it was there. Many airports are near hills. Then along came a piece of equipment that was to transform safety: the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System. \"It's like a sat nav that can help you thread your way through hills and mountains, even in clouds,\" David says. Here is another example of how disaster has led to safer flying. In 1985 a British Airtours aircraft was taking off from Manchester Airport, en route to Corfu. The pilots aborted at the last minute because one of the engines failed, but the aircraft was also on fire. Fifty-four people died fleeing the smoke, the aisles were jammed with passengers panicking to get out. Next time you fly, look at the floor. You will probably see strip lights along both sides of the aisle, then they turn and lead to each exit. That idea comes straight from the Manchester fire. The lights mean passengers can find the exit, even crawling on their hands and knees through thick smoke. \"Our founder was actually working on emergency guide lights to help people escape from nuclear power stations and submarines,\" says Nigel Duncan, boss of STG aerospace. \"This accident made him realise they could be used in planes too.\" Nigel's company now supplies guiding lights for the floors of 9,000 airliners. They are photoluminescent, \"which means they are fail-safe.\" \"It's a chemical process so they don't need power - sever it and it still works,\" he says. For the most part, computers fly modern airliners. And they are very good at it. But all of this safety-driven automation has led to a new safety concern that is uncomfortable to hear. Pilots don't get enough practice at actually flying planes. The computer has taken them out of the loop. Six years ago, Air France flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic, killing 228 people. Yet there was nothing critically wrong with the plane. So why did it crash? Well, the weather was bad and a small tube froze up, knocking out the speed indicator. The actual speed was fine, but the speed data on their screens was all over the place. Suddenly, the computer didn't know how fast it was going, and it handed control back to the pilots. Confused, in bad weather, in darkness and taken by surprise, they couldn't work out what was happening, so they kept climbing to the point where the aircraft stalled, effectively stopping in mid-air and falling from the sky. Unsurprisingly, plenty in the industry want more hands-on training for pilots. \"A few years ago the airlines used to get more crew from the military and those guys were used to manually flying aircraft right on the edge,\" David Learmount tells me. \"Today, many pilots don't have that kind of background training.\" Having said all of that, just bear in mind: Nothing is ever without risk, but the chances of dying in an aircraft \"accident\" are lower than ever.", "text_perturb": "Yet once more , you feel for the families of those killed on board , and the people that actually survived the ordeal.

{"original_text": "It is a question that has long seemed impossible to answer, since players from different decades can never face each other at their peaks. Add in an element of nostalgia - who doesn't have a rose-tinted view of the teams they watched as a child? - plus the fact that fleeting glimpses of star players have been replaced by wall-to-wall television coverage, and it is quite a challenge to consider the merits of teams across eras. Here, with the help of SAM, the super computer built by Salford University professors Ian McHale, Rose Baker and others, BBC Sport assessed every side to have played an international match and analysed every international result. Taking into account a range of factors - including goals scored, goals conceded, the strength of the opposition faced and whether or not results were achieved in major tournaments - we have come up with the top 10 teams of all time. There are no English or Italian teams. As for the winners? You might well be surprised. Line-up: Sepp Maier, Berti Vogts, Franz Beckenbauer, Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck, Paul Breitner, Rainer Bonhof, Uli Hoeness, Wolfgang Overath, Jurgen Grabowski, Gerd Muller, Bernd Holzenbein. West Germany had come close to winning the World Cup twice in the preceding decade, losing 4-2 to England at Wembley in 1966 and 4-3 to Italy in a spectacular semi-final in Mexico four years later - so the stage was set for it to be third time lucky for veteran coach Helmut Schoen and his team as the host country in 1974. Media playback is not supported on this device They were guided on the pitch by an all-time great in the shape of Franz Beckenbauer. They had world-class defender Berti Vogts in their ranks. Wolfgang Overath was the midfield strategist and in attack they had the marksman supreme in Gerd Muller, scorer of 14 goals in 13 World Cup matches. Their meeting with the Netherlands in the final got off to the worst possible start when they conceded a first-minute penalty, but through sheer determination, and no little quality, they fought their way back to win through Paul Breitner's penalty and, inevitably, a winner from Muller. This West Germany side will not be remembered with the same fondness as some of the teams on this list but, like so many of their compatriots down the years, they got the job done. Line-up: Fabien Barthez, Lilian Thuram, Laurent Blanc, Marcel Desailly, Bixente Lizarazu, Patrick Vieira, Didier Deschamps, Youri Djorkaeff, Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry, Christophe Dugarry. Just look at that line-up! Built around star midfielder and three-time world player of the year Zinedine Zidane, this was the team that began the Euro 2000 final, a side so strong that two of Europe's finest players at the time, Robert Pires and David Trezeguet, could not get in the first XI. It was a group consisting largely of the players who won France's first World Cup in 1998, but with a few tweaks. Media playback is not supported on this device One, in particular, took the French to the next level. Out went striker Stephane Guivarc'h, scorer of just one goal in 14 internationals, and in came 22-year-old Thierry Henry, a forward who would go on to score 51 goals in an international career spanning 13 years. With Laurent Blanc in for Frank Leboeuf in defence, Patrick Vieira replacing Emmanuel Petit in midfield and attacker Christophe Dugarry taking Christian Karambeu's place, France became the first team in 26 years to win a World Cup and European Championship back-to-back - West Germany won the Euros in 1972 and followed that by claiming the 1974 World Cup. Line-up: Sergio Romero, Walter Samuel, Gabriel Heinze, Martin Demichelis, Nicolas Otamendi, Javier Mascherano, Maxi Rodriguez, Angel Di Maria, Gonzalo Higuain, Carlos Tevez, Lionel Messi. Think Argentina and the mind instantly conjures images of Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. Two iconic players, global superstars, both of whom led their sides to World Cup finals - Maradona winning one in 1986 and losing one in 1990, Messi losing out in 2014. But none of those three teams make it in to our top 10, and there is space for only one of Argentina's two most famous players. For all Maradona's individual brilliance, the 2010 side featuring Messi - as well as Carlos Tevez, Angel Di Maria and Gonzalo Higuain - are considered the best Argentina has produced. Bear in mind the fact Sergio Aguero was predominantly only a substitute and you get a sense of their attacking strength. \"To any football fan, it is odd that the results show that the 2010 team would beat the 1986 team,\" says Professor McHale. \"But there are some things that data and statistics can't pick up on - the human spirit, mental fortitude, attitude when things aren't going for you. There is only so much it can tell. \"The 1986 team lost 11 times in the three-year sample period, in part because they often played weakened teams in friendlies for a variety of reasons. That helps to explain why a team as brilliant as Maradona's 1986 side do not make the list.\" While Argentina 2010 are perhaps the surprise entry on this list, their results in the period suggest they deserve their place. Less than two months after Spain won the World Cup, the world champions were thrashed 4-1 in Buenos Aires, a result Argentina followed up two months later with a 1-0 win over Brazil. Line-up: Felix, Carlos Alberto, Everaldo, Brito, Piazza, Clodoaldo, Gerson, Jairzinho, Rivelino, Tostao, Pele. For many, the greatest team of all time. But not when judged by cold, hard stats. Pele led the way for Brazil during this period, but the names of his colleagues roll off the tongue as a list of the game's greats: captain Carlos Alberto, Gerson, Tostao, Jairzinho, Rivelino. Media playback is not supported on this device In 1970 alone, they played 14, won 12 and lost only once, scoring four or more goals five times. Therein lies part of the explanation as to why they do not feature further up the list - their opponents were often relatively weak, meaning victories earned them less credit in our ranking system. This team, though, were the stuff of fantasy, regrouping after a below-par performance in England four years earlier when Pele was kicked out of the tournament. Mexico 1970 was the great man's World Cup finale after his first win in Sweden in 1958 and he bade farewell in style. England pushed them closest in a classic group game in Guadalajara settled by Jairzinho's goal, and this was a team so good they were even able to carry a goalkeeping liability in Felix with no ill effects. The final against Italy in Mexico's Aztec Stadium was their showpiece. Goals from Pele, Gerson, Jairzinho and the brilliant flourish of passing to set up Carlos Alberto for the most famous goal in the 4-1 win was the crowning glory for an utterly brilliant side. Line-up: Jan Jongbloed, Ruud Krol, Wim Rijsbergen, Wim Suurbier, Wim Jansen, Arie Haan, Wim van Hanegem, Johan Neeskens, Johan Cruyff, Rob Rensenbrink, Johnny Rep. One of the greatest teams never to win the World Cup. The Dutch were masterly throughout the 1974 tournament, demonstrating a tactical and technical ability far above every other team, guided on the pitch by the brilliant Johan Cruyff and off it by the master of \"Total Football,\" the visionary coach Rinus Michels. Cruyff led a team full of talent in defender Ruud Krol, midfielders Arie Haan and Johan Neeskens as well as forwards Johnny Rep and Rob Rensenbrink. In the goalless draw against Sweden, the \"Cruyff turn\" was invented, as the great man bamboozled Jan Olsson with a piece of football ballet that will forever bear his name. The Netherlands then gave masterclasses against Argentina, who they beat 4-0, and the fading reigning champions Brazil, where they won 2-0. The victory was far more convincing than the scoreline suggests. There was a touch of arrogance about this side and it cost them in the final against West Germany in Munich. Instead of capitalising on Neeskens' first-minute penalty they wanted to humiliate their opponents - allowing the ruthless hosts to recover and claim the World Cup with a 2-1 win. Line-up: Manuel Neuer, Holger Badstuber, Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Philipp Lahm, Sami Khedira, Toni Kroos, Mesut Ozil, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Miroslav Klose, Thomas Muller This was the team that laid the foundations for the World Cup win that was to follow in 2014. A side which mixed the experience of Miroslav Klose (who would go on to become the all-time World Cup top scorer with 16 goals) and Bastian Schweinsteiger with a younger generation that included Manuel Neuer, Mesut Ozil and Thomas Muller, their quarter-final win against Greece at Euro 2012 was their 15th consecutive competitive victory. The defeat by Italy in the semi-finals of that tournament would prove to be little more than a blip, as Joachim Low's side embarked on a new run of 18 competitive matches unbeaten, a sequence which included a remarkable 7-1 thrashing of hosts Brazil and ended with a World Cup final victory against Argentina. Line-up: Julio Cesar, Dani Alves, Marcelo, Thiago Silva, David Luiz, Bernard, Paulinho, Oscar, Hulk, Neymar, Fred A year away from hosting their own World Cup, Brazil could hardly have been better positioned to succeed on home soil. An 11-game unbeaten run in 2013 culminated in five straight wins at the Confederations Cup, a tournament which doubled as a dry run for the main event the following summer. Not only did Brazil win that competition but they did so in style, beating France 3-0 and Italy 4-2 before hammering world and European champions Spain 3-0 in the final. They were the world's in-form team and, with Neymar as their talisman, continued their impressive record in to World Cup year, recording 10 wins in a row and 13 out of 14 in total. Yet for all that promise, this will be a team forever associated with one of the great humiliations in modern sport. A game away from a final at the Maracana in Rio, Brazil were 5-0 down to Germany in the semi-final inside 29 minutes and were eventually demolished 7-1. It was a one-off - Brazil went on to win 11 straight matches after the World Cup, including victories against Argentina and France - but that defeat by Germany is a result that will always define them. Line-up: Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Carles Puyol, Gerard Pique, Joan Capdevila, Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta, Xabi Alonso, Xavi, David Villa, Fernando Torres The inventors of tiki-taka, Spain imposed their own brand of football on the world from 2008 onwards, helped in no small part by the success of a Pep Guardiola-inspired Barcelona, whose players formed the core of the national team. With Andres Iniesta and Xavi the heartbeat of the side, Spain became the first team to win back-to-back European Championship titles (in 2008 and 2012), while they ended their wait for World Cup success when they became the first European nation to win the competition outside of their own continent by lifting the trophy in South Africa in 2010. It was a period of unprecedented dominance. Under Luis Aragones and then Vicente del Bosque, Spain set a new world record of 15 consecutive wins and went unbeaten for 35 matches. The team of 2010 boasts an 84 win percentage and the majority of the players above were involved in all three tournament successes, but that is not quite enough to make the top two. Line-up: Claudio Taffarel, Cafu, Roberto Carlos, Aldair, Marcio Santos, Dunga, Juninho, Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Bebeto, Romario Brazil went unbeaten from November 1993 to January 1996, a period stretching 28 games, taking in a World Cup win and including victories against Argentina (twice), Netherlands and England, among many others. Their scintillating form continued, as they lost just once in 20 matches in the 1996-97 season, a campaign which culminated in a Copa America triumph. Those runs are hardly surprising when you look at the players at manager Mario Zagallo's disposal - he had three of Brazil's six all-time leading goalscorers to choose from. Ronaldo, scorer of 15 World Cup goals, was just three years in to his international career in 1997, working his way into a team which could boast two of the leading scorers at the 1994 World Cup - Romario (five) and Bebeto (three). Not a bad array of attacking power. This side was made up of a group of players who won that World Cup and were beaten finalists in 1998 - a rare example of a team maintaining its strength over a four-year cycle and reaching consecutive finals. Line-up: Gyula Grosics, Jeno Buzanszky, Mihaly Lantos, Borzsei Janos, Jozsef Zakarias, Jozsef Bozsik, Zoltan Czibor, Ferenc Szusza, Ferenc Puskas, Nandor Hidegkuti, Sandor Kocsis Hungary, the best team of all time? Bear with us... The Mighty Magyars dominated world football in the early 1950s, inspired by the genius of Ferenc Puskas. This was a team embarking on a run of more than four years without defeat, and they would go on to reach the 1954 World Cup final. In 1953 they humiliated England, a stunning 6-3 victory at Wembley exposing the Three Lions' deficiencies as they lost a home game to a non-British or Irish team for the first time. England hoped for revenge in May of the following year in the return fixture but were left embarrassed once more as they were thrashed 7-1 in Budapest. So strong was the Puskas led-side that, in that summer's World Cup, they would beat West Germany 8-3 and South Korea 9-0 in surely the greatest show of group-stage strength even seen at a major tournament. They were only denied World Cup glory by the Miracle of Bern, with the West Germans defying the odds and memories of that heavy defeat weeks earlier to win the final 3-2 - after Hungary had gone 2-0 ahead in the opening 10 minutes. An ankle injury suffered by Puskas meant he was not fully fit in that game, hampering the Hungarians' attempts to cement their place as the world's greatest side. For Hungary, their team of the time was perhaps the ultimate example of a \"golden generation.\" As the graph below shows, it has pretty much been downhill ever since. Here's how the top three nations look when plotted alongside one another. No English team makes it into the top 10, but which Three Lions side does the super computer rate as the best? Despite the 1966 squad winning the World Cup, it is actually the team from 1986 that comes out as the strongest England has produced. With Gary Lineker the tournament's leading scorer, who knows how far they might have gone - and where they would appear in our top 10 - had Maradona and the Hand of God not intervened?

Line-up : Gyula Grosics , Jeno Buzanszky , Mihaly Lantos , Borzsei Janos , Jozsef Zakarias , Jozsef Bozsik , Zoltan Czibor , Ferenc Szusza , Ferenc Puskas , Nandor Hidegkuti , Sandor Kocsis Hungary , the best team of all clock time ? Bear with us. . . The Mighty Magyars dominated world football game in the early 1950s , inspired by the genius of Ferenc Puskas. This was a team embarking on a streak of more than four years without defeat , and they would go on to reach the 1954 World Cup final. In 1953 they humiliated England , a stunning 6-3 victory at Wembley exposing the Three Lions ' deficiencies as they lost a home game to a non-British or irish team for the first time. England hoped for revenge in May of the following year in the return fixture but were left embarrassed once more than as they were thrashed 7-1 in Budapest. So strong was the Puskas led-side that , in that summer 's World Cup , they would beat West Germany 8-3 and South Korea 9-0 in surely the greatest show of group-stage strength even view at a major tournament. They were only denied World Cup glory by the Miracle of Bern , with the West Germans defying the odds and memories of that heavy defeat weeks earlier to win the final 3-2 - after Hungary accept gone 2-0 ahead in the opening 10 minutes. An ankle injury suffered by Puskas meant he was not fully fit in that game , hampering the Hungarians ' attempts to cement their place as the world 's greatest side of meat. For Hungary , their team of the sentence was perhaps the ultimate example of a `` golden generation. `` As the graph below shows , it has pretty much live downhill ever since. Here 's how the top three nations wait when plotted alongside one another. No English team makes it into the top 10 , but which Three Lions side does the super computer rate as the best ? Despite the 1966 squad winning the existence Cup , it is actually the team from 1986 that comes out as the strongest England has produced. With Gary Lineker the tournament 's leading scorer , who have sex how far they might have gone - and where they would appear in our top 10 - had Maradona and the Hand of God not intervened ?

Scientists say their initial studies suggest that the object - catalogued as V774104 - is some 500-1,000km across. It will need to be tracked over time to learn the shape and extent of its orbit through the Solar System. The discovery was announced at the 47th annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences, taking place in National Harbor near Washington DC. The team behind the find is led by Scott Sheppard, from the Carnegie Institution for Science, and Chad Trujillo, from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. They specialise in detecting Solar System outliers. The previously recognised most distant object is the dwarf planet Eris. This body, which has a moon, Dysnomia, moves between 5.7 billion km and 14.6 billion km from the Sun. To put some of these numbers in context: Earth is 149 million km from the Sun, and even the most distant major planet - Neptune - seems close at 4.5 billion km, by these standards. That said, the Voyager 1 probe is further away - just. The epic robotic explorer has now ventured 20 billion km from home. The big question is whether V774104 sweeps inwards from its present location, like Eris, or outwards, like the objects known as 2012 VP113 and Sedna. These bodies are currently slightly closer in than Eris, but investigations of their orbits show they will reach far deeper into space, out to 66 billion km and 140 billion km, respectively. Models for Solar System formation suggest that such objects were probably not created in these weird, eccentric orbits. One explanation is that they have been perturbed gravitationally and pulled on to their strange trajectories by a passing planet - perhaps one that was expelled from our Solar System early in its history.

{"original_text": "Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region. For many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration. Mr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame. A mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught. To use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over. But he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore. The diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma. Since 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism. Domestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime. He was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship. His message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised \"lowlanders\" in Oromia and Ogadenia. His concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order. Measured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring. The much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele. But it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty. The democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed \"work in progress,\" has long stalled. Since the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents. Why West will miss Meles Obituary: Meles Zenawi Life in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi A plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time. Feeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival. He orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents. His death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising. That said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus. The opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up. Mr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically. He is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums. He did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable. Not in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse. From the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought. Many embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called \"new breed\" of African leaders. The Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests. He swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to \"tame\" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991. The two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea. Hostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border. It is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension. That would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond. In Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab.

He first noticed the issue in March 2014 and contacted Asda to report it. Asda said it had now fixed the problem and no customers had been affected. The firm, whose website is run by US retail giant Walmart, told the BBC: \"Asda and Walmart take the security of our websites very seriously. We are aware of the issue and have implemented changes to improve the security on our website.\" \"The points flagged pose a low risk to customers and our monitoring of these security issues indicate that no customer information has been compromised over that two-year period.\" Since Mr Moore went public with the information it has acted to improve its security. \"The small risk to customer information has been removed and an update has been applied, we're now adding further enhancements which will be completed by this evening. In short, one of the two issues is fixed but nothing that remains poses any risk to any customer information or card details,\" it told the BBC. The issue occurred because of two well-known exploits, cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), which combined, can offer hackers access to all the information users put on the site, said Mr Moore. It means that - if someone had both the Asda website open and another site that is infected with malware - they could be vulnerable to attack. \"CSRF exploits the trust a site has in the user's browser, allowing an attacker to issue requests on your behalf and from your own PC.

{"original_text": "Carlos Ghosn said there was a need to build a \"much higher awareness\" of the company's products in Brazil. When Nissan took the decision to back the Games, the Brazilian market was booming with sales of 3.8 million vehicles a year. But a recession has seen that sales figure tumble to 2 million a year. \"Without any doubt it's the right decision, the idea was to give more awareness to the Nissan brand,\" he told the BBC. The company's goal with the Olympics sponsorship is to help increase its market-share in Brazil from 3 to 5, he said. The 31st Olympic Games officially start in Rio on Friday with the opening ceremony at the Maracana Stadium. As part of its sponsorship, Nissan is supplying 5,000 cars for the Games and the Brazilian Olympic team to use. The company has used Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt in its adverts since 2012. Mr Ghosn says the global car market will continue to be sluggish until 2019, with growth of just 1 next year. He expects the US car market to be strong, and sees Europe continuing to recover \"even though it will be impacted by Brexit.\" The UK economy will see some contraction due to Brexit, \"not because there is anything wrong with the UK, but because markets hate uncertainty,\" Mr Ghosn said.

{"original_text": "As Abid Naseer started his cross-examination in a New York courtroom of the police officer who searched his Manchester bedroom in 2009, he commented it was nice to hear a Mancunian accent again. Six years ago, the Pakistani national had been living in the north-west English city where he plotted to kill hundreds in a bombing attack at the city centre's Arndale shopping complex during Easter weekend. Naseer, who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013, was convicted of providing and conspiring to provide material support to al-Qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device. Defending himself at his trial in New York, the 28-year-old was polite, calm and professional. He denied he was involved in any form of extremism. But, according to the police officer who headed up the British investigation into his activities, his courtroom conduct was a performance designed to con the jury. In a cafe overlooking the Brooklyn courthouse where the trial was held, Det Supt Mark Smith said Naseer was a good actor, an al-Qaeda trained terrorist and a man with a determination to kill hundreds of people. He said: \"He has had lots of time to develop his Westernised social skills, but I would say don't be fooled. Beneath that cool, relaxed exterior is a cold, calculated terrorist.\" Held in custody in the US ahead of his trial, Naseer had spent the months preparing his legal case and working out. One police officer commented that he had doubled in size since he was handcuffed and led away from a Cheetham Hill house in April 2009. Were it not for his arrest, detectives are convinced he would have gone ahead with a \"mass-casualty\" attack in Manchester city centre. Based upon intelligence gathered and the plots devised by other terrorists trained at the same al-Qaeda camp in Pakistan, police have pieced together what they believe would have happened. Emails sent from an internet cafe near Naseer's home had been intercepted in the weeks before his arrest. The final message led police to believe an attack was imminent. Known as the \"Hi Buddy\" email because of the way it greeted an al-Qaeda operative, it reads: \"I met with Nadia family and we both parties have agreed to conduct the nikah after the 15th and before 20th of this month. I have confirmed the dates from them and they said you should be ready between these dates.\" The jury was told female names, including Nadia, represented different ingredients used to make bombs. Wedding, or'nikah', was a standard al-Qaeda code for a terror attack. Based on the Islamic calendar, investigators believed this email was referring to a planned attack during the Easter weekend in 2009. Other evidence included photos of Naseer's friends standing in front of the main entrances to the Arndale centre. He claimed they were innocent pictures as they travelled around Manchester. But retired Det Ch Insp Allan Donoghue described the images as \"hostile reconnaissance.\" He said: \"That for me was the most alarming thing. To see each entrance of the Arndale Centre being photographed... that was clearly a means by which they would brief the would-be attackers as to what they would see as they made their approaches.\" Police think the first target would have been the Arndale Centre, which had been rebuilt following the IRA bomb attack on Manchester in 1996. The terrorists would have walked in carrying bombs made out of fizzy drink bottles in rucksacks or specially modified T-shirts. After the first wave of explosions, there would have been a second attack with more suicide bombers waiting in St Anne's Square for the rush of shoppers trying to escape. The target was chosen by al-Qaeda leaders because of the financial impact as well as the huge number of potential victims. According to Dr David Lowe, a retired special branch officer who now teaches law at John Moores University in Liverpool, it would have been a devastating attack. He said: \"It would have potentially been bigger than the 77 attack in London. It would have sent shockwaves around the world. And it would have shown that not just capital cities are targets.\" The scale of the potential disaster is something the man who led the police investigation is well aware of.

{"original_text": "But many of the people using the health service in England or Northern Ireland on Monday morning may not have noticed a huge difference. Why? Walkouts in the NHS are quite different from other sectors. When tube drivers, council staff or teachers strike the aim is to cause disruption. It is the first rule of industrial action: make your contribution count. However, the terms of engagement are somewhat different when NHS workers take part. While unions members want to make a point, they commit to not harming urgent and emergency services. Ahead of this week's action local union officials held talks with managers to plan services - as they did before the walkout on 17 October. It means there are likely to have been many staff in work who supported the strike but have agreed to keep working. Midwives are a classic example of this. The Royal College of Midwives has promised to keep maternity units running and so well over half of their members are believed to have worked. And even where staff have walked out, there appears to have been a willingness to leave the picket lines when there has been a need. In a word, pay. Ministers in England and Northern Ireland have awarded NHS staff a 1 increase, but only for those without automatic progression-in-the-job rises. These, designed to reward professional development, are given to about half of staff and are worth 3 a year on average. What is more, the offer is \"non-consolidated,\" which means it is taken away at the end of the year, meaning their pay packet returns back to the 2013-14 level, and does not count towards staff pensions. An independent pay review board had said the 1 increase should be across the board and paid in full as normal. Next year it has been suggested those not getting a progression-in-the job rise get 2, but again it should be non-consolidated. But in Scotland a 1 pay rise was given to everyone and in Wales a deal was reached last week after ministers agreed to pay 1 next year, while giving extra help to the lowest paid this year. It means the disruption during both strikes seems to have been limited to areas such as outpatient appointments and community clinics. And it is why unions are able to claim strong support for the walkout, while NHS England releases figures suggesting only about 12,500 staff - about one in 35 - did not turn up for work. But with the strike now ended, attention turns to what happens next. The simple answer is a period of work-to-rule. Members from the nine unions involved in the walkout are expected to take steps such as refusing to do unpaid overtime and insisting on taking their breaks. They may be joined by another two unions. However, as far as an end to this dispute, a solution seems some way off. As the walkout was coming to an end, unions were already telling me they would be sitting down to discuss future action. There was a meeting between the strike in October and this one, but it is thought little progress was made with the government maintaining giving a 1 pay rise on top of the progression-in-the-job pay rises was simply not affordable. Unions have been told that they are free to come up with another solution, but that there is no more money for pay. That means making some kind of compromise on the progression-in-the-job element. These can be extremely lucrative - for senior nurses and midwives they are worth??10,000 - so understandably staff are unwilling to give them up. But to understand the cause of this dispute you really need to go back to 2009. That was the year the then NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson set the health service an ambitious savings target. The NHS was told to save??20bn by 2014 - later pushed back to 2015. Sir David was adamant, though, it could not simply be achieved through cuts, but rather it had to come from efficiency savings. It works out as a productivity gain of between 4 and 5 a year - something the health service had never done before. Unsurprisingly, it has turned out to be just as difficult as expected. A report by MPs earlier this year showed significant inroads had been made, but the majority of these had not come from efficiency savings. Instead, the NHS had relied on \"quick fixes\" - namely pay restraint. Over the last four years there have been two years of freezes and two of small rises. That has had a significant impact on the pockets of health workers. Figures from Unison suggest health worker pay has fallen by 10 during this period once inflation is taken into account. But it is easy to understand - in simple money terms at least - why ministers have adopted such an approach. About 40 of the budget is spent on pay and with the NHS facing a??30bn hole in its finances by 2020, the government is under pressure to make resources stretch as far as they can. That said, ministers know they face a tricky dilemma. Governments tend to avoid getting into disputes with health workers - public opinion normally sides with them - and so a lengthy period of industrial action ahead of an election will be something ministers will be keen to avoid.

{"original_text": "She's just been in the studio with Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw, trying to make him giggle while he goes about some serious radio presenting business; and she's daydreaming about her favourite UK delicacy - a sandwich from Pret. When she discovers she's in the same building as the BBC newsroom, the star politely asks for a guided tour. \"I never get to do stuff like this,\" marvels the singer, as she walks wide-eyed past the studios and satellite feeds. In this context, Del Rey is oddly anonymous. Jane Hill, who is preparing to read the lunchtime news on BBC One, doesn't even look up when the superstar squeezes past her desk. It's a rare luxury for someone who's followed by paparazzi and the all-seeing cameras of TMZ when she's at home in California. She addresses the lack of privacy on her new album, Lust For Life, where a song called 13 Beaches finds Del Rey searching for a spot \"past Ventura and lenses plenty\" where she can enjoy a romantic moment in seclusion. When we sit down to chat, she reveals those same concerns stopped her attending the women's marches in Los Angeles, earlier this year. \"I drove my sister and her girlfriends to the marches,\" she says. \"I thought about [joining in] but I felt, like, not really sure how it would go. \"I didn't really want to be a distraction to that group of 10 girls who were going. I wanted them to think about the actual march and not about me standing right next to them.\" But the star is making her contribution in other ways. A new song, God Bless America And All The Beautiful Women In It, is an ode to womankind may you stand proud and strong; while Coachella - Woodstock In My Mind, mines the contradictions of dancing at a festival \"whilst watching tensions with North Korea mount.\" It's a new dimension for Del Rey's lyrics - which have traditionally concerned themselves with \"looking for love in all the wrong places.\" \"I kind of got jolted into the real world again,\" she says. \"Just being in California, it's such a liberal state, I was bombarded with the news every day. So my studio became like a think tank - during the elections it was a constant conversation with my producer and engineers and assistant engineers. \"And then obviously during Coachella, that news broke about North Korea and pointing missiles at each other. That was a bit of a rude awakening.\" Del Rey's work rate is astonishing. Lust For Life is her fifth album in six years - and it bursts at the seams, with 16 tracks all co-written with her longtime producer Rick Nowels. They record everything at his studio in Santa Monica, just blocks away from the beach, so it \"never feels like work,\" she says. \"Just walking in every day and having a coffee together and taking a walk, and then we start. \"So it doesn't ever feel like I'm pumping them [the songs] out. Although it's definitely a blessing that I've been able to put out so much music.\" On Lust For Life, the singer has opened up musically, as well as lyrically. The title track is a pulse-raising duet with The Weeknd, while Summer Bummer almost self-destructs, dissolving into digital noise and blacked-out beats, with Lana's vocals barely holding the song together. She's also welcomed collaborators into her world for the first time - absorbing them into her aesthetic, rather than capitalising on chart trends. \"It was really fun!\" she says of working with AAP Rocky and The Weeknd. \"I wanted those guys to add a little fire, a little energy to the record.\" More daunting was inviting rock legend Stevie Nicks to duet on Beautiful People, Beautiful Problems. \"I was definitely nervous,\" says Del Rey of the recording session. \"She got off the plane at 10:30, so she didn't get to the studio until midnight - and she just breezed in, black on black, gold everywhere. She was kind of a vision. \"When she started singing, she told me she wanted to hear me sing something, too. And then I really freaked out! \"I said to her over the mic,'I just sound so quiet compared to you.' And she was like,'That's ok, you can be my little echo!' \"I thought that was so cool. I'm not as loud as her. My voice isn't as low as hers. But she loves it for what it is. \"That, as it was happening, was a career-defining moment for me.\" Other songs on the album had a more troubled gestation. Del Rey says the closing track, Get Free, originally had a different title, and much more personal lyrics. \"That song started out really revealing,\" she says. \"I wanted to summarise my whole experience over the last six years; and then I realised, I don't want to reveal everything.\" Once the initial version was \"out of my system,\" she says, the recording was \"deleted completely then started from scratch.\" The lyrics became more vague and more hopeful; and the re-recorded version ends with Del Rey referencing Neil Young: \"I want to move out of the black, into the blue.\" \"I think it would have been hard for me to do interviews if I'd said a couple of particular things that I was thinking of,\" she says of the original. \"Kind of the way Ultraviolence did. It was harder to promote that record.\" She's referring to the title track of her second album, which depicted Del Rey in a destructive, abusive relationship. Del Rey has previously hinted the song refers to her association with an \"underground sect\" in New York, which was controlled by a charismatic guru. In concert, she has recently stopped singing the song's key line, \"he hit me and it felt like a kiss.\" \"I don't feel comfortable with that lyric any more,\" she says now. \"Whatever my concept of affection was at the time, it does not serve me any more. Obviously. Hopefully.\" On Lust For Life she seems happier, more outward-looking than before. On stage, she's more confident, too. Launching the album at a one-off gig in London, she's forced to abandon her performance of the opening track, Love. Earlier in her career, she might have frozen. Now, she just sings it a capella, with the crowd stepping in as her own personal choir. \"I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I think my keyboard player was playing the wrong chords,\" she explains. \"I was leaning in to him and saying,'That's not it, that's not it' and he was like,'That is it, trust me'. \"I listened for 10 seconds and I was like,'Damn, I definitely can't get it'. I couldn't get it in rehearsal, either. So I just told him to stop. I feel bad - I was kind of abrasive. \"But that song is at the heart of the record and I thought it'd be weird if I didn't do it. So, luckily the people who were at the show knew the words and they sang along with me.\" She listens with glee to a recording of the song - explaining how, because she wears in-ear headphones, she hadn't realised how loud the crowd had been. \"I'm so glad,\" she says. \"Being in the audience, did you feel that, too?\" I tell her it was like being in church. \"Oh, stop!\" she beams, and bursts into laughter.

{"original_text": "India's greatest leader had moved to a village called Segaon two years earlier. He had renamed it Sevagram or a village of service. He built an ashram, a commune which was home to \"many a fateful decision which affected the destiny of India.\" Gandhi had moved in with his wife, Kasturba, and some followers. There was also a steady stream of guests. Kanu Gandhi, a callow young man in his 20s and a grand nephew of the Mahatma, was also there. Armed with a Rolleiflex camera, he was taking pictures of the leader. He had wanted to become a doctor, but his parents had goaded him to join Gandhi's personal staff doing clerical work, looking after accounts and writing letters at the ashram. Kanu Gandhi had developed an interest in photography, but Gandhi had told him there was no money to buy him a camera. The nephew did not relent. Finally, Gandhi asked businessman Ghanshyam Das Birla to gift 100 rupees (1.49; PS1.00) to Kanu so that he could buy the camera and a roll of film. But the leader imposed three conditions on the photographer: he forbade him from using flash and asking him to pose; and made it clear that the ashram would not pay for his photography. Kanu made do with a stipend from a Gandhi acolyte who liked his work. He also began selling his pictures to newspapers. Over the years and until Gandhi's assassination in 1948, Kanu Gandhi shot some 2,000 pictures of the greatest leader of the Indian Independence movement. For decades, his pictures remained in obscurity, once surfacing with a German researcher who began compiling and selling them. Now, 92 of those rare pictures of Gandhi during the last decade of his life have been published in an exquisitely produced cloth-bound monograph by the Delhi-based Nazar Foundation, a non-profit trust founded by two of India's most well-known photographers Prashant Panjiar and Dinesh Khanna. This is possibly my most favourite image from the book. Here Gandhi is standing on a weighing scale at the Birla House in Bombay (what is now Mumbai) in 1945. For a man who undertook more than a dozen fasts during the freedom movement as a part of his non-violent protests - to bring peace, demand Muslim rights or to shame rioting mobs - the picture is telling. \"This is a picture of a man keeping an eye on his weight, testing himself all the time. It tells you a lot about the man,\" says leading photographer Sanjeev Saith who went through more than 1,000 images and helped curate the monograph. Here, Gandhi is seen in front of his office hut at Sevagram ashram in 1940. A pillow covers his head as protection against the severe heat. It is, at once, an intimate and remote image. Which is one of the reasons, many say, that made Kanu Gandhi's pictures of the Mahatma so special. \"Although he had incredible access to the icon, we are always struck at the way Kanu, perhaps because he was in awe of Gandhi always kept a respectful distance, and yet managed to convey a sense of intimacy and proximity,\" says Panjiar. \"And because he kept a certain distance, Kanu intuitively found a more modern language of photography than what was prevalent in those times in India, framing many of his images with an interesting and unconventional use of the foreground, breaking many of the accepted rules of composition.\" Kanu Gandhi travelled far and wide with the leader. Here's his image of a van carrying Gandhi being pushed by Pathans and Congress workers over some rough terrain in the North West Frontier Provinces in October 1938. This is a picture of Gandhi, and his wife Kasturba, in Abottabad in November, 1938. Kanu Gandhi's first-ever book of photographs chronicles the leader's political and personal journey in his last decade in vivid detail. There are pictures of Gandhi in his many moods - brooding, joyous, pensive, grieving - and with his supporters. Here Gandhi is being massaged by a relative and his elder sister Raliatbehn during a three-day fast in Gujarat's Rajkot city in March 1939. \"These images may be old, but they are not old-fashioned. They are not straightforward, beautifully shot and carefully framed, neat pictures which were popular then,\" says Panjiar. \"It possibly helped that Kanu was not a trained photographer because many of his images would have been rejected by his contemporaries on account of being blurred, slightly out of focus or double exposed. But these find pride of place, lovingly pasted by own hands in albums.\" Gandhi and his wife Kasturba are seen here at a wedding of a Christian man and an untouchable woman in Sevagram ashram, 1940. Sanjeev Saith says the picture of a dying Kasturba Gandhi lying on a bed at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune in 1944 a few months before her death counts among his favourites. A broken shaft of light is streaming in through a window behind her. \"Here is this austere woman lying regally on this stately bed, she is about to die. This picture just shakes me up,\" he says. And then there is this historic 1938 picture of Gandhi in a convivial mood with freedom hero and radical nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose. In the background, Kasturba Gandhi is drawing her sari, and looking into the distance. This was the high noon of Bose's political life: he had been elected as president of the Congress party. Gandhi had overruled objections from independence hero Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who had objected to Bose's appointment. The two leaders had shared a complex relationship and fell out later over differences. \"This is an amazing picture,\" says Saith. \"It contains two of India's greatest heroes in one frame. Bose is young, cherubic, almost looking at Gandhi in admiration. Gandhi has his characteristic toothless grin. It is a nice, warm moment.\" Here's Gandhi and Nobel Prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore in Shantiniketan, West Bengal, in February 1940, a study of two great men in meditation. \"Look at the bottom of the picture. It is an accidental double exposure [a technique which combined two different images into a single image]. It's rather inventive. Kanu Gandhi knew it was a good picture, and he didn't throw away the negative,\" says Saith. There's a series of pictures of Gandhi collecting donations for a fund for the untouchables during a three-month long train journey that took him to Bengal, Assam and southern India in 1945-46. In some he's stretching his arm from a carriage for money; in others he's surrounded by people and collecting the money in a slender basket. \"He's an old man, but he looks agile. He's almost begging for alms, and he's serious about picking up every bit of money for a good cause. He understands money,\" says Saith. \"I am a bania and there is no limit to my greed,\" Gandhi once said, alluding to his Indian caste comprising mainly of moneylenders. Being the only person who was allowed to take Gandhi's photographs at any time, Kanu Gandhi was shooting every day. Sometimes Gandhi intervened: one such moment was when Kasturba, lay dying in his lap at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. The nephew, however, was allowed to shoot this image of the leader, draped in a shawl, looking at Kasturba after she passed away in February 1944. According to several accounts, Gandhi kept a vigil for hours, sitting by her side, praying. \"After sixty years of constant companionship,\" he said later that night. \"I cannot imagine life without her.\" Ironically, for a man who followed Gandhi like a shadow, Kanu Gandhi was away in Noakhali in east Bengal when his leader was killed in 1948. \"Gandhi's death had a profound effect on Kanu and his wife, Abha's life. For Kanu, photography was no longer as important as the need to convey his leader's message,\" says Panjiar. Kanu Gandhi died after a heart attack while on a pilgrimage in northern India in February 1986. Photographs by Kanu Gandhi Gita Mehta, heir of Abha and Kanu Gandhi.", "text_perturb": "India 's greatest leader had moved to a settlement called Segaon two years earlier. He had rename it Sevagram or a village of service. He built an ashram , a commune which be home to `` many a fateful decision which affected the destiny of India. `` Gandhi had go in with his wife , Kasturba , and some followers. There was also a unwavering stream of guests. Kanu Gandhi , a unfledged young man in his 20s and a grand nephew of the Mahatma , was also there. Armed with a Rolleiflex camera , he was taking pictures of the loss leader. He had wanted to become a doctor , but his parent had goaded him to join Gandhi 's personal staff doing clerical work , looking after accounts and writing letters at the ashram. Kanu Gandhi had developed an interest in photography , but Gandhi had told him there was no money to buy him a tv camera. The nephew did non relent. Finally , Gandhi asked businessman Ghanshyam Das Birla to gift 100 nepalese rupee ( 1. 49 ; PS1. 00 ) to Kanu so that he could buy the tv camera and a roll of film. But the leader imposed three conditions on the photographer : he forbade him from using newsbreak and asking him to pose ; and made it clear that the ashram would not pay for his photography. Kanu made fare with a stipend from a Gandhi acolyte who liked his work. He also began selling his pictures to newspaper publisher. Over the years and until mahatma gandhi 's assassination in 1948 , Kanu mahatma gandhi shot some 2,000 pictures of the greatest leader of the Indian Independence movement. For decades , his pictures stay in obscurity , once surfacing with a German researcher who began compiling and selling them. Now , 92 of those rare pictures of Gandhi during the last decennary of his life have been published in an exquisitely produced cloth-bound monograph by the Delhi-based Nazar Foundation , a non-profit trust founded by two of India 's most well-known photographers Prashant Panjiar and Dinesh Khanna. This is perhaps my most favourite image from the book. Here Gandhi is standing on a weighing plate at the Birla House in Bombay ( what is now Mumbai ) in 1945. For a man who undertook more than a dozen fasts during the freedom movement as a part of his non-violent protests - to bring peace , demand Muslim rights or to shame rioting mobs - the image is telling. `` This is a picture of a man hold an eye on his weight , testing himself all the time. It tells you a raft about the man , '' says leading photographer Sanjeev Saith who went through more than 1,000 images and helped curate the monograph. Here , Gandhi is seen in front of his authority hut at Sevagram ashram in 1940. A pillow covers his head as protection against the severe heating system. It is , at once , an confidant and remote image.

Shane Bissett , director of commemorative coin and bullion at the royal stag Mint , said : `` We felt there could be no more fitting design to mark the first birthday of our future king than the royal arms - the arms of the monarch - minted in honour of the future heir to the throne. `` The choice of a silver coin is significant too , as the precious metal is closely assort with newborn babies. . . `` Crossing the palm of a newborn baby with silver is a way to wish them wealth and good wellness throughout their life , whilst the PS5 coin is a favourite for royal celebrations. `` The coins leave be a limited mintage of 7,500 and leave cost PS80 each from the Royal Mint.

{"original_text": "One of the first out of the blocks is a touring production of All My Sons by black-led theatre company Talawa. The story centres on all-American couple Joe and Kate Keller, whose son is missing after World War Two. Its director Michael Buffong tells arts correspondent Tim Masters what makes the play a 20th Century classic. What does it mean to you to be taking All My Sons on the road in Miller's centenary year? The fact that it's a centenary year shines an even brighter spotlight on what is an amazing piece of work and an amazing writer. We originally performed this in 2013 and I'd love to say I planned the tour for the centenary, but the truth of it is that it's a coincidence. What makes All My Sons an American classic? The themes are so universal. On one level it's about chasing the dream and the cost of trying to live it. The themes that come out of the play are issues of loyalty and trust and betrayal, and secrets within families and how people collude and how ultimately everything can come falling down. The themes are so universal - what would you do for your family? Joe Keller thinks anything is forgivable because it's been done for his family but he doesn't have a wider social responsibility. That's his downfall. The 2013 production earned five star reviews - does that add pressure to taking it out two years later? I haven't thought about it. If I did I might not sleep too well. I guess it might add a bit of pressure. I read reviews, you can't help it. One has to be able to take them - the good and the bad. Given that it was such a hit, how much are you tweaking this time round? Like with any fantastic play once you get to revisit it you realise its depth - we are finding so many new things. Half the cast are different so it can't be the same because they bring new elements. It just goes to show the quality of the text: there's always more to unearth. Does having a black cast give the play a new perspective? It certainly gives it a nuance. If you think of a black family trying to achieve the American dream suddenly the stakes become higher still because of black history in the US. But it essentially remains the same story: it's a family drama, and this family is an all-American family. You took over Talawa in 2012 - are there still things you want to achieve? I'm just at the beginning. The past three years have been great and we are starting to achieve some of things we set out to do. It's great that we get do do All My Sons, and we get to work with the companies like the National Theatre as we did last year with Moon on a Rainbow Shawl. We've got a writers' programme working with the Bush and Soho Theatres and the BBC, and we have a space we are desperate to develop into a 100-seat venue. We are looking for funding to do that. What's the latest on workshops you've had with Lenny Henry on a play about the American comedian Richard Pryor? We are still in the workshopping process. It's in development. I hope it will come to the stage. We are both keen to see it happen. All My Sons, with a cast led by Ray Shell and Dona Croll, has opened at Ipswich's New Wolsey Theatre, and tours until 25 April.

{"original_text": "He is the latest casualty of the Trump White House, and takes the record for the shortest term in a top job: he was fired 10 days after being announced as communications director. But of course, there is a long line of people behind him who have been fired or eased out of their jobs by President Trump. Here's a run-down of what they did, and why they left, starting with \"The Mooch.\" The brash, Wall Street big wig has known President Trump for years, and charismatically defended him in TV interviews. Although he didn't last long in the job, he made big headlines. He appeared to accuse Chief of Staff Reince Priebus of being responsible for White House leaks in a tweet (later deleted) that also appeared to threaten him. Mr Scaramucci then attacked Mr Priebus and President Trump's senior adviser Steve Bannon in an expletive-filled rant on the phone with a reporter from the New Yorker magazine. Why was he sacked? Although he had boasted of reporting directly to the president, Mr Scaramucci's ill-discipline may have cost him any post alongside President Trump's new chief of staff - retired, four-star General John Kelly. Mr Scaramucci's departure was announced hours after Mr Kelly was sworn-in to replace Mr Priebus. The White House said Mr Trump believed comments Mr Scaramucci had made were \"inappropriate.\" Time in post? Ten days. (Though his official start date was 15 August - so possibly minus-15 days.) The former Republican National Committee chairman was one of few Washington veterans given a top role in the Trump White House but was unable to assert his authority. He grappled with competing powers in an administration where Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, play key roles. Mr Scaramucci was hired despite Mr Priebus's disagreement and insulted him seemingly without reproach from the president. Why was he sacked? President Trump lost confidence in him and clearly wanted a shake-up in the White House, opting for a general to replace the Republican Party operative, who was seen as weak. The announcement also came as the Republicans failed in their efforts to repeal Obamacare in the Senate. Time in post? Six months. Mr Spicer famously kicked off his tenure as White House press secretary by defending a seemingly indefensible claim about the crowd size at President Trump's inauguration. Over the course of his time behind the podium, he became - unusually for a press secretary - a household name, and was parodied on Saturday Night Live. Why did he leave? Unlike most others on this list, Mr Spicer appears to have left on seemingly good terms with the president. He stepped down after Mr Scaramucci was appointed to a role he had partially filled, saying he did not want there to be \"too many cooks in the kitchen.\" Sarah Huckabee Sanders had also taken over many of Mr Spicer's press briefings. The New York Times reported that Mr Spicer had \"vehemently\" disagreed with the appointment of Mr Scaramucci, which he believed to be a \"major mistake.\" Time in post? Six months. Mr Comey played a dramatic and controversial part in the closing stages of the election when he announced, a week before the vote, that the FBI had reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. He was criticised first by Democrats for the timing and alleged indiscretion of the announcement, then by Republicans when he said a week later that no charges would be brought. But Mr Trump praised the FBI director heavily, saying it \"took a lot of guts\" to make his announcement and that he had \"brought back his reputation.\" He blew Mr Comey a kiss at the White House. The president grew less appreciative of him as the FBI director led an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Why was he sacked? The Trump administration first claimed Mr Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation rendered him no longer able to credibly lead the bureau and that Mr Trump had acted on the deputy attorney general's recommendation. However Mr Trump soon contradicted this, calling him a \"showboat\" in a TV interview and saying he was thinking if the \"Russia thing\" when he made the decision to sack him. Later it emerged that he allegedly told Russian officials that the dismissal had taken \"great pressure\" off him. Special counsel Robert Mueller is reported to be investigating whether obstruction of justice occurred. Time in post? Three years, eight months. Less than four months under Mr Trump. Technically, Michael Flynn resigned, but he was asked to do so by the president. His departure followed weeks of deepening scandal in which it emerged that he had misled White House officials, including the vice-president, over his contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Mr Flynn is said to have discussed US sanctions against Russia with Mr Kislyak before Mr Trump took office. Mr Trump was briefed on the possibility that Mr Flynn was open to blackmail, because Moscow knew he was lying, but 18 days elapsed before the president sacked him, raising questions about exactly what the president knew and when. Why was he sacked? It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy, and once it was established that Mr Flynn had lied about his contact with Mr Kislyak there was no question that he had to go. The question with this sacking was, why did it take so long? White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the president needed the time to investigate Mr Flynn and establish his guilt, but the scandal prompted fierce speculation over what the president knew of Mr Flynn's contacts with Mr Kislyak. Time in post? 23 days. The president fired Sally Yates after she questioned the legality of Mr Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Ms Yates, who was appointed by Barack Obama, believed it discriminated unconstitutionally against Muslims, and ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce the president's executive order. Within hours, she was fired. Why was she sacked? A White House statement said Ms Yates had \"betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States.\" It also described her as \"weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.\" But it was also Ms Yates who informed White House counsel that Michael Flynn had misled the vice-president about his contacts with Ambassador Kislyak and presented a risk of Russian blackmail as a result. The president's sacking of an Obama-era holdover who had openly defied him was certainly less controversial than the Comey dismissal, but it drew heavy criticism from Democrats, who said Ms Yates had done her job in standing up to the travel ban. Time in post? 10 days. It is not uncommon for prosecutors appointed by the previous administration to be replaced as the White House changes hands, but the widely-respected Preet Bharara had been told specifically by the Trump administration that he would be kept on. Mr Bharara had built a reputation as the \"Sheriff of Wall Street\" after a number of aggressive prosecutions of traders. At the time of his sacking, he was overseeing several high-profile cases, including an investigation into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's campaign finances and allegations of sexual harassment at Trump favourite Fox News. Why was he sacked? Mr Bharara was one of 46 prosecutors asked to resign by the Trump administration, which contended that it was part of a simple changing of the guard. But there was speculation among Democrats and others that Mr Bahara's jurisdiction, which included Trump Tower, may have concerned the president. A few days before he was sacked, three ethics groups called on Mr Bharara in an open letter to investigate whether Trump companies in his jurisdiction had received foreign payments. Meanwhile, a ProPublica investigation revealed that Mr Bharara was overseeing an investigation into stock trades by Mr Trump's incoming health secretary Tom Price. Three Democratic senators wrote to attorney general Jeff Sessions asking him to investigate the Bharara sacking. Time in post? Seven years, seven months. Less than two under Mr Trump. Paul Manafort, a long-time Republican political operative, was supposed to marshal some of the chaos around Mr Trump but ended up falling prey to it. He was sacked after five months with Mr Trump's campaign, three of those as campaign chair. Why was he sacked? The Trump campaign didn't give a reason for Mr Manafort's departure, issuing only a boilerplate statement wishing him well. But a wave of reports in the week before the announcement alleged that Mr Manafort had received secret cash payments from a pro-Russian political party for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and the US. While Mr Manafort was running the campaign, the Republican Party changed the language in its manifesto regarding the conflict in Ukraine, removing anti-Russian sentiment, allegedly at the behest of two Trump campaign representatives.

{"original_text": "Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly revenue of 80,000 (PS62,000). The firearms trade has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks. The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access, in order for users to remain anonymous. While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations, it had the potential to become the platform of choice for \"lone-wolf\" terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition, the report said. Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation Europe, working with Manchester University, found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition, explosives, or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets. Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting, which left nine people dead, used weapons purchased on the dark net. Lead author of the research, Giacomo Persi Paoli, said: \"Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real. \"The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists, who can make virtually anonymous purchases, but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect.\" Guns account for less than 1 of items sold on the platform, with its main trade being in narcotics.

The study involved collecting data from 12 dark net marketplaces during a week in September 2016. Most of those selling guns were based in the US, but Europe was the most popular destination for the weapons they sold. Judith Aldridge, co-investigator on the study, said: \"In very simple terms, anyone can connect to the dark web and within minutes have access to a variety of vendors offering their products, which are most often illegal. \"The dark web enables illegal trade at a global level, removing some of the geographical barriers between vendors and buyers, while increasing the personal safety of both buyers and sellers through a series of anonymising features that obscure their identities.\"", "text_perturb": "Those selling the illicit arm often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers , the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly gross of 80,000 ( PS62,000 ). The firearms barter has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks. The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access , in order for user to remain anonymous. While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations , it had the potential to suit the platform of choice for `` lone-wolf '' terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition , the report said. Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation eec , working with Manchester University , found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition , explosives , or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets. Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting , which left nine people all in , used weapons purchased on the dark net. Lead author of the inquiry , Giacomo Persi Paoli , said : `` Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real. `` The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists , who can make virtually anonymous purchase , but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect. `` Guns account for less than 1 of items sold on the chopine , with its main trade being in narcotics. Nevertheless , the volume being trade `` can be considered sufficiently high to be a cause of concern for policy makers and law enforcement agencies , '' said the report.

This was a hugely significant fixture for the visitors too, Louis van Gaal and his players arriving with their fate in their own hands but little margin for error. They knew victory here, amid a heady mix of nostalgia and fierce hostility, would leave them needing only to beat Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Sunday to secure Champions League football. Instead, a 3-2 loss leaves them still needing that win against the Cherries - but now requiring that neighbours Manchester City lose at Swansea. Media playback is not supported on this device As a fleet of London taxis brought a succession of West Ham greats on to the Boleyn Ground turf for the big finish to the farewell party, several cynics suggested one cab was on order to ferry Van Gaal away from Manchester United. It has been obvious since Christmas that there has been no great appetite inside Old Trafford to replace Van Gaal - if United were certain he was not the man for the job, former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho could have already been occupying his office or at least officially lined up. Even in the hours before this loss at West Ham, Van Gaal's position appeared to be gaining strength with the supposed loss of 18-year-old transfer target Renato Sanches to Bayern Munich in a PS27.6m deal. It was later suggested United had not missed out but that Van Gaal had actually vetoed the deal - and why would the club let him do that if he was not going to be in charge next season? The fact that Sanches' agent is Jorge Mendes, who would love to see his client Mourinho installed at Old Trafford, only added to the perceived political intrigue. Media playback is not supported on this device One way Van Gaal could have strengthened his position even further would have been a win at West Ham that would have made United firm favourites to beat City to fourth place in the Premier League, with the potential bonus of an FA Cup final victory over Crystal Palace in May. Indeed, so buoyed was Van Gaal by the sudden upturn in his position that he was even able to point out to the media that they were finally posing tactical questions before a game rather than asking about his possible sacking. And for four tantalising second-half minutes it all seemed on for Van Gaal. Antony Martial's brilliance had turned the game, undeservedly on its balance, in United's favour with two goals. At 2-1 up, they were 14 minutes from a win that could have offered the opportunity to put a different spin on their season. It was not to be. Old vulnerabilities quickly returned and saw United beaten by two headed goals from Michail Antonio and Winston Reid - leaving Van Gaal back on the rack. The players dragged their manager out of a hole then threw him back in again. The intention may still be to keep him next season but that decision would have been made a lot easier and more palatable with victory. Now it all goes on the line again on Sunday - but with Manchester City at the controls. The equation is simple. Manchester United must beat Bournemouth and hope Manchester City lose at Swansea - and therein lies that sliver of hope for the 64-year-old Dutch coach. City have been so unreliable, unpredictable and uninspired at times this season that you would not risk too much on the certainty of Manuel Pellegrini's side getting the job done. Of course City will be favourites and only need a point - but they are not a team to be trusted, as seen in their heavy defeat at Southampton and disappointing draw at home to Arsenal in their last two Premier League games. And after beating Liverpool 3-1 and, more impressively, thrashing West Ham 4-1 at Upton Park on Saturday, Swansea are also running into the sort of relaxed good form that makes them dangerous opponents. Confidence has been renewed to such an extent that head coach Francesco Guidolin is expected to be confirmed on a new contract after a Swansea board meeting on Wednesday. City can be fragile and United will hope that vulnerability haunts them one last time. And then all it needs is for United to beat Bournemouth - but United cannot be trusted either. Manchester United's players may have been affected by an arduous coach journey that ended in such disgraceful scenes outside Upton Park - and West Ham co-owner David Sullivan's dismissive response that the visitors should simply have arrived earlier did no credit to him or his club on this landmark night. The kick-off was delayed by 45 minutes but there was still no excuse for a tepid Manchester United first half that lacked urgency, organisation and anything that would be reasonably expected with stakes so high. They were lucky to only trail to Diafra Sakho's early goal, their defence going missing in its entirety shortly afterwards when Andy Carroll raced clear only to shoot straight at David de Gea. It was as if Van Gaal had not impressed upon his players that a door to the Champions League that had looked shut for so long was suddenly ajar. Instead it looked like meaningless, end-of-season stuff. The superb Martial offered brief hope, the normally passive Van Gaal leaping from his seat to punch the air - but the joy did not last long as the visitors' vulnerability in defence was exposed. They simply could not cope with West Ham's pressure. For long spells this was a performance that made you question how such an ordinary side could even be in contention for a top-four place. They were that poor. True, they missed the aerial strength of suspended Marouane Fellaini, who operated with such success to not only combat the likes of Carroll but also score when Manchester United won 2-1 at Upton Park in the FA Cup quarter-final replay. In the final reckoning, however, this defeat was deserved after a display that produced much of the evidence that has left so many United fans questioning Van Gaal's future. Van Gaal will still believe his side can reach the Champions League but the odds are against them now so he may well end up looking to the FA Cup for success. If United win he will undoubtedly paint this as progress - and he will have a point as it would be the club's first major trophy since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. It may not be enough, however, to suggest Van Gaal is pointing United in the right direction, despite his willingness to play youth with the emergence of 18-year-old Marcus Rashford and the signing of 20-year-old Antony Martial - who increasingly looks like a bargain at PS36m from Monaco.

{"original_text": "England's win over South Africa on Sunday secured the Twenty20 series. The game was officially sold out, as were England's two ICC Champions Trophy matches at the SSE Swalec Stadium. The near-15,000 crowd comes as counties bid for the next round of five years' worth of international games. \"To have three full houses over 19 days for England matches is something we've very proud of,\" said Morris. Cardiff hosted England's win over New Zealand and semi-final defeat to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy, along with Sri Lanka versus Pakistan and the less well-attended Bangladesh v New Zealand match. Around 3,000 seats were not occupied for the England v New Zealand match because of poor weather forecasts, while cancelled trains are believed to have contributed to some empty seats for the T20 on Sunday.

{"original_text": "Sir Alex Ferguson's Premier League champions responded in spectacular fashion to Manchester City's outstanding 5-1 win at Spurs by returning to the top of the table with a result that represented Arsenal's worst defeat since 1896. Wenger sent out a makeshift side depleted by injuries and suspensions - but even this cannot excuse the manner in which they were outclassed in all parts of the pitch and swept aside with such ease by United. Wayne Rooney was United's inspiration with the sixth hat-trick of his Old Trafford career, but Ashley Young also made his mark with two stunning goals. Danny Welbeck, Nani and Park Ji-sung were the other scorers. Media playback is not supported on this device Theo Walcott reduced United's three-goal advantage on the stroke of half-time but Robin van Persie's strike late in the second half-represented no measure of consolation for a dispirited, broken Arsenal. United keeper David de Gea distinguished himself with a fine penalty save from Van Persie moments after Welbeck had opened the scoring - and in a game of almost unrelenting misery for Arsenal, teenager Carl Jenkinson ensured they have failed to end a game with 11 players in any of their league games this season when he was sent off. Old Trafford was understandably exultant at the conclusion of such a carnival performance but Wenger now faces defining days of his Arsenal reign before the transfer window closes on Wednesday. For Wenger it was a performance, or lack of one, that proved the folly of his summer of transfer inaction Read more of the blog This result underscores the gulf that has opened up between United and Arsenal and Wenger will now seek to address the weaknesses in his squad and replace the departed Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri. Ferguson's faith in the team that won so convincingly against Tottenham was rewarded with another thrilling attack-minded performance. Arsenal's uncertainty was partly explained by the unfamiliar make-up of their team, but the flaws were swiftly exposed by the manner in which United took the lead. Anderson's lofted pass was inventive but Arsenal's failure to react was ominous for what lay ahead, allowing Welbeck to head past Wojciech Szczesny. Van Persie then squandered an instant opportunity to equalise after referee Howard Webb awarded a penalty when Walcott tangled with Jonny Evans in the area. De Gea has had a mixed start to his Old Trafford career but he was engulfed by his team-mates as he dived to his right to make a fine save. And United ensured Arsenal were punished heavily as Young added the second after 28 minutes. Young found space just outside the area and curled a perfect finish high beyond Szczesny's grasp at the Stretford End. Welbeck's game was cut short by a hamstring injury - but there was no respite for Arsenal as Rooney worked a free-kick routine with Young to send a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner as the interval approached. Walcott halted some of United's momentum when he took advantage of slack marking to shoot beneath De Gea in first-half injury time. It made little difference amid the carnage of the second half as Arsenal were torn apart amid a torrent of goals, near misses and saves from the desperately exposed Szczesny. Arsenal survived until the 64th minute when they were undone by another piece of Rooney creation at a set-piece, again linking with Young before dispatching the finish past the motionless Arsenal keeper. It was the breaking point for Arsenal and they spent the remainder of game in a constant state of siege. Rooney was the creator for Nani with the pass that gave the Portuguese the opportunity to send a flamboyant chipped finish over Szczesny for United's fifth. Media playback is not supported on this device With the Gunners in disarray, Park marked his arrival as substitute by lashing home an unstoppable finish before Van Persie briefly interrupted the one-way flow towards Arsenal's goal by beating De Gea. It barely seemed possible for matters to get worse for Arsenal, but the agony increased when Jenkinson was sent off after receiving his second yellow card for fouling Javier Hernandez as he raced clear. Rooney completed his thrilling treble with a penalty eight minutes from time after Walcott fouled Patrice Evra. And United completed the scoring with their eighth in injury time, Young once again showing his eye for the spectacular with another curling shot. Wenger cut a despairing figure as he walked back to the dressing room at the final whistle after one of the darkest days of his career. Full Time The referee blows for the end of the match.

Wenger transmit out a makeshift side depleted by injuries and suspensions - but even this can not excuse the manner in which they were outclassed in all parts of the pitch and swept aside with such ease by United. Wayne Rooney was United 's inspiration with the sixth hat-trick of his Old Trafford career , but Ashley youth also made his mark with two stunning goals. Danny Welbeck , Nani and park Ji-sung were the other scorers. Media playback is not supported on this device Theo Walcott cut down United 's three-goal advantage on the stroke of half-time but Robin van Persie 's strike late in the second half-represented no measure of consolation for a dispirited , broken Arsenal. United keeper David de Gea distinguished himself with a fine penalty save from Van Persie moments after Welbeck had opened the scoring - and in a game of almost unrelenting misery for Arsenal , teenager Carl Jenkinson ensured they have failed to end a game with 11 players in any of their league games this time of year when he was sent off. old Trafford was understandably exultant at the conclusion of such a carnival performance but Wenger now faces defining days of his Arsenal reign before the transfer window closes on Wednesday.

De Gea has had a mixed start to his Old Trafford career but he was engulfed by his team-mates as he dived to his right to arrive at a fine save. And United ensured Arsenal were punished heavily as brigham young added the second after 28 minutes. Young rule space just outside the area and curled a perfect finish high beyond Szczesny 's grasp at the Stretford End. Welbeck 's game represent cut short by a hamstring injury - but there represent no respite for Arsenal as Rooney worked a free-kick routine with Young to send a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner as the interval approached. Walcott kibosh some of United 's momentum when he took advantage of slack marking to shoot beneath De Gea in first-half injury time. It made little difference amid the carnage of the second half as Arsenal make up torn apart amid a torrent of goals , near misses and saves from the desperately exposed Szczesny. Arsenal survived until the 64th minute when they were undone by another piece of Rooney creation at a set-piece , over again linking with Young before dispatching the finish past the motionless Arsenal keeper. It was the breaking point for Arsenal and they spent the remainder of game in a unvarying state of siege.

Rooney completed his thrilling treble with a penalty eight instant from time after Walcott fouled Patrice Evra.

{"original_text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi scrapped 1,000 (PS11.8) and 500 notes in a surprise move last week as part of a tax evasion and corruption crackdown. People have a limited time to exchange the notes for smaller denominations, but will have their fingers marked. The government wants to stop holders of \"black cash\" offloading their old rupee notes in small tranches. Authorities often use indelible ink to stop people from voting more than once in Indian elections. People were told they should deposit their high denomination notes in the banks, or could only exchange up to 4,500 rupees, (65; PS52) for smaller notes. But to clamp down on holders of unlawfully held or untaxed cash, depositors can only make such transactions once and so the banks are using the ink to prevent them from making multiple deposits. India scraps 1,000 rupee notes overnight Chaos at banks over India money ban Supporters say it is a handy way for the Indian government to tackle corruption. The finance ministry suspects \"unscrupulous\" people have been trying to get around the crackdown by sending proxies to exchange their banned rupee notes. The withdrawal of the big notes is aimed at'black money' and targets people who have been dodging taxes by holding stockpiles of cash. While the authorities say people will not be allowed another cash swap, critics are wondering what happens if the ink wears off? During elections, people have used chemicals to remove the ink from their fingers so that they can vote more than once. The government's ban on big bank notes first received widespread approval because less than 3 of Indians file tax returns.

Speaking in the European Parliament, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the plan was a \"handbrake turn\" by David Cameron. The prime minister has hailed a plan to allow the UK to limit the amount of tax credits paid to new EU migrants for up to four years as one of the key elements of a draft package of reforms to the UK's membership of the EU - the details of which he will set out to the UK Parliament later. He has said the emergency brake, which would take effect if it could be proven that high levels of migration were putting an extreme strain on the UK's benefits system, could be triggered almost immediately. But many Tory MPs have criticised the plan, saying it is a watered-down version of the total four-year ban the PM was hoping for and that new migrants would still receive \"graduated\" rates of in-work benefits over the four year period and the full amount after that. They are also unhappy that the brake would have to be approved by other EU nations and the UK could not apply it unilaterally.

It will apply in exceptional cases as all derogrations from the freedoms (of movement rules) should.\" Mr Juncker pointed out that the then Labour government had had the option to introduce transitional controls on migration when countries such as Poland and Hungary entered the EU in 2004 but, unlike Germany, decided against doing so. One of the most controversial decisions of Tony Blair's time in office, several former Labour ministers have since said it was a mistake and acknowledged the government hugely underestimated the number of people who would come to the UK.

When we beat Belgium in Cardiff in June, Coleman kept Hazard quiet by bringing in Jazz Richards at right wing-back and moving Chris Gunter infield to be the right-sided centre-half in our back three. Between them, they handled him really well down Belgium's left, but I don't see Chris doing the same this time because continuity has been a big part of why we have done so well in France, especially at the back where we have been unchanged in all four games. Media playback is not supported on this device I can see Chris sticking with the same team that started against Northern Ireland, but our right-sided defensive midfielder - either Joe Allen or Joe Ledley - will have to get across to help Gunter as soon as Hazard gets the ball, along with James Chester, the right-sided centre-half. Their job will be to stop Hazard from coming inside and to show him down the line instead. When that happens, Gunter will also try to stop the cross from coming in, but you have to be realistic - Hazard is so good, he is going to get some balls over. So all our midfield players will have to pick their runners up around the box, not just De Bruyne, and the most important thing will be to mark Lukaku tightly because he will be trying to get between our other two centre-halves when the cross comes in. Media playback is not supported on this device Saunders: When we clear those crosses, we have got to counter-attack like I know we can do, because while Hazard's attacking play is one of Belgium's strengths, it is also a weakness. Jan Vertonghen's injury means we do not know who will play as Belgium's left-back against Wales but, whoever it is, we will be able to isolate them because Hazard does not run back. Hungary did it effectively, and they do not have the same attacking threat as us. The mistake they made was leaving their wide players too far up the pitch and that allowed Hazard to hurt them more - he was on fire in that game and Belgium should have won by more than 4-0. After watching that game again on Wednesday, though, I now have a clearer picture of what Wales will have to do to win. There is no way we will be as open as Hungary were from the start because we have so many unselfish and disciplined players like Allen and Ledley who do a lot of running just to support our defenders and ensure we do not lose our shape. But, when we steal the ball back, we have to use it properly. That starts with the first header clear from one of those Hazard crosses. I would be telling Gareth Bale or Aaron Ramsey to drift over to Belgium's left where they will have space - and the aim should be to get the ball to them and build the attack from there. Media playback is not supported on this device Hartson: There is a decision to be made up front because Hal Robson-Kanu played in both games against Belgium in the qualifiers and did not let us down. Hal is very mobile and gives us a threat in behind their defence with his pace, and he can also carry the ball better than Sam Vokes can. Sam is a big centre-forward that you can hit the ball to, and he will keep hold of it. He has a similar role to the one I had up front for Wales - winning headers and winning fouls so the team can advance up the pitch. It depends which way Chris wants to go, but Sam has started the past two games and I don't think he has done an awful lot wrong. He will contain both of Belgium's centre-halves like he did against Russia and give them problems in the air and on the ground - you cannot get around him. Media playback is not supported on this device Sam missed a good chance against Northern Ireland but the next one he gets like that, he will put it away. I have worked with him and I know how good he is. I also think he will now be feeling like the Wales number nine, not a bit-part player, which is something else I can relate to. At first I was always behind Ian Rush, Mark Hughes and Dean Saunders, but when Hughes became manager he made me first choice and my confidence went through the roof. I took on the mantle of being the main striker and I think Sam is in that position now, as an important member of this team. Media playback is not supported on this device Hartson: Coleman has got pretty much every tactical and selection issue right at this tournament so far but we have to appreciate how good this Belgium team is and what an incredible victory this would be. For it to happen, we need to have total focus at the back and we will rely on our best two players again - Ramsey and Bale, who have been involved in every Wales goal at this tournament - if we are going to score. I am optimistic we can get through, but I would not say I was overly confident about it because watching Belgium the other night was frightening, even if it was only against Hungary. One big factor in our favour is that we are unbeaten in our past three meetings, including a win - so we do know how to get a result against them. Saunders: Belgium are favourites for a reason but we have a good record against them, even going back to when I was in the team. Wales have a winning formula and Bale is part of that.

{"original_text": "The review into 22 abuse cases in Northern Ireland criticised the authorities for not doing enough. The young people went missing a number of times over a 20-month period while being looked after in the care system. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it has recently made policy changes aimed at keeping children safe. In September 2013, the PSNI said it had begun a major investigation into the sexual exploitation of children and young people who had gone missing from care in Northern Ireland. Officers said they had identified 22 people, aged between 13 and 18, who may have been sexually exploited. The PSNI investigation was known was Operation Owl. Thursday's report, examining the PSNI response, has been published by the Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland. It said PSNI officers were effective in locating the teenagers and returning them to the care system. However, it found that they failed to properly examine the extent of the child sexual exploitation taking place and their attempts to find and stop the abusers was - in the words of the review - \"limited and inconsistent.\" While there is praise for the help offered by some staff from residential care homes, Stormont's Health Minister Simon Hamilton said that the report shows not enough support was given to protect the teenagers from harm or the risk of harm. He said the review had identified \"a significant gap\" in knowledge about perpetrators of child sexual exploitation. The head of the PSNI's Public Protection Branch, Det Ch Supt George Clarke said that following Operation Owl, the PSNI has \"implemented a number of changes in our approach to handling this issue to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep children and young people safe.\" \"Indeed, in April of this year, the PSNI formed the Public Protection Branch which is now responsible for policy and practice in relation to a number of areas including child sexual exploitation. \"The new structures enable us to work closely with our partner agencies in a much more cohesive way than before to ensure better protection and safeguarding for children and young people.\" The office said the PSNI has also revised its Missing Persons Protocol, a joint policy with the health and social care authorities. \"This protocol is designed to support effective collaborative safeguarding responses by the PSNI and social services in respect of children who run away or go missing from their homes or care placements and builds upon developments in our knowledge and experience,\" Mr Clarke added.

I like how it is seperate from the dinner lounge (because of the vents and smell lol). They have a pre fixed menu that they give you. Noted on the menu in red. Salad (salad dressing was wierd), miso soup, goyza, chicken wings (more like sesame chicken..BOMB!!). fried rice (had to order two plates! The best fried rice, it wasn't sticky and had a ton of flavor!), All you can eat meats we got were bulgogi nad kalbi. The bulgogi was very good had a alot of flavor however the kalbi I have had better. They also have marinated chicken and pork belly. You can also order other things off the menu such as sushi and other appetizers but you get so much out of the pre fixed menu that ordering other things seemed impossible to eat!! The only thing we ordered was the salmon skin roll. The salmon was so crunchy and salty that it tasted like chips! For dessert we got a choice from vanilla or green tea ice cream. The service was great. The server cooked our bbq and she was very generous on giving more portions to the guys LOL. If I lived in Vegas I would def come back here on a monthly basis!

Had to wait a couple of times with empty waters , even feature to flag a different waiter to top us off. The calamari was very good - tender , not oily , and just a light dusting of breading. The repast took forever to arrive , despite being just a salad ( DRENCHED in dressing ) and an entree. The main accession was cold , as was the plate. Clearly the plate had been sitting in queue for some time ( I had a suspicion since the folks who came in after us , a party of four , were served first , and attentively at that ). My mother voiced the complaint to the owner that the entree was cold but he barely seemed to recognize - he seems to be flighty and not that accomodating.

On a frigid November evening, you'd think that'd be wonderful, but it was SO HOT. I literally felt as if I was getting a sunburn, and coats facing the fire were untouchably hot. It was so profoundly uncomfortable, even after we asked them to turn the fireplace down (they wouldn't turn it all the way off). The table for 7 was not meant to hold that many, and once our appetizers and drinks arrived we were forced to hold the bulky menus in our laps because there was no longer anywhere to set them down.

No balsamic or any dressing of any kind. The whole thing was just barely dusted with shredded basil and mostly tasted like a totinos pizza with no sauce. I had a greek side salad with it that came with no dressing on it or with it at all - just some olives, red pepper, and feta on a bed of dry greens. They did have a delicious malbec, so at least the night was not a total waste. The server, however, forgot to bring me the soda I ordered after it was clear I'd had plenty of malbec, and only refilled our party's water glasses once.

As a non-meat eating person ( I just do n't really like meat , sorry ) who also dislike cilantro , my menu options were very limited , but I expected that at a grille ( the restaurant was n't my choice ). I live excited to see a margherita flatbread option , but again live terribly disappointed. Margherita is operose to screw up. self aggrandising slices of fresh mozz. Tomatoes that can take center level - heirloom , roma , sundried , something. basil leaves. Drizzling of a well balsamic. Done. Nope. none of that. Instead I got a grocery-store style thin insolence with a thick base of shredded pizza-mozz , with mealy and yet unripe beefsteak slices and a half-sphere of a tiny fresh mozz ball on top of each slice. No balsamic or any dressing of any sort. The whole thing personify just barely dusted with shredded basil and mostly tasted like a totinos pizza with no sauce. I had a grecian side salad with it that came with no dressing on it or with it at all - just some olives , red pepper , and feta on a bed of dry greens. They did have a delicious malbec , so at least the night was not a full waste. The server , however , forgot to bring me the soda I ordered after it was clear I 'd had plenty of malbec , and only refilled our party 's water glaze once. Between the excessive heat , drinking the wine coloured too quickly to wash down the bland , sticky , greasy food , I was left chewing ice just to keep from passing out. Turn the heat down on the patrons and up on the menu , and I can see that it 'd be a overnice place. ", "label": 1}

Lots of medications are meant to be injected either under the skin into the fatty tissue (subcutaneousSC) or into muscle tissue (intramuscularIM). For example, insulin and some blood thinners are injected SC, while most vaccines are given IM. A lot of medications can be given either intravenously (IV) or IM or SC. The main difference with the SCIM routes is that the drug will be absorbed into the bloodstream more slowly, which may be preferable in certain situations. However, other medications can be disastrous if they leak out of a vein extravasate. These are often highly concentrated, hyperosmolar solutions such as hypertonic saline, calcium chloride, or the IV contrast used for CT scans. The result is often necrosis (death) of the affected tissue, pain, swelling, and compartment syndrome, which can cut off blood supply to the affected extremity and lead to amputations. When it comes to recreational drugs like heroin, the intensity of the \"high\" is relative to how fast the drug gets into the brain. Injecting into a vein, therefore, is going to deliver the drug to the brain in a high concentration within seconds, with the resulting \"rush\" that IV heroin users are chasing. If you miss the vein, the heroin is probably going IM or SC, so it will get into the bloodstream, and the brain, more slowly, with a less intense high.

Many different antibiotics and other medicines are given subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Then there is the other side of the spectrum.

It will cause cellular death and necrosis, which could then cause an inflammatory response from the body and a whole new set of problems. Then what if you inject something that isn't sterile?

Jokes aside, in pharmacology, we have three areas of administration for drugs, via the vein, into a muscle or under the skin. If you inject into other areas say, bone, it would be really painful since the area surrounding bone is the periosteum, a membrane filled with capillaries and nerves. If you inject to a body cavity, it will probably stay there until the body absorbs it over time. This is the principle behind treating Hydrocephalus (water in the brain), where they put a tube from the brain into a cavity called the peritoneum which acts like a bag that encases your guts.','As somebody else has explained there are different types of injections: intramuscular, intravenous, and subcutanous. Intramuscular uses a long tipped needle and injects deep into muscle. This is typically done on your upper arm muscles (kind of where your triceps are) or the top of your leg (above the knee). This is how those epinephrine emergency pens work for people going into severe allergic shock. Large needle shoved into the top of the leg. Subcutanous is injected just beneath the skin or into fatty tissue. Insulin is subcutanous, you typically inject it into the fat on your waistthigh area. I imagine most prescribed medicines given by injection are not IV because of the difficulty of finding a vein and the...tendency of veins to collapsescaretc. As a recovering IV heroine addict I can give some further insight though. There are veins in your palm so it is possible to IV there with practice (and I have), but if you were to miss the shot would just sit in a bubble under your skin for some hours before being absorbed. (been there too) Same for pretty much anywhere else you SQ.

Let 's say you have a caustic antibiotic or substance that comprise harmful to the cells in your body. It will cause cellular death and necrosis , which could then cause an inflammatory response from the body and a whole new set of job. so what if you inject something that is n't sterile ?

If you inject into other areas say , bone , it would be really painful since the area fence bone is the periosteum , a membrane filled with capillaries and nerves. If you inject to a body cavity , it will probably remain there until the body absorbs it over time.

' , 'As somebody else has explained there are unlike types of injections : intramuscular , intravenous , and subcutanous. Intramuscular uses a foresighted tipped needle and injects deep into muscle.

This live how those epinephrine emergency pens work for people going into severe allergic shock. Large needle shoved into the crest of the leg. Subcutanous is injected just beneath the cutis or into fatty tissue. Insulin is subcutanous , you typically interpose it into the fat on your waistthigh area.

For example , If you were to , say start an IV ( intravenous ) , but you miss , and it goes interstitial ( outside of the vein ) , and you inject dextrose ( essentially sugar , used for low blood glucose ) , it 'll have a necrotic effect. it 'll essentially kill the tissue and blacken it. , Some drugs , like Humira are designed to be subcutaneously injected - fine acerate leaf into the leg - fluid is absorbed over a day or so. So , it all depends on the meat injected. If you want to look at some ( NSFL ) tissue necrosis , google `` Injection injury '' to see what the wrong substance can do under your skin.

The Tesla factory cost 42 million to get started. On top of that, there are costs to running the factory paying the people, the light bill, the mortgage and all that costs real money too.

The amount of dopamine some other neuron in a different part of the brain is releasing is totally unrelated. You think of neurons as people, then you could think of neurotransmitters as balls of different colors that the neuron-people throw to each other. Neurons transmit information this way, but the information and the signal that carries it are two different things. Alice might sometimes tell Bob she wants to a movie by giving him a red ball. From this, you might conclude that red balls are a \"go to movie\" signal. But Cedric tells Dan he wants to go to a movie by using a blue ball. And the town's police chief uses red balls to give people speeding tickets. What gives? This is basically what's going on with dopamine. Dopamine is just a way one neuron can signal another. In fact, it can have totally different effects on different cells, because different types of dopamine receptor can be excitatory, inhibitory, or something a bit more complicated.

I had a few years where I experimented a lot, but I haven't touched any \"drug\" in almost 2 years now. I was in a REALLY bad accident and just have no desire to ever try them again. I had fun, but that part of my life is over now.','I'll tell you about my first LSD trip... I used to live in this meth apartment, everyone was strung out. I used to let my dealer use my car all the time, he'd give me bags in return. One night he said he needed to use my car, but he was taking the last girl I dated (we were over at that time) and some other fat chick, and her little sister. He said he was going to vegas to get acid. I was methed to the gills (as I was in those days) and I didn't quite believe him. He says, \"here take this\" and gives me two tabs on paper. I put them away.... and at the last minute I jump in and go, \"if you're taking my car to vegas I'm going with (we lived in socal so it wasn't so far).\" I was pretty sure he wanted to fuck the last girl I dated. Although I wasn't with her I didn't want her fucking my drug dealer, she was to young, I felt kinda protective. so we headed to vegas. on I-15 I took one of the tabs.... didn't feel shit. I opened the sunroof in my car (i was in the passenger seat).... I started to notice the stars moving around in circles, on different planes.... like on a mobile above a baby carriage.... it was weird. he pulls over at a gas station in the middle of nowhere, he tells me \"something's wrong with your car\" at the time i'm thinking, \"bullshit, this guy is so full of shit\" but I didn't realize then that was the acid talking to me. \"your radiator hose is blown. we can go to my friends trailer....\" his friend had a trailer next to this lockheed air force base, top secret.... there was a guard tower and a fence all around it \"trespassers will be shot with military force...\" i've been to that trailer and met his friends there before so I said ok, in my mind, I thought he was making all this shit up so he can fuck my ex. whatever I thought, at this point. so we go down there.... and the trailer is completely abandoned. his friends had left some time ago. but they left their dog there, a big outdoor dog, short hair. but it was still alive running around the property. we went inside, and it's freezing cold. it's the middle of winter, and in the high desert that means super cold. the electricity was still on in the trailer, but there were no heaters, so we sat around the oven and turned it on (electric oven) for heat. it was so miserable I said \"FUCK IT\" and took the second tab. shortly thereafter the first thing I didn't notice is he snuck away my ex into some bedroom, but I didn't care. because the mirrors on the wall were waving, like a gentle breeze was blowing behind them. i was like, \"holy fuck do you see this...\" no of course not, nobody could. I was the only one on acid.. the mirrors were billowing.... the light in the room seemed to softly go from dim to brighter... the two girls I was with, their faces seemed to melt as I talked to them, like they were aging in fast foward. like indiana jones in the last crusade. i talked to my dealer, he looked like evil, a liar, the devil.... I could see his lies. when he talked to me I couldn't help but to chuckle and dismiss him, like don't even talk to me dude. you're filth. you're a liar. someone let the dog in at some point, and we became friends. to me it looked like pills were dropping out of it's ass. I felt so bad for the dog, I told him, 'don't worry, i'll come back for you, i'll never let you stay here' (i never came back). when the sun came up, I went outside. I noticed the trees and their branches looked perfectly symmetrical. it blew my mind. the sunrise was coming up and the world looked like an amazing cartoon, so beautiful, more real than real could ever be. in fact there was a pattern on EVERYTHING. it looks like.... those holograms on magazine covers from the 90's, that weird color changing silvery effect.... but perfectly symmetrical. like snowflake wallpaper laid on top of EVERYTHING, or kinda like a spider web..... so like stucco on a wall or the dots on your ceiling just line up perfectly. then the triple a guy showed up. turns out my radiator hose really did blow. we headed back to town after that... but that's a whole different story.','Check out the [Erowid experience vaults] (URL0), people post their experiences with various drugs, including if they mixed anything with them.', \"Well, if you're interested, take a look at [Erowid] (URL1).

I could see how one would wish it , but mine were too much. I thought that I had bought some Ecstasy , so I use up more meth than I should have.

I had fun , but that part of my life story is over now. ' , ' I 'll tell you about my first lysergic acid diethylamide trip. . . I used to live in this meth apartment , everyone was string out. I used to let my dealer use of goods and services my car all the time , he 'd give me bags in return. One night he said he needed to use my car , but he be taking the last girl I dated ( we were over at that time ) and some other fat chick , and her little sister. He said he follow going to vegas to get acid. I was methed to the gills ( as I was in those days ) and I did n't quite think him. He says , `` hither take this '' and gives me two tabs on paper. I invest them away. . . . and at the last minute I jump in and go , `` if you 're taking my car to vegas I 'm going with ( we lived in socal so it follow n't so far ). `` I be pretty sure he wanted to fuck the last girl I dated. Although I was n't with her I did n't want her fucking my drug trader , she was to young , I felt kinda protective. so we headed to vegas. on I-15 I took one of the tablet. . . . did n't feel denounce. I opened the sunroof in my car ( iodin was in the passenger seat ). . . . I started to notice the stars moving around in circles , on different aeroplane. . . . like on a mobile above a sister carriage. . . . it was unearthly. he pulls over at a gas station in the middle of nowhere , he tells me `` something 's wrong with your machine '' at the time i 'm thinking , `` bullshit , this guy is so full of shit '' but I did n't realize then that was the acid talking to me. `` your radiator hose is blown. we give the axe go to my friends trailer. . . . `` his friend had a dawdler next to this lockheed air force base , top secret. . . . there was a guard tower and a fence all around it `` trespassers will be shot with military force out. . . `` i 've been to that trailer and met his friends there before so I said ok , in my mind , I thought he was making all this rat up so he can fuck my ex. whatever I remember , at this point. so we go down on that point. . . . and the house trailer is completely abandoned. his friends stimulate left some time ago. but they left their dog there , a magnanimous outdoor dog , short hair. but it was still animated running around the property. we went inside , and it 's block cold. it 's the middle of winter , and in the high desert that means top notch cold. the electricity was still on in the trailer , but there personify no heaters , so we sat around the oven and turned it on ( electric oven ) for heat. it was so miserable I said `` FUCK IT '' and took the second tablet. shortly thereafter the first thing I coiffure n't notice is he snuck away my ex into some bedroom , but I coiffure n't care. because the mirrors on the wall were waving , like a gentle breeze follow blowing behind them. i was like , `` holy fuck do you figure this. . . `` no of class not , nobody could. I was the lonesome one on acid. . the mirror were billowing. . . . the light in the elbow room seemed to softly go from dim to brighter. . . the two girl I was with , their faces seemed to melt as I talked to them , like they were aging in fast foward. like indiana jones in the utmost crusade. ace talked to my dealer , he looked like evil , a liar , the devil. . . . I could pick up his lies. when he talked to me I could n't help but to chuckle and dismiss him , like dress n't even talk to me dude. you 're filth. you 're a prevaricator. somebody let the dog in at some point , and we became friends. to me it looked like pills constitute dropping out of it 's ass. I felt so bad for the dog , I told him , 'do n't concern , i 'll come back for you , i 'll never let you stay here ' ( i never came back ). when the sunshine came up , I went outside.

{"original_text": "The incredibly realistic effects you see in a movie are created over a period of many months, working to create something that will work particularly beautifully for one specific camera angle and one specific moment in a film. Once they've made the effect, they can still take hours to render a single frame of it - even using incredibly expensive, high-end computers. In a video game, that same effect has to run from every possible camera angle, with every possible combination of other things going on at the same time. And the game has to render 24 frames of that action every single second - using only the processing power of your 800 home PC.,A shortage of processing power is the problem.', \"We're a long ways off from having the computing power in a consumer-level machine to do photo-realistic graphics. This has to do with the math used and the tradeoff between looking good enough and accuracy. The more accurate you get, the more math it takes (thus more computing power required). The jump in terms of computing power between good enough and accurate is huge. I'm going to get a bit technical here. Phong shading is the technique we use in games. It is essentially a collection of very simple mathematical formulas that give a very rough estimate of the color of something on your screen. In most cases it looks good enough, but the model goes a bit nuts when you go to extremes. For example reflections tend to be far too bright. The flaws get corrected with other mechanisms like shaders and so on. But again these are only approximations on the behavior of light. Over the years we've built better approximations and the expansion of computing power has allowed us to put a lot more stuff in there to make it look really good. We've gotten damn good at faking it, but at the end of the day all of this is built on an approximation of reality. Light isn't actually being simulated using this technique, therefore there will always be something that doesn't look quite right. It takes human intervention and an artist's touch to make it look better. But you don't have an artist sitting over your shoulder making adjustments to every frame in your game. So why are CG effects in movies so damn photo-realistic? Well that's because they actually do simulate light. They don't use the same technique and mathematical models that are used in computer games. They use a technique called ray tracing which is a physics simulation of the interaction of light and the environment. This technique is computationally expensive because it actually simulates light as it bounces off objects and how it interacts.

Once they 've made the effect , they can still take  minutes to render a single frame of it - even using incredibly expensive , high-end computers. In a video game , that same effect has to run from every possible television camera angle , with every possible combination of other things going on at the same time. And the game has to render 24 frames of that action every single second - using only when the processing power of your 800 home PC. , A famine of processing power is the problem. ' , `` We 're a long mode off from having the computing power in a consumer-level machine to do photo-realistic graphics. This has to do with the math used and the tradeoff between looking good enough and truth. The more accurate you get , the more math it takes ( thusly more computing power required ). The jump in terms of computing power between practiced enough and accurate is huge. I 'm going to get a bit technical here. Phong shading is the technique we use in plot. It is essentially a collection of very simple mathematical formulas that give a very rough estimate of the colouring of something on your screen. In most guinea pig it looks good enough , but the model goes a bit nuts when you go to extremes. For good example reflections tend to be far too bright. The flaw get corrected with other mechanisms like shaders and so on. But again these are only approximation on the behavior of light. Over the years we 've ramp up better approximations and the expansion of computing power has allowed us to put a lot more stuff in there to make it look really good. We 've gotten damn safe at faking it , but at the end of the day all of this is built on an approximation of reality. Light is n't actually comprise simulated using this technique , therefore there will always be something that does n't look quite right. It take aim human intervention and an artist 's touch to make it look better. But you do n't have an artist sitting over your shoulder making adjustments to every human body in your game. indeed why are CG effects in movies so damn photo-realistic ? Well that 's because they actually do simulate light. They come n't use the same technique and mathematical models that are used in computer games. They use a technique called ray tracing which is a physics simulation of the interaction of light and the surround. This technique is computationally expensive because it actually simulates light as it ricochet off objects and how it interacts. This is thus computationally expensive that they use server farms to render individual frames of a scene in a movie. Games run at 20-60 fps on your home pc.

Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of AdaRem when training diverse models on a large-scale image recognition dataset , i. due east. , ImageNet , which too demonstrate that our method outperforms previous adaptive learning rate-based algorithms in terms of the training speed and the test error , respectively.

The trained CNN can be utilized for performing pose based visual servo control (PBVS). One of the ways to improve the quality of visual servo output is to improve the accuracy of the CNN for estimating the relative pose estimation. With a given state-of-the-art CNN for relative pose regression, how can we achieve an improved performance for visual servo control? In this paper, we explore switching of CNNs to improve the precision of visual servo control. The idea of switching a CNN is due to the fact that the dataset for training a relative camera pose regressor for visual servo control must contain variations in relative pose ranging from a very small scale to eventually a larger scale. We found that, training two different instances of the CNN, one for large-scale-displacements (LSD) and another for small-scale-displacements (SSD) and switching them during the visual servo execution yields better results than training a single CNN with the combined LSDSSD data. However, it causes extra storage overhead and switching decision is taken by a manually set threshold which may not be optimal for all the scenes. To eliminate these drawbacks, we propose an efficient switching strategy based on model agnostic meta learning (MAML) algorithm. In this, a single model is trained to learn parameters which are simultaneously good for multiple tasks, namely a binary classification for switching decision, a 6DOF pose regression for LSD data and also a 6DOF pose regression for SSD data.

{"original_text": "Around 2.5 million years ago (ending 11,600 years ago) was the geological period of the Ice Ages. Since approximately 600,000 years ago, six major Ice Ages have occurred, in which sea level dropped 120 m (390 ft) and much of the continental margins became exposed. In the Early Pleistocene, the Rhine followed a course to the northwest, through the present North Sea. During the so-called Anglian glaciation (450,000 yr BP, marine oxygen isotope stage 12), the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed, that overflowed through the English Channel.

{"original_text": "To measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem, one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem. However, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance. In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve.

{"original_text": "A method to lessen the magnitude of this heating and cooling was invented in 1804 by British engineer Arthur Woolf, who patented his Woolf high-pressure compound engine in 1805. In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced.

{"original_text": "The USSR's invasion of Afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region, also marked by increased American weapons sales, technology, and outright military presence. Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year. In November 2010, Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program, describing Iran as \"a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination.\"", "text_perturb": "The USSR 's invasion of Afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region , as well marked by increased American weapons sales , technology , and outright military presence.

Despite this, humanity's flawed understanding of science still produces reliable, reproduceable data. God intentionally engineered the whole of creation to be utterly misleading when confronted with rational investigation. All of this was done as an implicit test of faith.

The Devil has altered the whole of reality to reflect the above. This interpretation makes the Devil vastly more powerful than any interpretation I have seen.

{"original_text": "Sorry, this is mostly applicable to folks from the US, but feel free to weigh in no matter what. I'll bullet-point for my reasoning: More good folks are killed via firearms than are saved by them. The vast majority of firearm deaths are via suicide, which has an incredibly high success rate compared to all other methods. Therefore since firearms cause more deaths than they prevent, firearms pose a net-loss for society. One major reason we believe we need firearms is the 2nd amendment. The 2nd amendment is essentially an axiom; in order to have a moral argument as to why we should have guns, I don't think \"because the 2nd amendment says so\" is compelling. If the 2nd amendment told us to punch babies, that wouldn't make it okay. Therefore whether or not firearms are truly acceptable must be for a reason outside of this. Our logical balance doesn't make sense. To paraphrase John Oliver, one guy tried to blow up a plane with a shoe and now we all take our shoes off at security. But so many people shoot up so many schools, and we still haven't done anything substantial about it. On a similar note, we invest how many trillions of dollars on the war on terror, and yet the amount of Americans killed via guns exceeds the amount killed via terrorism by an extraordinary amount. I've read Scalia's opinion in D.C. v. Heller (The most important guns case in modern times). I don't find the appeal to history compelling. It seems to me that times have changed so much that arguing what Thomas Jefferson was thinking and then applying it to semi-automatic and automatic weapons just doesn't make sense. For someone who claims to be a textualist, this appears to me to be a stretch. The 2nd amendment and it's current interpretation quashes any possibility of experimentation. I think part of the American experiment is to allow different states to try different things. One of the arguments for gun rights is \"what worked for Australia couldn't work for us.\" And yet one only needs to look at Chicago (the city banned some firearms, SCOTUS said that was unacceptable and ruled against Chicago's law) to see that we were never given a chance to figure out what worked. I would normally suggest an amendment if we wanted to clarify the 2nd amendment for modern times, but it seems to me that nobody will ever be convinced guns are bad (or good!) until we have a concrete application and see whether it works or not.

To be clear, I am no fan of Huckabee, and I have nothing against our military or militaries in general. That said, I think he was dead on. I think most people who don't accept this do so because they think it's crass, and brutal. Well, yeah, but it's also absolutely true.

Again, I have absolutely no problem with this from a moral perspective. I am certainly not condemning anybody, just stating facts.

The internet we have now is just an unintended side effect. The US military is in a bit of a unique position, since they haven't had a lot of opportunities to do their job recently. Our military is so badass, there are not a lot of people with enough courage or stupidity to take us on. Thus, a lot of time is spent running practice drills and handing out food to people after earthquakes. That's great, but it's all a displacement activity until they need to do their real job. It's a sideshow, a distraction. The alternative would be these men sitting around, waiting for something to need destroying. We don't keep our military around and spend billions of dollars for disaster relief. We keep them around to kill people and break things. That's their real purpose, simple as that.

{"original_text": "Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in comparison to other nations in categories such as [infrastructure] , [poverty rates] , [education] , and so on. Usually, these show other nations, typically Scandinavian and other European countries, consistently coming out on top. This leads to a somewhat negative and unhealthy perception of America for both citizens and non-citizens that I think is unfair. This is because, in my view, there are 3 factors which hinder America's ability to keep up with its developed nation counter parts: Land Size Population Cultural Heterogeneity First, here is a top 5 list of the largest nations on Earth by square mileage, in order from largest to smallest: Russia Canada China United States Brazil The US is the 4th largest country on the planet, and as such, I think its ability to manage and update infrastructure is limited. A bullet train similar to those in Europe would be difficult in the US. Also, land from coast to coast is extremely diverse, ranging from plains, to mountains, to desert, to swamps, and so forth. Such a diverse biome requires diverse management of resources and is pretty difficult in my opinion. Now here's a top 5 list of countries by population, from largest to smallest: China India United States Indonesia Brazil Not only is America massive in terms of land area, it has a massive population as well. This high population puts financial strain on social nets, public education, and other public programs that can lead to problems. (This is not to say America wisely spends its money on its people, but that is a separate argument for another day). And yet compared to the other 4 most populous nations, it still maintains a high standard of living, relatively low poverty rate, and economic mobility. The only other country that hangs with America in both categories is China, which is massive in size and population. But America differs from China in one way, which is my third point a heterogeneous culture. The US was founded by immigrants, as a nation of immigrants, and diversity is only growing into the future. America features such a mixing pot of ethnicity and culture that it makes it difficult to enact programs that benefit everyone equally. I think this is most evident in education, where the US has the difficult task of creating a system that benefits every child in the best way possible. In China, a largely homogeneous population with high value on education should produce high results. And yet, despite having all three of these factors to consider, the United States is ranked [5th on the Human Development Index] as late as 2014. So, basically my argument is this The United States, being huge in size, huge in population, and having a heterogeneous culture, is at an instant disadvantage in comparison to other nations, and is doing pretty well for itself all things considered.

{"original_text": "Batman's strict no-killing policy has lead to the deaths of hundreds of people. Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who can stop the Joker. Additionally, it is obvious that Arkham cannot hold him. He has escaped countless times, and every time, Batman has to go recapture him (after he's killed or injured who-knows-how-many people). Ostensibly, Batman's no-killing policy is a self imposed check on his inner demons that he is sure will consume him if he gives into them. I believe that, in reality, he uses this policy as a security blanket he can cling to so that he doesn't have to get his hands dirty and make a difficult decision. I think he wraps up his own cowardice in a cloak of self-righteousness (albeit a fireproof, bulletproof cloak). Here are my main views 1) The only way to stop the Joker is to kill or permanently incapacitate him 2) Batman has a moral obligation to kill or incapacitate the Joker since the state can't or won't do it. 3) He bares responsibility for everyone the Joker harms. Important Points The Joker is responsible for everyone he kills. The full burden of each person's murder is on his head. This CMV in no way negates his responsibility for his actions. Batman is not equally as responsible as the Joker for the people he kills. I'm not attempting to assign a specific amount of blame to Batman.

It's very important that you keep in mind, I'm notasking about any of the following: Do you have a societal obligation to save them Would you feel obligated to help Do you have a responsibility to do so Would you judge someone for not saving them Should it be illegal to ignore them Again, I am not asking any of these questions, as I believe that any decent human would hop in and save the kid. I'll even suspend judgement if you want to take the time to take your shoes off and put your phone in them. I came to the conclusion that you are not in fact morally obligated to help. Consider the analogy between saving the drowning girl and using your time money to save starving children in another country. What is the difference? They are farther away, they are not part of your community, you can't see the help you provide, you can't see them suffer in the first place, you don't know for sure if you are helping by sending money, it would be much more difficult to provide direct assistance, they have longer to live from the time we would decide to help, they may recieve help from someone else. None of those reasons would be an excuse to ignore a moral obligation. If we truly believed that it was our moral obligation to help the drowning child, why would it not also be our obligation to help every other human in need according to our closest approximation of how we could theoretically devote our lives to helping the greatest possible number of people. It is of course possible that you believe this in which case almost every human ever is hugely immoral, but I think that defining morality in this way would make the word meaningless, and it is not useful - nor is it a reasonable definition for morality. On the other hand, there is a moral belief system that would treat morality as if you had no obligation to help anyone, and an unwarrented harm would be immoral, whereas helping people or leaving them alone would be considered positive or neutral respectively. If we accept this stance, than leaving the child to drown would be considered a morally neutral (or amoral) action. It would still be considered a horrible thing to do by most anyone, but people's emotional responses have no bearing on objective morality. (there may be exceptions for emotional distress caused by a person, but since our hypothetical passerby is not the cause of the child drowning, you cannot hold him accountable for the emotional consequences) This scenario is also closely related to the train thought experiment, where you are standing by the lever that switches the direction a train is going. On it's current path, it will hit five men. If you change the path, it will hit one man. By the logic I have put forth, it would be immoral to flip the lever, thus condemning the one man, but it would be morally neutral to let the train hit the five men (assuming that no further information or alternatives are available) I would have to reconsider this stance if the analogy were proven false, or a better explanation to the moral dilemmas were presented. I am also operating under the assumtion that morality is objective as it relates to humans, and therefor a principle must be established which applies equally to all scenarios in which your interpritation of what constitutes a moral action can be right or wrong, and is only up for interpritation in cases dealing with immoral agents in which actions that would be considered immoral (like murder) would be considered justified (like murdering someone who is going to murder you).", "text_perturb": "This is a farseeing one. . .

{"original_text": "I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is the far superior option. Cleanliness In this area, I prefer toilet paper for a few reasons. First of all, there is actual visual confirmation that you've got it all. With bidets you just have to keep spraying until you think you're good. And as the amount of wipingbidet-ing can vary greatly, the visual aspect is a great help. (I used a towel to dab afterwards, as toilet paper doesn't hold up against all the water.) Secondly, a bidet shouldn't be necessary as people (should) shower daily. Many people like to point out that bidets are better because they rinse away bacteria and other nastiness. But, a shower with actual soap and water and scrubbing should do that job much better than just water alone. \"But you wouldn't just wipe it away if you got some on your hands!\" No, and I don't think you'd just rinse it away either. You'd use soap and water and scrubbing. Another point, your hands are usually the first thing you use to touch something. Until you grab things with your bare ass, wiping is just as good. Comfort Good quality toilet paper is amazing. It's soft, thick, almost like Kleenex. Hell, you could wipe with Kleenex if you wanted. Point is that high quality stuff is glorious. On the other hand, you're getting a cold spray of water in a very sensitive area. Even if you have a super luxury bidet that uses heated water, it's still basically shooting water up your ass. Even low quality toilet paper is better than that. In a shower the water flows down, which is much less uncomfortable. With a bidet there's also the added trouble of being all drippy with water while you move to towel off. And unless you want to reach into the bowl with a towel while you're still sitting on it, you're going to have to at least move up to a squat to towel off. (Those with an air dryer feature may alleviate this somewhat, but toweling will probably still be necessary if the air hand dryers are anything to go by.) Price I understand bidets cost less. But for me and where I am in life, I can and will pay extra for quality. There must be many others who feel the same, or else only single ply sand paper toilet paper would exist. In this area bidets are better, but I think that if this is the reason someone buys a bidet it would be because they have to save money. Eco friendliness I think we're past the whole'save the trees' business. Reforestation is greater than reforestation in most of the world. Bidets may actually do more harm in low water and drought areas, if everyone dropped toilet paper and got bidets the gallons would add up. To clarify; I'm talking about a bidet for home use, that's built into the toilet. The bidets that are completely separate just seem impractical. Edit: The point here is that given a choice between a bidet and toilet paper, toilet paper is better. In situations where there's no other alternatives, of course one will be used over the other.

{"original_text": "First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. The rules don't tell you to give up your seat for her, but you do. This short scenario illustrates that rules and morals are two different things. However, I see more and more people defending actions saying it was \"legal,\" and therefore it should be alright. The death of Cecil the lion is an (extreme) example: the man who shot him defended himself by declaring that what he did was legal. As the global outrage over his actions showed us, it was however completely immoral. Another example: bankers. I read in a book that bankers that are considered \"professional\" disregard their own morals as much as possible and instead try to do as much as is legally possible. Immoral bankers and brokers are a core part of why the 2008 crisis was able to happen. I think this illustrates what happens when people use the law as \"moral compass\": immoral behavior. Secondly, I think this is caused by the fact that our law is not our morals themselves but rather these morals applied into (simplified) rules. Thirdly, I think it's impossible to enforce socially appropriate behavior like giving up your bus seat.

{"original_text": "Please note before reading: Please do not downvote my comments and replies on basis of disagreement. I've done several CMV's where I was the clear minority in terms of viewpoint, and got downvoted on nearly every post. Due to Reddit's karma system, this makes me wait a period of 7 minutes in between replies if my karma is low, and makes it more difficult for me to respond to everyone (the more karma you have, the less time you need to wait to post). If I act like a dick to you, act irrational, or say something logically fallacious, I implore you to downvote me, but I'd really like to be able to discuss with everybody and not be held back by my inability to reply (and consequently hear replies). Okay, onto my view. I'm not worried about the US government spying on citizens, for the following reasons. 1. I don't necessarily \"have nothing to hide,\" but I don't expect that there is literally a person on a computer looking through what I post to Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook (or what porn I look at). I have some personal things I wouldn't want an actual person to know or look through, but I feel entirely comfortable with a machine using a CTRL-F function to search for terrorist activity, or other organized illegal activities since I don't commit any major crime. I know a lot of people are worried about the government seeing people torrenting things illegally or watching moviesshows illegally on the internet, but considering how widely this is done and how nonexistent people are prosecuted for it based on the governments ability to view all this, I'm not worried about it. I don't do drugs, but if I did and tried to buy drugs over FB or text, I doubt the government would even care. We have rtrees for instance, thousands of people openly doing minor illegal things and the government doesn't care enough to try and arrest them. 2. I remember hearing during Rand Paul's filibuster that there has been terrorist activity stopped by government spying on people. I think government spying still has an effect as a deterrent (terrorists can't use media to communicate, and therefore it makes terrorist activity harder to commit. I also heard during the filibuster that the government was using spying to take down organized crime. I'm not worried about that, considering I'm not involved in organized crime and therefore am not worried about it. (I'd like to point out here, that it's not really a view regarding sympathy or empathy towards criminals and what rights they should have to privacy, but simply my feeling of worry about being spied on). I don't view the NSA spying on druglords to be much different than wire taps or undercover officers. 3. In addition to the above, I have the view that Islamic extremism is, as of ISIS' international attacks (or extremist Muslims inspired by ISIS at least), a legitimate threat to the United States. There have been US citizens that have gone to fight for ISIS and local Islamic extremist attacks, and believe the US should be able to spy on their communications. They have claimed to have thousands of people in the US, and while that may be an exaggeration, I don't believe it to be unbelievable considering they have had 150 individuals that have travelled to Syria to fight for ISIS (Source:). I would expect if many people are willing to take the trouble to travel to another country to fight others, it's not unexpected that they more would stay in the US to try and perform terrorist activity here considering it would be easier. 4. I'm not worried about the government knowing my political views. I broadcast them publicly on Facebook, and considering our country's devotion to free speech as well as multiple political parties, I don't view any dissent to be any threat to my well-being.

{"original_text": "The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line, but it is often well after substantial ambiguous conversation. For the purpose of this CMV, I will grant that a fetus is a human person. My views: 1. Abortion may or may not be morally permissible, though I lean towards permissible. I don't really want to discuss this aspect of it, but it's here for some background on my position. 2. Abortion should be legal, based primarily on my foundational belief on bodily autonomy. To change my view, you will probably need to change my belief that the mother's legal right to control her own body overrides the fetus' (or child's) right to use them. One of the main objections to legal abortion is the sense that the woman has incurred a sort of responsibility to the child by engaging in sex (for this CMV, I'd prefer to only consider consensual sex). While this may be true, I see it at most to be a moral obligation, not a legal one. The best analogy I've heard is as follows: Let's say you are driving recklessly and run over a pedestrian. The ambulance arrives and does a quick blood test and determines that unless you donate a pint of blood to that pedestrian, he will die. You hate needles and refuse. At the moment, you cannot be legally compelled to donate your blood. If you can't be compelled to donate blood (which is almost completely safe) to save the life of someone he recklessly endangered, a woman should not be required to donate her internal organs for 9 months to a fetus to keep it alive. EDIT: There are probably other ways in which my view could be changed, but here is the conversation that changed my view first: ugarnteller: So, let's say there was a teleporter accident that caused the second head. You knew it was a risk going in. It will take 9 months for science to clone a body to host the head. Are you still free to kill it? My realization as I thought through the implications: This is again, a very difficult question and I had to put some thought into it before responding. Since we're into sci-fi land, lets look at the probable scenario: In a world where teleportation is a common mode of transport and head grafting was a possible (if somewhat uncommon) outcome, I wouldn't want to travel without knowing that whoever I traveled with (assuming these are the only people who get head-grafted) agreed to keep my head alive until my replacement body could be found. This would be a sort of additional agreement reached between the teleporters. Even in this scenario, I would be very hesitant make it a default law.... but I could easily see that it could become that way if enough people used teleportation and the head-grafting continued to happen. So, I guess the short answer is that I am of the opinion that it should be possible to sign away a certain level of bodily autonomy to secure a level of personal safety. After all, you could be the grafted head next time. This seems to severely impact my position, since an actual analogous scenario would be where the teleporter picks up a random person (who did not choose to teleport) and has their head grafted to their body.

{"original_text": "For the purpose of this post, I am defining \"capitalism\" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. \"Socialism\" is defined as a system in which the government owns the means of production, and distributes all things necessary for decent quality of life (food, water, shelter, education, health care, etc) for free to all minors and any adult either working, seeking work, or enrolled in school. I understand that this definition is more specific than the true definition of socialism, but I want to preempt any arguments suggesting that people won't look for work if everything is provided for them anyway; they won't be provided for unless they contribute. Also, please note that I am not advocating any specific system of governance; I don't want a debate about the merits of direct democracy. Assume that the system of governance is something effective and relatively democratic, unless there is a compelling reason why my definition of socialism ensures ineffective government. With that out of the way, here is my justification. I believe that capitalism ensures exploitation of the lower-classes. The winners in a capitalist system are nearly always those who were born into relative wealth already. Even the rags-to-riches stories of our time, such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, they were all born into at least lower-middle class. Those trapped in poverty are normal people, who usually work much harder than the people at the top, and get nothing for it. I don't mean to put down high-ranking executives, or other wealthy individuals, but I think that if capitalism is designed to benefit those who work hard, it's doing a shoddy job. Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair. And that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression. Not only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a \"Green!\" or \"Eco-Friendly\" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot). So, with those reasons put out for why capitalism is bad, here's why I think socialism is better. Socialism prevents needless death and suffering by ensuring that everyone who contributes gets everything they need for a healthy life. Socialism ends cyclical poverty by giving everyone a chance at education, without worries about putting food on the table. Socialism is better for rewarding the hard-workers and punishing the slackers, because without unfair head starts going to rich kids entering the workforce, the real cream will rise to the top (there would be variable wages and such; the government employers could offer raises and promotions to their best workers). Socialism is better for the environment, because the government could have direct control, and would have much more incentive to manage the environment in sustainable ways than short-term-minded corporations. I guess I can go further in depth in my replies, if needed. I'm looking for a good debate, and maybe a change of heart. Change my view! EDIT: OK all, so I have been persuaded by a combination of factors that socialism as I define it is not as good as capitalism with generous welfare policies and heavy regulations (think Nordic model). I'll be giving out deltas now. I will continue debating as well, but I think I'm done for now. I will resume later. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Ideally , in the future , if someone were to come into a doctor 's office and say `` I feel so bad in my current body that I want hormonal treatment and invasive surgery '' the doctor would be able bodied to prescribe something that would just make the transgender person no longer feel terrible in their current body.

It should be the other way around, if only for practical reasons (the respect of older people tend to be far more valuable). Now, I'm in no way denying that younger folks have valid and interesting contribution to make. I think a fresh perspective coupled with energy and enthusiasm can be an exceptional driving force. Nor am I denying that older folks can be complete assholes because their certainly can. However, I could never bring myself to expect older, more experience and better established people to prove themselves to me. Neither can I see a reason to prove myself to younger people today. I expect respect the same way my father or professors did. Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers. Simply put, I find this phrase respect is earned, not given is most often used pompously by younger people to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason. To my eye, this attitude is the product of four big misconceptions: 1) Older people demand respect because of their age and age by itself isn't worthy of respect. I do agree that age by itself isn't a quality worthy of respect, but I don't think older folks demand respect in virtue of their age alone either. Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life. 2) Showing respect and deference to others cost me something. Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego.

{"original_text": "Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate \"News\" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand \"BuzzFeed News\" as separate from the rest of BuzzFeed, it's alright. Still not going to use it for my news (or anything really) but definitely see it in a new light. Thanks for the perspective and interesting discussion guys! Buzzfeed is a terrible news organization. They are basically the death of journalism. They focus on vague clickbait headlines for the sole purpose of gather views ultimately to make the most ad money possible. I feel this is clearly a sign of a lack of journalistic integrity. Headlines are meant to inform, not confuse. \"Obama said something AMAZING at the state of the union, and you won't believe the reaction!\" What is that?! That's not informing me, bringing me valuable information. It's vague, biased, uninformative, and purely designed just to get a click. Buzzfeed also focuses on native advertisement and meaningless lists which makes it dangerous for the uniformed who cannot discern between what is news and what isn't and ultimately lose a valuable skill in determining what is a good source and what is not. They also plagiarize, which immediately makes an institution lose all credibility. I've had this view for a while and mostly kept to myself about it, but last night someone brought the topic up and to my surprise a journalism student actually started to praisedefend BuzzFeed. So I figured I would post the big counter points she made and why they aren't legitimate. 1. BuzzFeed has a large base \"BuzzFeed has revolutionized how news organizations attract viewership and the mass consumption of BuzzFeed show it's prowess in journalism. Journalism is about consumption\" This is a silly point. Just because a lot of people read BuzzFeed does not mean it is a legitimate news organization. Sure, it's impressive BuzzFeed can attract so many people to their site through social media and clickbait, but so what? The New York Times could slap a big naked lady on their front page and I'm sure it would increase viewership, but I think we can all agree that doesn't make it better news. And I don't believe journalism is about consumptiongetting the most consumption. If the goal is to just get people to readbuy their articles, there is no incentive to generate good news. Everything will just be tabloids. 2. Every news organization is copying BuzzFeed \"The Washington Post, CNN, Fox News are all scrambling to adopt BuzzFeed's revolutionary model. They can't keep up with BuzzFeed's dominance. They're copying BuzzFeed because it's so good!\" Yea, can't argue there. All these news organizations are copying BuzzFeed. And that hurts journalism. Now all sources are turning to clickbait baloney. BuzzFeed is killing the market because they don't have integrity and are willing to make meaningless posts that are designed to go viral. So now in order to compete, all other news organizations must do the same, which hurts journalism. It is now quite hard to find an unbiased, un-editorialized news source. 3.They do really good pieces \"I'll admit 90 of BuzzFeed is stupid, meaningless posts, but they actually do really good pieces. They've started a whole field of'explanatory news' and really tries to educate a reader. Most news organizations just assume you know all the background of a piece, but most don't. So these pieces really help the public understand current event.\" That's great! They should focus on that then! Just because there are good pieces dotted around the site, doesn't mean it's a good news source. If I see a guy down a steak I'm not going to eat his poop just because there might be some prime rib in there. The New York Times does similar things, where they'll have a 30 page story on something like an avalanche explaining the mountain, back country skiing, the days leading up to it, the backstory to all involved. It's great stuff and they don't have \"17 Pizza's that look like Ohio\" as the next article cued up. I think it's also bad because it gives BuzzFeed credibility. So they can point to the handful of articles and say they're real news when people call them out for their mass quantities of meaningless malarky. 4.They get people to read the news \"Sure, there's a lot of crap, but it gets people reading the news, which traditional media doesn't do. The clickbait gets people reading! You realize it's crap because you're an educated person who goes to a private college, but most people don't. So it doesn't really matter because those people now read the news where they wouldn't have before.\" It's true. People who didn't read the news do now thanks to BuzzFeed. But shouldn't we focus on giving those people an education, teach them to evaluate news sources, give them the tools to discern bias and editorialization? Why are we bringing news down to the lowest common denominator just so more people read it? If we ruin journalism in the process, does it really matter if more people have access to it? Also, I think it's really dangerous to do so because now those who previously didn't read the news have BuzzFeed as their introduction to newsjournalism. Those people who aren't educated or didn't read the news now are much more susceptible to native advertisement. So now there's possibly a whole host of people who think \"This diet pill made these 12 fitness instructors resign because they couldn't compete!\" is real news and not just advertisement for a useless sugar pill. 5.It's a new platform, the next evolution \"You just don't understand this new platform. It's like how print journalism first went on the web. People said the same things you're saying back then but it turned out fine. You just need to realize it's a new age for journalism and you must adapt.\" Print journalism going on the web was just that. Putting the news on the web. It wasn't changing the what people receive or altering news or putting in ads that look like news. It was just giving a new out for people to access news from. I know social media is big and is a powerful tool, but you can use it without making this clickbait nothings. Tweet out the headline with a link, have a'share on facebook' button on the article, post it to reddit. Use the tools to increase access to information, not to destroy it. I'm sure one day well all have personal holograms and that will be a new platform for news. But a hologram of \"3 of the cutest puppies that show black lives matter\" still isn't news. That's the major points I head in defense of BuzzFeed. There were a few more but all under those general points and nothing that CMV. I think the real dangerous part of all this is that all those points I just listed are being taught in journalism classes at renowned institutions. BuzzFeed is now the accepted and taught method for delivering the news. I fear this could be the death of journalism. I always thought \"BuzzFeed is kinda dumb, but hey, if people like looking at silly lists, who am I to say they can't.\" But now these silly lists are being hailed as the height of contemporary journalism! It seems were doomed to editorialized, plagiarized, uninformative clickbait for our news from now on. Anyway, just looking for someone to change my view. I actually would like it if someone changed my view because it would be great to go look at silly lists all day. Seems like a good way to kill time but I don't want to support BuzzFeed.

Buzzfeed is a terrible word organization. They are basically the death of news media. They focus on vague clickbait headlines for the sole purpose of gather vista ultimately to make the most ad money possible. I feel this is clearly a signboard of a lack of journalistic integrity. newspaper headline are meant to inform , not confuse. `` Obama said something AMAZING at the state of the union , and you wo n't believe the chemical reaction ! '' What is that ? ! That 's not informing me , bringing me valuable information. It 's vague , biased , uninformative , and purely designed just to catch a click. Buzzfeed also focuses on native advertisement and meaningless lists which makes it dangerous for the uniformed who can not discern between what exist news and what exist n't and ultimately lose a valuable skill in determining what exist a good source and what exist not.

{"original_text": "Marriage as a word comes from the Middle english word mariage, which according to sources from Wikipedia, comes from around CE. Word comes from another Old French word then to a Latin word maritare, which describes a husband and wife. Adding on top of that, many modern religions using the word to describe the ceremony as a marriage between one man and one woman, I see that the word Marriage is intrinsically religious. Now moving to modern day, Marriage is changing as many people are adding tochanging the meaning to a word that many people use as a religious word. People are getting up in arms about these and I can see their points. Marriage in a lot of religions these days is still defined as one man and one woman. Now have a courtgovernment adding tochanging that definition of that word, this is where I believe the whole issue is. The issue with people not wanting gay marriage based off religious beliefs is because a word is being used for something that it does not mean to them. Marriage isfrom religion and should keep it that way. We need to rename Marriage in the government to remove this part of the issue that the anti-gay marriage community has with it. Now I know it still won't remove the whole problem that the anti-gay community has with gay marriage but I believe it will remove everyone who dislikes that this word, that is so entrenched in religion, is being redefined by a government decision. I even see a huge problem with these, I am not religious and completely for two consenting people getting married, no matter whowhat they are. The government needs to change its vocabulary so that when you want your union to be legal, you go get a Civil Union (Or whatever we call it) from the government. But if you want to get married, you must find a religion that accepts your union. This returns marriage to Religion and I believe removes a huge part of the problems we are having in the acceptance of this practice. [Source of Etymology] HUGE EDIT: So uawa64 and ucptal has brought to my attention some information. The intrinsic nature of the word marriage that I was bringing up has some flaws. The act of marriage seems to have been more of a social thing rather than a religious thing off the bat. The church seemed to basically be the best at keeping records and the sacrament didn't come until later. So even though the nature of the word has been pretty much a religious definition for a while, the word itself is not intrinsically religious. [Here] and [Here] are their sources they brought to me. So with further communications with others, I have been bringing up that society is changing the word marriage and my view is more of a fix to speed up that change at least on the religious vs government front.

My massive issue with the game is that the current meta relies too heavily on strung together mech cards that perfectly mesh with each other and do no evoke a skill-based theme or tactic.

The rarity of these cards even further prove that it benefits those who purchase packs in bulk and get them quicker, letting them get \"better\" faster and leave other players in the dust. Blizzard has also recently lowered the chance of getting decent dailies, meaning you have a lower chance of generating in game currency, further benefiting the payers.

Another thing is that Legendaries are totally whack as a nitty gritty concept. They come off as useful tools to take out foes but are secretly a ploy to get `` consumers '' to buy packs to taste and earn them ( in a free-to-play game ). The rarity of these cards even further prove that it benefits those who purchase packs in bulk and get them fast , letting them get `` better '' faster and leave other players in the dust. Blizzard has also recently lowered the hazard of getting decent dailies , meaning you have a lower hazard of generating in game currency , further benefiting the payers. Cards involving random chance while also altering the mana curve ( Voidcaller , Unstoppable Portal , Alarm-o-Bot ) are devastating and should non exist. This is different than druid 's mana increasing cards as this is a calculated strategy that is understood by the opponent. Hello , users of cytomegalovirus ! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"original_text": "EDIT: Haha the amount of downvotes on this is crazy. Looks like I hit a nerve or something. First, I define \"enthusiastic consent\" the state of consenting to sex not only technically (i.e. saying yes regardless of context) but also with clear demonstration that you are excited and happy about the prospect. It's a big deal in many feminist spaces, most prominently including the feminist subreddits here (ie. twoxchromosomes, raskwomen, rfeminism, etc). A lot of feminists I have spoken to would like to see a society where there's a legal requirement for one party to get enthusiastic consent before doing anything physical with another party. Not getting enthusiastic consent would be, in this ideal society, seen as rape and would lead to criminal charges. This would include cases where the girl either participated and didn't say no, meekly said yes, reluctantly agreed, said yes after saying no a few times, etc. First of all, I strongly disagree with the entire concept of enthusiastic consent because I think it is infantalizing women and denying them agency - basically telling them that when they say \"yes\" it isn't enough, they need to be clearer about it. If a woman is just naturally meek? Tough luck. But that's not the main part of my post. I believe that if we as a society teach our children enthusiastic consent and pressure people to follow it, then it is only logical that we apply the principle to other things besides sex. Why put up sex on a pedestal? Why is sex the only situation where we should expect a person to be excited about what they're doing? Why do we put up sex as such as sacred cow? - If a customer is buying a product, they should have to legally and morally demonstrate enthusiastic consent. If a store owner manages to persuade them of the product's viability and they finally give up and say \"oh, okay, I'll get it\" - then the storeowner should be charged with theft. It's basically a mugging at that point because the customer bought the product reluctantly, right? At the very least, the storeowner should be shamed and ostracized by society for his actions. - Politicians should not be allowed to aggressively campaign and try hard to convince fence-sitting voters to vote for them. That would be considered mental pressure. If a person votes for a politician reluctantly (ie. \"well, he's the least of two evils after being approached repeatedly by that politician's supporters, frequently handed pamphlets, etc - then the politician and hisher supporters should be arrested. After all, the voter was pressured into supporting that politician, right? The voter didn't do so with enthusiasm. A lot of feminists should see this as coercion. These are just two examples of what I honestly believe is a logical continuation of \"enthusiastic consent.\" There is no rational basis for limiting that concept to just sex, if we accept it as a society. To be clear, I don't support such a society. My argument is that the feminists who aggressively spread the concept of enthusiastic consent should logically want to apply it to other areas as well - pretty much any situation where a person is doing something unenthusiastically after being persuaded. Please change my view. TL;DR: Enthusiastic consent, if we accept it as a society, shouldn't be limited to sex. It is only logical to apply it to a variety of other situations, basically anytime someone does something after being mentally pressured. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

If a store owner manages to persuade them of the product 's viability and they finally give up and say `` oh , all right , I 'll get it '' - then the storeowner should be charged with theft. It 's basically a mugging at that point because the customer bought the product reluctantly , right ? At the very least , the storeowner should be shamed and ostracized by society for his activity. - Politicians should not equal allowed to aggressively campaign and try hard to convince fence-sitting voters to vote for them. That would be considered mental pressure. If a someone votes for a politician reluctantly ( ie. `` well , he 's the least of two evils after being approached repeatedly by that politician 's champion , frequently handed pamphlets , etc - then the politician and hisher champion should be arrested. After all , the voter was pressured into supporting that politician , right ? The voter did n't do and so with enthusiasm. A caboodle of feminists should see this as coercion. These are just two examples of what I honestly believe is a consistent continuation of `` enthusiastic consent. `` There is no rational basis for confine that concept to just sex , if we accept it as a society. To be clean , I do n't support such a society. My argument is that the feminists who aggressively spread the concept of enthusiastic consent should logically want to apply it to other areas as well - passably much any situation where a person is doing something unenthusiastically after being persuaded. Please change my thought. TL ; DR : Enthusiastic consent , if we accept it as a society , should n't be limited to wind up. It is only ordered to apply it to a variety of other situations , basically anytime someone does something after being mentally pressured. Hello , users of CMV !

{"original_text": "This type of post has probably already been made a handful of times but I wanted to include some of my own thoughts. I live in the UK, so I have grown up in a country that does provide universal healthcare. I firmly believe in this model from an ethical and social standpoint. I've recently started reading the book Freakonomics. I wanted to see some discussions of the book on reddit, and I came across an AmA of the author, Steven Levitt. Somebody asked him his views on universal healthcare, to which he replied; 'I'm not so sure about universal healthcare. what i think we really need is for people to pay a big chunk of their own health care costs so the whole system starts to act more like a market and less like an entitlement. when health care is 20 of GDP, we can't treat it like an all you can eat buffet.' Now, I'm not ranting or saying I flat out disagree with his statement factually, because I do not know enough about financial economics to do so, but as somebody who believes universal healthcare \"should\" be a human right, or 'entitlement' as Steven Levitt has put it, I struggle to understand how humanity as a whole would benefit from persisting with privatised health care. Essentially, to change my view, I would need to be convinced that privatised health care actually does have longstanding benefits for humanity, and not just for the 'economy'. Perhaps sustaining the economy and longevity of humanity come hand in hand, but I've always felt privatised health care primarily serves the rich who own it, and to deny healthcare to somebody who cannot afford it seems outright inhumane to me.

{"original_text": "The issue of blacks being \"disproportionately affected\" by police violence is simple. Black people have only have civil rights for 50 years or so. Without civil rights it's kind of hard to get a decent job, or get a quality education. This leads to generational poverty. Many white people have at least someone in their family who could bail them out in a financial pinch. Many black people do not have that. Imagine if everyone in your immediate family that you could reach out to for help was just as poor as you. While this is a reality for whites as well, it is a harsh reality for a larger number of blacks. When you have generational poverty, it's a lot harder to break out of poverty yourself, when you have no positive influences and noone to support you while you go to school, or teach you etc. When you are in poverty, you tend to be more desperate and commit more crimes. When you commit more crimes, you tend to interact with the police more. The more desperate you are, the more violent crimes you commit, and the more lethal the response from police. It is true, black people do commit a disproportionate number of crimes compared to white people, but they also are disproportionately poorer, which as I stated leads to desperation. (NOTE: There are more white criminals than black criminals, but only because black people are a minority. Black people are proportionately charged with crimes more than white people) Am I excusing the behavior of criminals? No, I am simply cosigning those that trumpet the \"black crime statistics\" as it is indeed a societal problem, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the color of their skin or genetics, and everything to do with cause and effect over the last 150 years. Am I saying we should feel white guilt? Fuck no, I sure as hell don't. Even the most persecuted members of this country have it far better than the starving people in other countries. It is what it is. The only way out of this mess, in my opinion, is to fund all schools equally. Give an equal share of tax dollars to the rich schools as well as the inner city ones. Then our next generation might have a chance at producing less criminals (of any race). Why does Beverly Hills High need a day spa, when Compton High can't afford working computers? I'm not advocating a re-distribution of wealth, but when it comes to government provided services, they should all be provided equally, especially something as crucial as this. I am absolutely against giving blanket handouts to poor people. I am not a fan of public assistance. Technically though, we are all on the public assistance dole unless you send your kids to private school. If you want to break the cycle of poverty, provide kids of all socioeconomic classes a fair chance. Giving special college grants to people of a specific, disadvantaged race or class is worthless, because at that point they already received an inferior education from their crappy public school, and by letting them into your college with a lower score you are lowering the standard for everyone. Invest all the NAACPaffirmative action college grant BS into public schools instead so they can get into college on their own merit. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Happy CMVing!", "text_perturb": "The issuance of blacks being `` disproportionately affected '' by police violence is simple. Black people have only have civil right for 50 years or so. Without civil rights it 's kind of hard to pay back a decent job , or pay back a quality education. This leads to generational poorness. many white people have at least someone in their family who could bail them out in a financial pinch. Many black people do not get that. Imagine if everyone in your immediate kinsfolk that you could reach out to for help was just as poor as you. While this is a reality for whites as well , it is a rough reality for a larger number of blacks. When you have generational poverty , it 's a lot harder to break out of poverty yourself , when you have no irrefutable influences and noone to support you while you go to school , or teach you etc. When you are in poverty , you tend to make up more desperate and commit more crimes. When you commit more than crimes , you tend to interact with the police more. The more desperate you are , the more violent crime you commit , and the more lethal the response from police. It is genuine , black people do commit a disproportionate number of crimes compared to white people , but they also are disproportionately poorer , which as I stated leads to desperation. ( NOTE : There make up more white criminals than black criminals , but only because black people make up a minority. Black people are proportionately charged with crimes more than white people ) Am I excusing the behavior of criminals ? No , I am simply cosigning those that trumpet the `` black crime statistics '' as it is indeed a societal problem , but it has absolutely nothing to do with the color of their skin or genetics , and everything to do with cause and effect over the last 150 eld. Am I saying we should feel white guilt ? Fuck no , I sure as hell coiffe n't. even the most persecuted members of this country have it far better than the starving people in other countries. It comprise what it comprise. The only elbow room out of this mess , in my opinion , is to fund all schools equally. Give an adequate share of tax dollars to the rich schools as well as the inner city ones. and so our next generation might have a chance at producing less criminals ( of any race ). Why behave Beverly Hills High need a day spa , when Compton High ca n't afford working computers ? I 'm not advocating a re-distribution of wealth , but when it comes to government provided services , they should all be provided equally , especially something as crucial as this. I am absolutely against giving blanket handouts to pathetic people. I am not a fan of public assistance. Technically though , we are all on the public assistance dole unless you send your kids to secret school. If you want to break the cycle of poorness , provide kids of all socioeconomic classes a fair chance. Giving special college grants to people of a specific , disadvantaged race or class is worthless , because at that point they already received an inferior education from their crappy public school , and by letting them into your college with a lower score you are turn down the standard for everyone. Invest all the NAACPaffirmative action college grant BS into public school instead so they can get into college on their own merit. Hello , users of cytomegalovirus !

{"original_text": "We've all heard the saying that a Jack of All Trades is a Master of None. I'm not here to say that this is completely true and that if you are good at many things you will never be a \"master\" at some skill or aspect of your life. What I am willing to argue is that benefits of being a Jack of All Trades far outweighs the benefits of being a master of one or few \"trades.\" For starters, the possibility of finding the thing that truly makes you happy and satisfied in life is lessened quite significantly if your endeavors are honed into a certain subject at an early age. The amount of time you spend on a certain skill, hobby, or whatever it may be is inversely related on the amount of time you spend on other aspects of your life. It is my opinion that when you decide on your calling and devote yourself almost entirely to it, you miss out on other precious and interesting opportunities that your life could include otherwise. There is no doubt in my mind that abundant success in life is generated by the willingness to make a sacrifices for the thing that you believe that you want the most. It is up to the individual to decide what matters to them the most. Personally though, I think this is such a misguided approach to life that often leaves people feeling unfulfilled when they approach an advanced age. Is \"success\" in life really that valuable to humans that they are willing to give up so much of their time to a specific task? The need to be recognized and respected as a master of a particular aspect of life is a major driving factor of the sacrifices people make. A Jack of All Trades in my opinion does not mean you have to be great or even good at the things that you try once, or even do on a regular basis. For sanity's sake though, let's just say a Jack of All Trades is \"good\" at many things and a Master is \"great\" at one thing. When you set your focus on being great at one aspect of your life, there is the potential to backseat so many other important things in your life. I think, perhaps, this is best explained with an example. I have a co-worker who is one of the most vocally well-versed, decorated, and revered employees at the company at which I am employed. I am still quite young, and I just graduated college and he is one of my mentors. Working with him has really shown me what true mastery looks like. However, he spends at least 60 hours a week at work for no real reason other than the fact that he is potentially obsessed with his work. At his age, I know for a fact he would rather be spending time with his grand kids; he doesn't view time the same way most others do, and as a result ends up leaving the office at 7 o'clock every night. I try not to work overtime unless we are really running behind on a project, because while I love my job, I don't feel the need to devote myself fully to the task. As a result, I am able to focus on so much else and I am not constantly thinking about one specific thing. The ability to detach myself from my career after I leave the office (or job site) really seems to subconsciously effect the rest of my day. I feel more energized when I workout and I don't mind studying other things or brushing up on languages other than English. I also get the opportunity to socialize more with friends when I leave work on time. Having weekends off means I have the potential to do whatever I want and I can pick up new hobbies along the way. So in short I am sacrificing the potential to be great at one thing for the potential to be good (or maybe even just experience) many other things. Please don't relegate this to being a work-a-holic and not being a work-a-holic. This was purely a life example that directly relates to the topic at hand. I am sure it is possible to be a Master of one or more things and still be good at a lot of other things, but my main point is that a Jack of All Trades is a much more interesting and fulfilling approach to life than dedication to a singular practice. Edit Here is the delta, thanks AnecdotallyExtant I will change your view with a single diagram. It will demonstrate that in order to become a master of one, a person must first become a Jack of all. As an anecdotal example: I am myself somewhere right around the transition between the eighth and ninth picture in that diagram. But I am also the handiest person I know around the house. I can and regularly do fox everything in my house nearly worthless with cars, but the home I'm solid. So again, to become a master of a single trade, one must first become a jack of all. Or one cannot understand his or her own trade out of context. This is why we start our educations in kindergarten and not in graduate studies. A wide, solid, strong and synthetic knowledge base is an absolute a priori necessity. Which means that it can only follow that a master of one is superior, because it includes a thorough training in the jack of all. Please read below if you want to see the diagram. Many others had the same argument, but you approached it from an angle that makes sense. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The amount of time you spend on a certain skill , hobby , or whatever it may be is inversely related on the amount of time you spend on other aspects of your lifespan. It is my opinion that when you decide on your calling and devote yourself about entirely to it , you miss out on other precious and interesting opportunities that your life could include otherwise. There is no doubt in my mind that abundant success in living is generated by the willingness to make a sacrifices for the thing that you believe that you want the most. It exist up to the individual to decide what matters to them the most. Personally though , I think this is such a misguided approach to life that often leaves people find unfulfilled when they approach an advanced age. Is `` success '' in life really that valuable to humans that they are willing to give up so much of their time to a specific task ? The need to be recognized and respected as a master of a particular aspect of life is a major driving factor of the sacrifices hoi polloi make. A Jack of All Trades in my opinion does not mean you have to be great or even good at the things that you try once , or even do on a regular footing. For sanity 's sake though , countenance 's just say a Jack of All Trades is `` good '' at many things and a Master is `` great '' at one thing. When you set your focus on being great at one aspect of your life , there is the potential to backseat so many other authoritative things in your life. I think , perhaps , this is best explained with an case. I birth a co-worker who is one of the most vocally well-versed , decorated , and revered employees at the company at which I am employed. I am still quite young , and I just fine tune college and he is one of my mentors. Working with him has really testify me what true mastery looks like. However , he spends at least 60 hours a week at work for no real reason early than the fact that he is potentially obsessed with his work. At his age , I know for a fact he would rather be spending time with his grand kids ; he does n't consider time the same way most others do , and as a result ends up leaving the office at 7 o'clock every night. I try not to work overtime unless we are really running behind on a project , because while I love my job , I do n't experience the need to devote myself fully to the task. As a final result , I am able to focus on so much else and I am not constantly thinking about one specific thing. The ability to detach myself from my career after I leave the office ( or job site ) really seems to subconsciously effect the sleep of my day. I feel more energized when I workout and I do n't mind studying other things or sweep up on languages other than English. I also get the opportunity to socialize more with friends when I allow for work on time. Having weekends off means I have the potential to do whatever I want and I can pick up new hobbies along the elbow room. So in short I am sacrificing the potential to be great at one thing for the potential to be good ( or perhaps even just experience ) many other things. Please do n't relegate this to being a work-a-holic and non being a work-a-holic. This was strictly a life example that directly relates to the topic at hand. I am sure it is possible to cost a Master of one or more things and still cost good at a lot of other things , but my main point is that a Jack of All Trades is a much more interesting and fulfilling approach to life than dedication to a singular practice. Edit Here embody the delta , thanks AnecdotallyExtant I will change your view with a single diagram. It will demonstrate that in order to become a superior of one , a person must first become a Jack of all. As an anecdotal example : I am myself someplace right around the transition between the eighth and ninth picture in that diagram. But I am also the handiest someone I know around the house. I can and regularly do fox everything in my house nearly worthless with machine , but the home I 'm solid. So again , to become a master of a single business deal , one must first become a jack of all. Or one can not understand his or her own trade out of linguistic context. This embody why we start our educations in kindergarten and not in graduate studies. A wide , solid , strong and synthetic knowledge base is an absolute a priori requisite. Which means that it can only follow that a master of one is superior , because it includes a thorough training in the old salt of all. Please record below if you want to see the diagram. Many others had the like argument , but you approached it from an angle that makes sense. Hello , drug user of CMV ! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"original_text": "Throwaway account, my main is used for school. I'm 28, male, and a grad student (chemistry). I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She frequently brings up marriage and talks about how she believes I'll never propose to her, and I've told her that I'm honestly not sure how I feel about the whole concept of marriage. I would have no problem staying with her for my entire life, but I just don't understand how a ring and a piece of paper makes any difference. Let me outline my preconceptions here: My parents' marriage fell apart due to infidelity and divorce. I watched my mom cheat on my dad, take all his money in court, and leave him psychologically damaged until the day he died. Admittedly it has me a bit scared. Here are the benefits I often hear claimed about marriage, along with my response to them: More sex: We've been like bunnies for the whole relationship (at least twice a day) and honestly I have a pretty low sex drive. It's already more than enough. Children: I don't want kids, don't have kids, and am 100 sterile by choice. Nothing to do about it. She is equally happy to go without them. Added financial benefit tax breaks: We already contribute equally to the relationship in terms of finances. We end up paying for everything about 5050. Tax breaks? Ok, sure, but that's not going to sell me on it right off the bat. Now here are some drawbacks I often see cited about marriage, along with my response: Expense: A ring is supposed to cost three month's salary?! A wedding costs over 10,000?! I'm a grad student, for crying out loud. This kind of stuff is absolutely not affordable, and even if it was it seems like a huge waste just to conform to a social norm. Paying more for a little bit of metal and rock than for a decent used car seems absolutely insane to me. Divorce Risk: Statistics don't lie. I have a 5050 chance of going through exactly what my late father did. I hate seeing how sad the thought of just being my girlfriend forever (but not my wife) makes her. I love this girl a lot, but I am also a very rational and logical person and can't seem to find the personal justification for marriage. Please, try to change my view - and thank you.

{"original_text": "Update! See Edit 2 below! I don't know much about politics. I have a pretty poor understanding of real world economics. I don't follow world events or watch the news. I generally don't bother to keep track of what's going on in the world unless it impacts me directly, or maybe I think there's something meaningful I can do to change it to my own benefit (which has never actually come up). When it comes to who should be elected in any local, state or federal capacity, or what laws should or should not be passed, I am simply not a qualified to provide input on any level. So why am I allowed to vote? Changing my view may require addressing the following positions of mine: If one wishes to cast any kind of vote related to government or legislation, one should be required to complete some sort of test to confirm that they understand the subject on which they are voting. This could include acknowledgment of a candidate's qualifications and positions, or the actual content of a particular bill. This has the added benefit of rendering wild claims and accusations made by the media, random bloggers, etc. less impactful on the views of the general public. Note: Regarding this point, I don't want to discuss the specific content of such tests. As a rule, I believe it can be known what is true and what isn't, and so let's assume that the pre-vote tests won't contain personal opinions or interpretations of the subject. If voting is limited to only citizens deemed \"qualified\" by some form of the process described in the previous bullet point, the general outcome is more likely to be better (e.g. the people are more likely to choose a candidate they will still approve of a year later, and there will be less confusion regarding what is contained in proposed bills, etc.). The \"right to vote\" should be a privilege that I am not entitled to if I'm not even going to take the time to research the subject. Change my view by convincing me that, as a 29 year old citizen of the United States of America, I deserve to be able to vote on important matters and issues without doing any research or showing that I understand what I'm voting foragainst. Edit 1: Changed some phrasing. Edit 2: IMPORTANT: The difficulty associated with determining who is qualified to vote and who isn't seems to be the main issue here. I can accept that, and kind of figured this would be the case. I would like to simplify things by clarifying the overall view that I would be interested in changing. My view is that, assuming we could somehow successfully identify qualified individuals for a given subject and restrict the polls to only these people, it would be advantageous to do so at the expense of the (Constitutional?) right to uninformed voting. In general, I feel that it's justifiable to say that no American citizen should be allowed to cast a vote regarding a subject about which heshe doesn't have a clear and accurate understanding.

As a rule , I believe it can be known what is truthful and what is n't , and so let 's assume that the pre-vote tests wo n't contain personal opinions or interpretations of the subject. If voting is fix to only citizens deemed `` qualified '' by some form of the process described in the previous bullet point , the general outcome is more likely to be better ( e. gm. the people are to a greater extent likely to choose a candidate they will still approve of a year later , and there will be less confusion regarding what is contained in proposed bills , etc. ). The `` right to vote '' should be a privilege that I am not entitled to if I 'm not even going to take the meter to research the subject. Change my view by convincing me that , as a 29 year old citizen of the United States of America , I deserve to be capable to vote on important matters and issues without doing any research or showing that I understand what I 'm voting foragainst. Edit 1 : Changed some verbiage. Edit 2 : IMPORTANT : The difficulty associated with determining who is specify to vote and who is n't seems to be the main issue here. I can swallow that , and kind of figured this would be the case. I would like to simplify things by clarifying the overall sight that I would be interested in changing. My view is that , assuming we could somehow successfully identify qualified individual for a given subject and restrict the polls to only these people , it would be advantageous to do so at the expense of the ( Constitutional ? ) right to uninformed voting. In general , I feel that it 's justifiable to say that no American citizen should be allowed to cast a vote regarding a subject about which heshe does n't birth a clear and accurate understanding. hullo , users of CMV !

{"original_text": "My post is inspired by [this article] in which a major politician proposes allowing college students to sell \"shares\" of their future earnings to investors in exchange for funding their education. I have seen people criticize this system as one of \"indentured servitude,\" presumably because for a period of years students could not be released from the requirement to pay a portion of their earnings to the investor (s). However, the current system of student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, amounting to a lifetime obligation anyway (or longer, if they die early and there are co-signers on the loan). Admittedly, fixed-amount loans are better for students who have unexpectedly high earnings so this system might discourage some risk-taking. But so does the current system for those who want to avoid the down-side unemployment and no long-term relief from student loans. A system of \"shares\" would likely also discourage investors from paying for worthless online degrees, or college amenities that do not advance future earnings. This is a relatively new concept for me, so I'm eager to hear from those who want to change my view, or at least help me refine my understanding of the trade-offs. Thanks for weighing in! Edit 1: Thanks for all the great comments and arguments so far. One delta awarded at this point to uPlexiglassPelican for suggesting it makes better sense to have the payment based on a percentage of income beyond a basic amount that would have come even without a degree. (ungxp has also convincingly argued that existing banks would not likely be the ones to enter this new format, but that doesn't persuade me the format is a bad idea. I think maybe formulaic, risk-averse banks should take a back seat in this arena.) Edit 2: Whoa! So many great comments and thoughts. Many here are presuming (as I admit I did when I first started the thread) that what major you choose would likely be a key factor for investors deciding who to fund. And so many people here are assuming that a share system would be the death of the liberal arts. Although no one has really argued to the contrary, I now think this is a misplaced emphasis. Although it is not central to my view, I'm inclined to think that getting a degree in any major at an ivy league school vs. any major at a local community college is going to be a bigger factor than your major choice within a given school. Also, the share system doesn't have to be a fixed percentage (though probably there is a natural maximum at the point it starts to discourage seeking work). Finally (and relatedly), getting a degree in something doesn't mean that you are compelled to work in that field. So getting an English degree from a second-rate university might wind up costing, say 12 of your earnings (above a certain threshold see edit 1) for the next 30 years, while getting a Math degree from Stanford might wind up costing 3 of your earnings. Edit 3: Thanks to all who participated in this spirited discussion. I'm going to wrap this up with a final delta to uhacksoncode who made clear to me that those who marry and have a spouse support them after college would need to be prepared to commit a portion of their joint income to repay the investor. Most of the rest of the comments at this point seem to be covering the same ground, which I have not found persuasive in my view that the proposed system is better than the student loan system: Investors would find this product more risky than loans, and so it would not fit the business model of banks Stupid people would no longer be able to, literally, mortgage their future to \"dream\" unrealistically Direct taxpayer funding of college might be better than either system. This deal would be better for some people than for others. For those who wind up making higher incomes, it would on average be a worse deal than existing student loans, for those who wind up making lower incomes it would on average be a better deal. Even if I agreed with these things, and mostly I do, they would not change my view. Finally, there has been a lot of discussion premised (and I was guilty of this too, at first) on the notion that your field of study would be a major driver for attracting investors. I'm coming around to the view that except in the case of very specialized programs (e.g. engineering, medicine), field of study won't be as big a factor as student achievement and quality of school overall.

{"original_text": "Rock and Roll music is no longer an important part of the cultural conversation. This is obviously not to say that there is no longer rock music being made, that that music is never popular, or that that contemporary rock music isn't good. But rock has become similar to jazz and classical - while there is still lots of it being made, it's not a powerful cultural force any more. The modern cultural conversation is being played out in hip-hop and EDM. Of the current Top 10 on the Billboard charts, the only rock single is \"Shut Up and Dance\" by Walk the Moon, at 9, and that song is heavily influenced by EDM. The current Song of the Summer is generally agreed to be Fetty Wap's \"Trap Queen.\" The most consistently popular rock band currently is probably either the Foo Fighters, a band that has been around since the late 90s and still plays a very similar style of music to what they were playing then (and arguably still owe a large portion of their popularity to nostalgia for Nirvana, a band whose largest cultural moment was 24 years ago), or the Black Keys, a band playing with a deliberately retro style. Tame Impala and Arcade Fire, two bands that have been lauded for their innovation in the rock genre have on their most recent albums embraced EDM influences, and largely moved away from guitar-based rock. I would argue that the most culturally important albums of the past few months have been outside of rock - Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp A Butterfly, Drake's If You're Reading This It's Too Late, Mark Ronson's Uptown Special, Taylor Swift's 1989 (in which she ditched her country roots for an embrace of EDM pop). There has been a lot of rock music recently that has been great too (Father John Misty, Courtney Barnett, Colleen Green, and Jim O'Rourke have all released albums I have absolutely loved, and I just listened to the new Titus Andronicus album yesterday) but that has become an exception, and as my examples point out, it's not really commercially popular or culturally relevant beyond a small core. I don't have a real problem with rock losing its cultural cachet.

Further, simply having a degree in a scientific background makes you aware of that background (he has a bachelor's in engineering from Cornell), but that doesn't make you a scientist in the field.

{"original_text": "I was first exposed to the universe by watching season 1 and 2 of the show. I really liked them and purchased the A Song of Ice and Fire books and loved them even more. Now, when I watch the new episodes or go back and watch those ones I initially liked it feels different. The show now seems like a rookie film students first attempt at portraying the book. The acting, budget, and sets all seem fine. Things like staging, dialogue, character's appearances and the plot's movements seem very obvious and amateurish. At first I played it off with rationale like, they have budget issues, or it's just harder to portray these complex scenes on television, or that they needed to shorten the storyline to fit it in a ten season show. Now I am starting to feel like the show's creators are really just amateurs. They are using the \"best\" books in the last two decades so of course the show is popular. But if someone without their rapey suckage had control, could it be that much better? Please change my view so I can enjoy the show again. I think to accomplish this someone has to either just absolutely school me on film knowledge or make me feel good about the fact that they didn't have a choice for toning basically everything down. Maybe I'm asking too much, if so I apologize. Translations of my words for clarity. Rapey suckage - using sexual violence in ways that seem to be more geared towards shocking the audience than furthering the plot. I'm actually thinking more of the rape scenes for Dany and Cersi. Staging - there is no subtly to the character's positioning in frames. As someone who is only a casual film observer I prefer a show like Breaking Bad where I have to watch it a second time to finally be able to see the importance of things like a character's positioning on camera. GOT seems amateurish when compared. Dialouge - too many corny phrasings and catch phrases (especially when they use modern idioms). I am currently trying to find a script online so I don't have to transcribe scenes to give you examples. They also do a poor job introducing characters and have to make up for it by having character's say their own names all the time Character's Appearance - Why can't people have the long hair and beards they are supposed to? Legolas had hair down to his waist and he was still a sex symbol. I know Tyrion can't really have his nose chopped off but their first casting or Daario left my head spinning. Plot's Movement - Given that they are cutting half of the books out there shouldn't be so many complaints out of non-book readers that the show is boring. Or is the general public just that impatient? Edit 3 - added a question mark Edit 4 - Maybe this context will help someone to see another angle to change my view to. I have a cousin who watched the show and read all the books who insists the show is better than the books but never gives me reasons.

At first I played it off with rationale like , they have budget issues , or it 's just harder to portray these complex scenes on video , or that they needed to shorten the storyline to fit it in a ten season show. Now I am starting to sense like the show 's creators are really just amateurs. They represent using the `` best '' books in the last two decades so of course the show is popular. But if someone without their rapey suckage had control , could it be that much better ? Please commute my view so I can enjoy the show again. I recall to accomplish this someone has to either just absolutely school me on film knowledge or make me feel good about the fact that they did n't have a choice for toning basically everything down. Maybe I 'm asking too much , if hence I apologize. Translations of my words for clearness. Rapey suckage - using sexual violence in ways that seem to be more than geared towards shocking the audience than furthering the plot. I 'm actually reckon more of the rape scenes for Dany and Cersi. Staging - there be no subtly to the character 's positioning in frames. As someone who is only a casual film observer I prefer a show like Breaking Bad where I have to watch it a second metre to finally be able to see the importance of things like a character 's positioning on camera. GOT seem amateurish when compared. Dialouge - too many corny phrasings and catch phrases ( especially when they use new idioms ). I am currently trying to find a script online so I do n't have to transcribe fit to give you examples. They also do a poor job introducing characters and have to make up for it by having character 's say their own names all the time Character 's Appearance - Why ca n't people have the long hair and beards they are supposed to ? Legolas had hair down to his waist and he make up still a sex symbol. I know Tyrion ca n't really have his nose chopped off but their initiatory casting or Daario left my head spinning. Plot 's Movement - Given that they are cutting half of the books out thither should n't be so many complaints out of non-book readers that the show is boring. Or is the general public just that impatient ? Edit 3 - add together a question mark Edit 4 - Maybe this context will help someone to see another angle to change my view to. I have a cousin who watched the appearance and read all the books who insists the appearance is better than the books but never gives me reasons. What could his statement possibly be ?", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, for example: 1. My child, my choice. Well, yes. And this is the closest one to a valid argument, IMO. But of course we put limits on what parents are allowed to do and choose for their children; you can't deprive your child of food or education (in the US) and be allowed to keep your child, so clearly it is NOT all your choice. While refusing vaccines is nowhere near on that level, not EVERY possible choice is equally acceptable, because your child is a person, not a piece of property. If the child had the capacity to refuse, I might be swayed, but unfortunately young babies can't understand vaccines on any reasonable level. And, more importantly, it IS still your choice under school vaccination schemes; you can choose to homeschool your child, or send them to private schools that don't care. Those choices aren't available to everyone and that's unfortunate (for far more important reasons than this), but...that's our current system anyway. Being rich gets you all kinds of benefits. I don't think this is different from being able to buy better medical care, better schools, better food, private tutors, and worlds more for your child if you have the resources (I do support basic income, which would alleviate this issue, but that's neither here nor there as we haven't got it). Public schools are a governmental service, and there are rules about who can and cannot use them. I think it is fine to say only vaccinated (or medically exempt) people can use them. 2. Not everyone can get vaccinated. That's why doctors are able to issue waivers for those not medically right for vaccination. This already happens and should continue. 3. Vaccines are dangerous. Not as dangerous as rampant infection. Honestly this is its own debate...But suffice it to say you are going to need some pretty major evidence to possibly CMV. I don't think it exists, but I won't rule it out. I don't really want to talk about vaccine efficacy as it has been done to death, but I guess if there's some truly amazing evidence... 4. Everyone is entitled to an education. They still are. Any unvaccinated child either needs to attend a non-public education option, be homeschooled or eschooled, provide a medical certificate that says they shouldn't be vaccinated, or get the shots. I don't necessarily have a strong view on the best way to handle noncompliance, and don't know enough about policy to say what would be most effective and just. Maybe fines for the parents? The same punishment as parents who refuse to send their kids to school or teach them at home for other reasons? I would not support removing the child from the home or incarcerating the parents, or any other severe punishment. What would change my view: evidence that such a policy would have clear public health risks, would unavoidably keep children from getting an education, or would have some other major negative effect on society. I also am open to the idea that it is fundamentally unjust, though it doesn't seem that way to me right now. Edit: My post focuses mainly on why I think mandatory vaccination isn't bad, but it occurred to me that it might be helpful to say why I think it's good. Mainly, I think it's good because it protects those who cannot be vaccinated and the minority of children for whom the vaccine was ineffective or wore off sooner than it \"should have\" based on medical guidelines. Children should be safe at school, and I think this promotes safety in a significant waysince children can die of preventable illness. Edit2: If vaccines are prohibitively expensive and can't be obtained for free, this system is pretty shit for poor families. In my area you can get free vaccines in certain conditions, which are very lenient. If this isn't true everywhere in the US (and it almost certainly isn't), it should be before vaccines are made mandatory. Edit3: Going to bed now, will respond to new posts tomorrow.

{"original_text": "Alright, 5hrs into this and I have not changed the view expressed in the title but I have conceded most of my original points thanks, in-part, to ubritainfan234. In summary, regardless of how an edit might affect others, that is the right of the comment owner. How people feel about that edit will be reflected in future voting. Now, what I do still stand by is that while you're entitled to edit your comment to say \"thank you\" or whatever you wish, you probably still shouldn't. Here is my new, primary argument: N1.) The reddit gold system is already designed to give you a chance to be thanked, but you knowingly reject this by choosing to send the gift anonymously. As a recipient of anonymous gold, editing your comment might express your appreciation to future readers, but the gilder will NOT be notified of your edit and they most likely will never see it. They rejected their chance to be thanked by checking the anonymous button and there is no remaining obligation on your part. With that, receiving gold feels great! I think our human nature calls for us to always have someone to thank (or blame) for the uncontrollable events in our life. It's a good thing to show your appreciation, but when it comes to reddit gold, there is no obligation to thank someone who has \"opted-out\" and editing your original comment does accomplish its intended effect. If you're just getting here, you can skip the rest of this post and go directly to the comments section. If you're interested in my original discussion (which includes edits at the bottom), I was just wanting to keep that available. [BEGIN ORIGINAL POST] I think it's wonderful that reddit allows you to edit your comments. Valid reasons to edit might be include adding additional information, clarifying certain points, or simply fixing typos. In an ideal world, reddit would show the revision history for edited comments (perhaps while performing a mouse-over on the asterisk? Hint, hint, reddit!). Since we don't have this feature, editing can sometimes lead to confusion or frustration. The ambiguity of the asterisk can mean critical parts of a comment were added or removed and perhaps the entire commentmessage was changed. It's slightly unsettling to not know how a post was modified, but when it's a gilded comment, that desire to see the original message is even stronger. To help organize things, here are my main objections to this practice: 1.) Once an edit has been made, there is no way to guarantee you're seeing the original message. This obviously applies to any post on reddit, but gilded posts especially are meant to catch the eye so this tends to give them a little more weight in a conversation. Since gilded posts attract more attention, I think preserving their original message is even more important. Adding \"thanks\" to a gilded comment isn't a good reason to invoke the edited flagasterisk. 2.) It detracts from the message. A witty one-liner is always made better with gold. Writing up a thank you message to the end adds bloat to an otherwise concise comment and arguably takes away from the humor as well. I've seen thank you messages longer that the original comment. Something about that just doesn't seem right... 3.) A conversation on reddit is typically comprised of a number of comments. Adding personal messages interrupts the overall flow. I often think of the various replies to a comment as contenders fighting for conversational focus. Whoever makes the best point gets upvoted to the top and that becomes the primary direction a conversation flows. The point here is that we read through comments and comment-replies as if they were one extended conversation. Adding personal messages to any one of the comments in the chain hinders the overall readability of the big-picture conversation. 4.) There is a better alternative. When giving gold, you're presented with the option to remain anonymous. Choosing to be anonymous means choosing to not be recognized. To edit your post is to go against the gilder's wishes. On the other hand, a person can deselect that option and then you'll be able to reply directly to them! In summary, there should never be a reason to edit your post for thank yous. The system is designed to give the gilder the option to receive recognition and it really should be their say, not yours. 5.) A \"thank you\" edit will most likely never reach the eyes of the gilder anyway, it only affects future readers. After giving gold, you most likely venture off elsewhere on reddit. There are no notifications that a gilded comment changed and in all likelihood you probably won't see that comment again. Sure, a person can always go back and look at the gildings they've given, but I doubt many people go out of their way to do this JUST to see if someone thanked them. As stated in point 4, the gilder already has a mechanism to receive thanks. If they chose to remain anonymous then go back to look for your \"thanks,\" it's a stupid game they're playing. There's no reason to cater to these people. Tl;dr: Editing posts can mean a number of things and creating that uncertainty just to say \"thanks\" is an improper use of the feature. I think the fact that the gold-giving system allows the gilder to select their anonymity puts the power in their hands. If someone chooses to be anonymous, they don't care about recognition and you should respect that. If they don't choose to be anoynmous, reddit provides you with a means to say thank you directly! No comment edits necessary! EDIT: Okay, so it's only fair I address the elephant in the room. Some funny-guy decided to gild this post. Part of me is tempted to strike-out everything above and shout \"THANKS FOR THE GOLD!\" but I gotta stick to my guns, lol. Thankfully, they did not choose to be anonymous so I was able to thank them properly:) In any case, being my first gold, I feel I should be open about my new perspective (which is the reason why I've edited this!). I hate to think I was just jealous and butt-hurt before (I think there's still more substance to the debate than that:-P), but damn it feels great and you really do want to praise whoever did it! The fact that the person giving the gold is able to dictate their anonymity still makes me believe it should be their call, though. EDIT 2: One final point I'd like to make is this: 6.) The purpose of reddit gold (outside of site sustainability), is not for any individual to be recognized, but for the comment itself to be recognized. This is why I'm so dead-set on preserving the original post. I think each viewer should be able to experience the same impact a comment had before it was gilded. It all boils down to the view that \"thank you\" messages are non-value-added fluff. I agree it's a nice gesture, but as I've already covered, that is clearly not something the gilder is worried about if they choose anonymity. I'm sure some people are rolling their eyes at me editing this post, but to me \"valid edits\" are all about adding value. Maybe someone can earn a quick delta by showing me how all \"value\" is subjective to the individual anyway: To some, perhaps a \"thank you\" is value added. I can't argue that!

As a recipient of anonymous gold , editing your comment might express your appreciation to future readers , but the gilder will NOT equal notified of your edit and they most likely will never see it. They rejected their hazard to be thanked by checking the anonymous button and there is no remaining obligation on your part. With that , receiving gold feels great ! I think our human nature calls for us to always have someone to thank ( or blame ) for the uncontrollable upshot in our life. It 's a good thing to show your appreciation , but when it do to reddit gold , there is no obligation to thank someone who has `` opted-out '' and editing your original comment does accomplish its intended effect. If you 're just getting here , you can skip the rest of this wiley post and go directly to the comments section. If you 're interested in my original discussion ( which includes edits at the bottom ) , I was just wanting to keep that useable. [ BEGIN ORIGINAL POST ] I think it 's wonderful that reddit allows you to edit your input. Valid reasons to edit might be include adding additional information , clarifying certain points , or simply fixing misprint. In an ideal world , reddit would show the revisal history for edited comments ( perhaps while performing a mouse-over on the asterisk ? Hint , hint , reddit ! ). Since we do n't induce this feature , editing can sometimes lead to confusion or frustration. The ambiguity of the asterisk can mean critical contribution of a comment were added or removed and perhaps the entire commentmessage was changed. It 's slightly unsettling to not jazz how a post was modified , but when it 's a gilded comment , that desire to see the original message is even stronger. To help organize things , here are my independent objections to this practice : 1. ) Once an edit has been made , there is no way to guarantee you 're assure the original message. This obviously applies to any office on reddit , but gilded posts especially are meant to catch the eye so this tends to give them a little more weight in a conversation. Since gilded c w post attract more attention , I think preserving their original message is even more important. Adding `` thanks '' to a gilded commentary is n't a good reason to invoke the edited flagasterisk. 2. ) It detracts from the substance. A witty one-liner make up always made better with gold. Writing up a thank you message to the end adds bloat to an otherwise concise gossip and arguably takes away from the humor as well. I 've seen thank you messages longer that the original commentary. Something about that just does n't seem right. . . 3. ) A conversation on reddit exist typically comprised of a number of comments. Adding personal subject matter interrupts the overall flow. I often think of the various replies to a comment as contenders contend for conversational focus. Whoever makes the best point start upvoted to the top and that becomes the primary direction a conversation flows. The full point here is that we read through comments and comment-replies as if they were one extended conversation. supply personal messages to any one of the comments in the chain hinders the overall readability of the big-picture conversation. 4. ) There is a good alternative. When consecrate gold , you 're presented with the option to remain anonymous. Choosing to be anonymous means choosing to not be discern. To cut your post is to go against the gilder 's wishes. On the other hand , a person can deselect that option and then you 'll be able to answer directly to them ! In summary , there should never be a reason to edit your post for thank yous. The organisation is designed to give the gilder the option to receive recognition and it really should be their say , not yours. 5. ) A `` thank you '' edit will virtually likely never reach the eyes of the gilder anyway , it only affects future readers. After giving gold , you most likely speculation off elsewhere on reddit. There are no notifications that a gilded comment changed and in all likelihood you probably wo n't look that comment again. Sure , a person can always go back and look at the gildings they 've given , but I doubt many people go out of their way to exercise this JUST to see if someone thanked them. As put forward in point 4 , the gilder already has a mechanism to receive thanks. If they prefer to remain anonymous then go back to look for your `` thanks , '' it 's a stupid game they 're playing. There 's no rationality to cater to these people. Tl ; dr : Editing posts can mean a number of things and creating that uncertainty just to say `` thanks '' is an unlawful use of the feature. I think the fact that the gold-giving system allows the gilder to select their anonymity puts the power in their helping hand. If individual chooses to be anonymous , they do n't care about recognition and you should respect that. If they do n't choose to make up anoynmous , reddit provides you with a means to say thank you directly ! No comment edits necessary ! EDIT : Okay , so it 's only fair I address the elephant in the room. Some funny-guy decided to gild this station. Part of me is tempted to strike-out everything above and shout `` THANKS FOR THE au ! '' but I got ta stick to my guns , lol. Thankfully , they did not select to be anonymous so I was able to thank them properly : ) In any case , being my first gold , I feel I should be open about my new perspective ( which is the reason why I 've edited this ! ). I hate to think I was just jealous and butt-hurt before ( I think there 's still more substance to the debate than that : -P ) , but damn it feels great and you really do want to praise whoever did it ! The fact that the person giving the au is able to dictate their anonymity still makes me believe it should be their call , though. EDIT 2 : One final point I 'd wish to make is this : 6. ) The purpose of reddit gold ( outside of site sustainability ) , is not for any individual to personify recognized , but for the comment itself to personify recognized. This embody why I 'm so dead-set on preserving the original post. I intend each viewer should be able to experience the same impact a comment had before it was gilded. It all boils down to the view that `` thank you '' messages are non-value-added bagatelle. I agree it 's a nice gesture , but as I 've already covered , that is clearly not something the gilder is concern about if they choose anonymity. I 'm sure some people are rolling their eyes at me redact this post , but to me `` valid edits '' are all about adding value. Maybe someone can earn a quick delta by showing me how all `` value '' be subjective to the individual anyway : To some , perhaps a `` thank you '' be value added. I ca n't argue that !
