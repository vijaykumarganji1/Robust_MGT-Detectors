I had a horrible math class; the kind where the numbers just dance around inside your head and laugh at you, and some asshat had stolen my copy of Great Expectations. So, I was of course, sitting in one of the Coffee Shoppe's many comfortable chairs, sipping a rather amazing chai tea latte. The chai tea latte had a napkin-wrap around it, and a no-spill lid that I had made myself, to protect the glorious illustrations on Great Expectations.

Transporting the entire population of the Earth-2 to another planet and setting up a colony would be extremely troublesome. Not a lot of humans survived the demolition of Earth-1, but even with the small starting population, humanity had multiplied, \"like rabbits\" as they used to say decades ago. Earth-2 now had millions of people, and bustling metropolises. More than the cost involved in transport, finding a new planet was an issue. Many were reluctant to take in humans, as we were known to destroy ecosystems at alarming rates and were also way behind in the technology race (we developed crude improbability drives just a year ago, while advanced versions are common in most other planet systems). Improbability drive travel has also been regulated fairly strictly, ever since the antics of former president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox caused everyone so much trouble. So we decided to use an improbability system to drive the asteroid away from its collision course with our planet. We needed to build a massive improbability reserve and use it to deflect it. Unfortunately for us, our improbability systems are crude, and can only harness a certain kind of it. Just like matter and antimatter, there exists luck and antiluck, and our drives can only use luck. Back when we didn't have the drives, luck and antiluck affected life equally. But since luck-antiluck symmetry is a fundamental law of the universe, using our drive meant that it dissipated the extra anti-luck out into the world. Today, each citizen is expected to slip on two banana peels a day to consume some of the antiluck, so that we won't have to deal with cancer epidemics and natural disasters. Banana prices have shot up to astronomical levels and potassium deficiency is unheard of. Children and the elderly are required to wear special protective suits, as they are vulnerable.

Her long black hair was messy and oily, and her eyes were filled with malice. \"Glad to see I'm not the only one feeling like death...\" I grumbled while stepping into the shower. I earned the unearthly groan from her. 100. You might think its weird to be naked in front of Death.

The rest of him was similarly toned. In his giant hands was a piece of paper yet uncrumpled. His small eyes focused on it in concentration. Polly, or Pestilence, sat across from him. She looked like a rather beautiful looking surgery addict from Bay Watch. Pamela Anderson be damned. Puffy pink lips, oversized chest, large hair, and a bronzed plastic-like complexion. Her eyes were focused squarely on the chessboard. A hand pushed forward a bishop of the same plastic she was mostly made of. Her finger lingered on it while her lips puckered. It lifted from it and she grinned smugly. War grumbled, but not at the game. The paper in his hands became crumpled. He set it gently next to him and retrieved another. He glanced at the game and pushed a pawn forward. \"Damn it\" Polly swore with a flop back in her seat. Her hair bounced as she slumped and pouted. \"666 to 13?\" I inquired. \"666 to 15!\" Polly whined adamantly. War rolled his eyes and relaxed his buging muscles. The white tee was now clearly visible, and the text \"Free hugs\" written in crude handwriting could be seen. \"Here ya go plumb,\" Fam said as a plate of rotten eggs, rancid bacon, withered grapes and a pile of perfectly cooked spam. \"Where's D?\" I asked while poking the spam. \"Early release in Japan...\" Polly said while still pouting. \"Oh?

Many of his friends had already found out their talents and it was just like he'd been told throughout his time in school and by his parents: \"Your 18th birthday will define your future.\" Grant had become a strengther, destined to assist in hard labour, military or emergency service roles. Keith had become a kinetic, adept in manipulating the position of small objects in space with precision using only his mind; a talent that had become well-suited to surgeons, scientists and - when working with teams of kinetics - construction and controlled demolition. Sandra had been unlucky. Sandra's talent had been a rare one. She had the gift of invulnerability. Governments across the world had agreed to share their invulnerables in the largest joint-nation experiment in history - human rights conventions easily sidestepped by newly written laws that came swiftly in the aftermath of'the event' nearly 50 years ago. In those 50 years there were no statistics for how many invulnerables there bad been or how successful these experiments were. Sandra was picked up the day after her 18th birthday. The joint-governments had set up an efficient task force that detected the unusual electro-magnetic activity associated with invulnerables during their change.

Simons palms sweated as he looked into his father's eyes with an overwhelming mix of excitement and fear. 20 seconds. His mother took his hand \"It's going to be ok. We're here for you.\" she assured him. 10 seconds. Simon felt a creeping sensation tingling from the base of his spine slowly climbing to the top of his neck. 10:34. His eyes lit up furiously with a crimson red that made his own mother recoil a few steps back. His whole body shook violently and he crumbled to the floor seizing. He had heard of the pain experienced during the change but nothing could have prepared him for the razorblades inside his head and the fire in his veins. 10:44. His parents were sitting on the floor next to him. They held each others hands and looked visibly shaken. Simons eyes opened. He felt strong, like waking up feeling well after having been ill. His father was first to speak \"Are you ok? \" , Simon nodded. \"That was the most violent change I've ever seen.\" His father continued \"Are you sure you're alright?.\" Simon found his voice \"I'm fine, honestly,\" \"how do I find out my talent?.\" \"You've got ta try it dear,\" his mother said quietly. Simon stood up with his parents. He felt lighter. As if he'd never exerted so little energy to stand up. His thoughts felt quicker. As if he'd been operating in low gear his whole life. Simon effortlessly lifted the piano in the dining room. \"I'm a strengther!.\" \"Thank god!\" his mother squeaked. \"Like father like son.\" his father quipped. Simon was giddy. He told his parents that he had to go and show his friends, they laughed and let him on his way. Not 20 minutes later he was at the park with Keith and Grant. Grant was spinning a roundabout close to breaking point while Keith carefully arced a swing back and forth. \"Simon! What did you get man!? What's your talent?\" Grant shouted as Simon approached the roundabout. \"Strengther\" he said, as he easily brought Grants self-experimentation with the roundabout to a halt. Grant wrestled the opposite side of the roundabout with Simon but it did not budge. \"That's awesome, how are you finding it? Keith asked calmly, still more focused on his swing than on the competition with the roundabout. \"Yeah, so far so good,\" Simon admitted \"It's a little strange though.\" \"Feels sudden doesn't it.\" Grant stated more than asked, giving up and stepping back from the roundabout. \"Yeah,\" Simon agreed \"It does.\" It was at this point that he had noticed Keith struggling to control his swing, as if battling with an unknown force. Simon looked around and saw no one nearby. He looked back and Keith had regained control, visibly annoyed at himself. Tests for kinetic surgeons were among the most gruelling of any job. The three friends played around with their talents for the rest of the afternoon, Keith flicking up objects in the air for Grant and Simon to smash between each other. On his way home Simon tripped over and landed beside a broken bottle. It wasn't till he'd stood up and walked a few yards that he realised his hand had a shard embedded deep. Maybe strengthers feel less pain than others he thought, absent mindedly pulling the shard from his hand and covering the gash with his jumper sleeve as he continued the walk home. When he came in the door, Emma ran up and hugged him \"Missed you Sai-mawn!\" she was still struggling with her pronunciations. A large meal had been prepared and a few particularly nice drinks were chosen to \"break you into the world of alcohol nicely\" as his father had put it. They laughed and joked about how worried they'd been about the change and Simon felt a little closer to adulthood as he shared a beer with his father. As he brushed his teeth and got ready for bed he realised that there was no blood on the jumper from his cut hand. He looked down and turned white as a sheet. His hand was completely fine. There was no sign of the gash the glass had left after being deeply jammed in not a few hours ago.

Keith asked calmly , still more focused on his swing than on the competition with the roundabout. `` Yeah , so far so honest , '' Simon admitted `` It 's a little strange though. `` `` Feels sudden arrange n't it. `` Grant stated more than postulate , giving up and stepping back from the roundabout. `` Yeah , '' Simon gibe `` It does. `` It was at this point that he had noticed Keith scramble to control his swing , as if battling with an unknown force. Simon looked around and saw no one nearby. He looked back and Keith take in regained control , visibly annoyed at himself. Tests for kinetic surgeons were among the most gruelling of any task. The three friends played around with their talents for the rest of the good afternoon , Keith flicking up objects in the air for Grant and Simon to smash between each other. On his way home Simon trigger off over and landed beside a broken bottle. It was n't till he 'd suffer up and walked a few yards that he realised his hand had a shard embedded deep. Maybe strengthers feel less pain than others he thought , absent mindedly pulling the sherd from his hand and covering the gash with his jumper sleeve as he continued the walk home. When he came in the door , Emma ran up and hugged him `` Missed you Sai-mawn ! '' she was stock still struggling with her pronunciations. A large meal had been get up and a few particularly nice drinks were chosen to `` break you into the world of alcohol nicely '' as his father had put it. They laugh and joked about how worried they 'd been about the change and Simon felt a little closer to adulthood as he shared a beer with his father. As he brushed his teeth and got ready for bed he realised that there was no line of descent on the jumper from his cut hand. He looked down and turned white as a piece of paper. His hand be completely fine. There was no sign of the gash the spyglass had left after being deeply jammed in not a few hours ago. They would total for him tomorrow. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "In the Amazon lives a tribe of men with no concept of time. They have no history, oral, written, or drawn no stories of the past or hopes for the future. They call themselves the Hi'aiti'ihi: \"the straight ones.\" And they hide a great secret. The sun burned high in the sky, as brilliantly as it had the last time John and Fiona had coasted down the river, fifty years ago. It glared at them imperiously, its eye a smoldering blister in the clear blue day. It didn't care. For the sun, this day was as plain as the last and as uncertain as the next. It blazed without worry, that it might live forever. Fiona wiped a slick of sweat from her brow, leaving her forearm uncomfortably damp and sticky. As inescapable as the heat was, the humidity was such that she was forever covered in a miserable, sweaty dew even during the night, when some of the day's feverish warmth had receded. She peered over the side of the canoe, wondering for a moment whether she'd be drier if she were in the water. \"Are you okay, love?\" John's voice sounded hoarse and phlegmy. The heat never treated him well. He cleared the catarrh from his throat and placed a pallid hand upon her shoulder. \"We're nearly there.\" Fiona laid her hand atop John's and massaged it. How quickly his skin had changed. What once was the soft fragility of infancy had eventually become this, had given way to leathery senility. The idea was revolting, though John was not. \"I wish you hadn't made a habit of smoking,\" Fiona said, catching John out the corner of her eye. \"Then we wouldn't be here so soon.\" \"Sorry.\" John's body shook as he fought to hold in a cough. \"It seemed like it might be fun: smoking without the consequences.\" He grinned, and it was the same shit-eating grin that Fiona had fallen in love with. A smile that could stir the heart of a stone. \"And it isn't as though we wouldn't have had to come soon, anyway. I'm sixty-five. Hell, you're fifty!\" \"Let's just make sure we don't go through this scare again.\" Fiona squeezed John's hand and let go. \"Okay, I promise.\" \"Mister John,\" the man at the paddle said, \"Is that the place, over there?\" \"Yes,\" John called back. \"There should be a man waiting.\" He scanned the shore for a few moments, searching. \"Ah, there he is!\" There was always a man waiting, watching, keeping guard. His treasure was well-hidden, but even still, it was more precious than any other thing on earth. Fiona wondered whether the Hi'aiti'ihi knew this. Perhaps their desire to guard the fountain was an atavistic instinct from long ago. It was even possible that the little man at the shore wasn't a guard at all. Maybe he was just there. He was always there. The guide brought the canoe to the shore with no fuss, using the current to gently guide the small boat and bring it parallel to the bank. The vertebrae in the small of Fiona's back cracked pleasantly as she rose. She held her hand out for John, who took it with a shaky grip. The little guard waved at them enthusiastically. \"I'll be back soon,\" Fiona told the guide. The spry man hopped from the the canoe and began to make it fast to the trunk of a leaning tree. \"Fiona,\" the guard pointed. Fiona nodded and smiled. The last time he'd seen her, she'd been an infant. The guard grinned ear to ear, revealing a row of perfect white teeth. \"John?\" \"Yup,\" John wheezed. He had just risen from the canoe, and he was already out of breath. Fiona that she saw a frown hiding behind his murky green eyes. \"Come, come!\" The guard gestured. It was a miracle that he had remembered the few English words they had taught him all of those years ago. But the little guard was an amazing man; he was the man who had saved Fiona's life. And for him, perhaps miracles were but the foundation of his every day. Should it have been strange that he looked younger today than he had fifty years ago, when a fifteen year-old John had cradled Fiona's frail frame in his spindly arms? \"Fountain?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" Fiona said. She pressed John's rough hand tightly between her own. \"Come, come,\" the man repeated. \"Fiona,\" John began. There was a catch in his voice, so he began again. \"Fiona, I don't know.\" She looked back at him. What was it? The furrow of his brow spoke of more pain than his pride would allow him to express. Had it really taken him this far, the cancer? \"What don't you know, John?\" \"I love you,\" John said. \"I've loved you longer than any man has ever loved a woman. Six hundred years ago, Fiona. Six hundred years ago, I came here with you. To save you.\" \"John, stop.\" Fiona wanted to shout, but it was only a whisper. The guard watched, curious. Whether the man could make out what John was saying mattered little to Fiona. \"Please, let's get you to the fountain.\" \"I've wondered this entire time,\" John said. \"Was I really saving you, or was I saving myself?\" \"You were saving both of us.\" There were tears in her eyes, then. Hot tears. God damn the heat. God damn it. She pulled at his arm, but the sixty-five year-old John was strong for his age, as he had been at fifteen. He wouldn't budge. She clawed at his chest, grabbed his shoulders, his neck. \"Fiona, I only ever wanted to save you. I want you to be able to live for yourself. Remember Etienne? What about Herrara? I can't make you stay with me forever. You shouldn't have to.\" \"John, you were a child when I met both of them. That isn't fair!\" \"It isn't? You know what isn't fair? We've cheated death for nearly six hundred years! Everything we are is unfair to everyone, everywhere else. And I'm dying, Fiona. I'm dying, and I've never felt this close to the end. It's stupid, saying this, but there's something about it that feels right.\" John shook his hand free, stood straight as a soldier. He was a soldier, after all, wasn't he? Fiona's favorite soldier. A great conqueror. He smiled: that shit-eating grin. There was a sad confidence there, behind his watering eyes. \"Why now?\" Fiona wondered. \"When we're so far, John. Why?\" \"I'm sorry,\" John shrugged. \"It's hard to see the truth before you come to face it. I've thought about this for years, and I knew the moment you pulled me from that canoe, that I would not be carried back.\" \"Stay with me,\" Fiona plead, her own voice sounded as if it came from other end of a very long tunnel. \"I'll always stay with you,\" John said. And he turned and sprang from the forest with the stride of a vivacious young man. One last time. Then Fiona's world was all water: the sweat on her forehead, the tears trailing down her face, the lump in her throat, and the sound loud as thunder of her husband diving into the river, plunging beneath. A tremor coursed through her body. She wanted to shout, but the air. It was too goddamn muggy, too hot. She collapsed to her knees, looked up, at the sun gaping through the forest canopy. Through her tears, it appeared brighter. The guard placed a hand on the small of her neck. He'd never known death, had he? Had he known love? \"Okay,\" the guard spoke warmly. He placed a soft finger beneath Fiona's chin and turned her head to look him in the eyes. \"Fountain?\"", "text_perturb": "In the Amazon lives a tribe of men with no concept of metre. They have no history , oral , drop a line , or drawn no stories of the past or hopes for the future. They call themselves the Hi'aiti'ihi : `` the true ones. `` And they hide a great mystery. The sun burned high in the sky , as brilliantly as it had the last time John and Fiona had coasted down the river ,  years ago. It glare at them imperiously , its eye a smoldering blister in the clear blue day. It perform n't care. For the sun , this day was as plain as the terminal and as uncertain as the next. It blazed without worry , that it might live eternally. Fiona wiped a glossy of sweat from her brow , leaving her forearm uncomfortably damp and sticky. As inescapable as the heat cost , the humidity cost such that she cost forever covered in a miserable , sweaty dew even during the night , when some of the day 's feverish warmth had receded. She peered over the side of the canoe , wondering for a moment whether she 'd equal drier if she were in the water. `` Are you okay , love ? '' John 's representative sounded hoarse and phlegmy. The heating system never treated him well. He cleared the catarrh from his throat and placed a pallid manus upon her shoulder. `` We 're nearly there. `` Fiona laid her hand atop toilet 's and massaged it. How quickly his skin had changed. What once was the soft fragility of infancy had eventually turn this , had given way to leathery senility. The idea live revolting , though John live not. `` I wish you had n't made a habit of smoking , '' Fiona said , catching John out the corner of her middle. `` and then we would n't be here so soon. `` `` Sorry. `` John 's body shook as he fought to have got in a cough. `` It seemed like it might equal fun : smoking without the consequences. `` He grinned , and it was the same shit-eating grin that Fiona had fallen in honey with. A grin that could stir the heart of a stone. `` And it is n't as though we would n't feature had to come soon , anyway. I 'm sixty-five. Hell , you 're fifty ! '' `` Let 's just make sure we do n't fail through this scare again. `` Fiona squeezed John 's hand and let run low. `` Okay , I assure. `` `` Mister John , '' the man at the boat paddle said , `` Is that the place , over there ? '' `` Yes , '' John called back. `` There should be a humankind waiting. `` He read the shore for a few moments , searching. `` Ah , there he is ! '' There was always a man waiting , watching , keeping precaution. His treasure was well-hidden , but even still , it was more precious than any other thing on worldly concern. Fiona wondered whether the Hi'aiti'ihi knew this. Perhaps their desire to guard the fountain was an throwback instinct from long ago. It was even possible that the little man at the shoring was n't a guard at all. Maybe he was scarce there. He was forever there. The templet brought the canoe to the shore with no fuss , using the current to gently guide the small boat and bring it parallel to the bank. The vertebrae in the small of Fiona 's back crock up pleasantly as she rose. She apply her hand out for John , who took it with a shaky grip. The petty guard waved at them enthusiastically. `` I 'll be back soon , '' Fiona recount the guide. The spry man hopped from the the canoe and began to hit it fast to the trunk of a leaning tree. `` Fiona , '' the sentry duty pointed. Fiona nodded and smile. The last time he 'd figure her , she 'd been an infant. The guard grin ear to ear , revealing a row of perfect white teeth. `` bathroom ? '' `` Yup , '' bathroom wheezed. He had just stand up from the canoe , and he was already out of breath. Fiona that she saw a frown hiding behind his murky green eye. `` Come , come ! '' The sentry duty gestured. It was a miracle that he had remembered the few English words they had teach him all of those years ago. But the little guard was an amazing man ; he was the man who had hold open Fiona 's life. And for him , perhaps miracles were but the foundation of his every twenty four hours. Should it have constitute strange that he looked younger today than he had fifty years ago , when a fifteen year-old John had cradled Fiona 's frail frame in his spindly arms ? `` Fountain ? '' he asked. `` Yes , '' Fiona sound out. She pressed John 's approximate hand tightly between her own. `` Come , add up , '' the man repeated. `` Fiona , '' king john began. There comprise a catch in his voice , so he began again. `` Fiona , I execute n't know. `` She looked backward at him. What was it ? The furrow of his brow spoke of more pain than his pride would allow him to verbalise. Had it really taken him this far , the cancer ? `` What do n't you know , John ? '' `` I fuck you , '' John said. `` I 've loved you longer than any man has ever so loved a woman. Six hundred age ago , Fiona. Six hundred years ago , I derive here with you. To pull through you. `` `` lav , stop. `` Fiona wanted to shout , but it follow only a whisper. The guard watched , rummy. Whether the man could make out what John was pronounce mattered little to Fiona. `` Please , let 's get you to the outflow. `` `` I 've wondered this entire time , '' John enunciate. `` Was I really make unnecessary you , or was I make unnecessary myself ? '' `` You were make unnecessary both of us. `` There represent tears in her eyes , then. Hot tears. deity damn the heat. God maledict it. She pulled at his arm , but the sixty-five year-old John was strong for his age , as he had been at xv. He would n't agitate. She clawed at his chest , grabbed his shoulders , his neck opening. `` Fiona , I only ever wanted to save you. I require you to be able to live for yourself. Remember Etienne ? What about Herrara ? I ca n't make you ride out with me forever. You should n't hold to. `` `` John , you were a child when I foregather both of them. That constitute n't fair ! '' `` It constitute n't ? You know what constitute n't fair ? We 've cheated death for nearly six hundred years ! Everything we are constitute unfair to everyone , everywhere else. And I 'm perish , Fiona.

Fiona 's preferred soldier. A great vanquisher. He smiled : that shit-eating grin. There was a sad confidence there , behind his watering heart. `` Why at present ? '' Fiona wondered. `` When we 're so far , John. Why ? '' `` I 'm sad , '' John shrugged. `` It 's toilsome to see the truth before you come to face it.

{"original_text": "It had been a little over 7 hours since the lander touched down on Martian soil. 7 hours ago, half the world watched as we, the pioneers of a new age of space exploration, entered Martian orbit and slowly began preparations to touch down. The moment the gear hit the dirt, celebrations broke out everywhere on Earth. Actually, I suppose they wouldn't have celebrated until a few minutes after we touched down due to the signal delay. Oh well, close enough. Now, things are pretty damn quiet here in Acidalia Planitia. But now the celebrations were over. We'd spent months getting here, years training, and taxpayers had given millions of their hard earned dollars to this project. It was time to get down to business. We'd spent the last few hours setting up gear here, including our habitation, complete with all the basic comforts of Earth: breathable air, water, and atmospheric pressure. Also, space food, but that's nothing to write home about. We had just finished setting up the rovers and other toys. We were understandably quite tired of building stuff, so we decided to go for a rip about in the rovers; for \"testing\" purposes, of course. It was me and Winters in the lead rover, and Commander Smith, a stern but effective leader and career airwoman, and Richthofen, the German, in the utility rover. I, of course, had dibs on the lead rover - had since take off. We decided to head a little north of the landing site, explore the plain a little. Acidalia Planitia was an ideal landing site, very flat and very easy to set up camp in. Perfect for a first test of our Mars exploration technologies. As we drove merrily along, Winters, the flight engineer, spotted something in the distance. \"Mike, you see that? Up ahead, about half a click...\" \"Yeah yeah, Winters, save me the damned analysis. Commander, you have eyes on this?\" \"Affirmative. Let's get a closer look. Dismount here,\" the Commander radioed. The rovers skidded to a halt. \"What could this be, out here? Supposed to be flat for miles,\" remarked Richthofen. \"Well, it certainly ain't a fuckin' tree, Richthofen,\" I shot back. \"Easy there, Johnny Carson,\" the Commander replied sternly, as we came within a few feet of the object. As we studied the mysterious anomaly, each of us grew dead quiet. \"It's a flag,\" Winters said, finally breaking the eerie silence. \"And certainly not one of ours,\" began the Commander. The tattered Soviet banner flew defiantly in front of the astronauts, as if taunting them for being so late to the party. It was riddled with holes, the once vibrant, blood red colour was no bleached, and the hammer and sickle were now barely visible, but it was still a damn fine looking flag. \"Mike, photograph this. Richthofen, Winters, you two have a look around the perimeter. I have to report this to Control.\" \"Uh..... Houston, we have a problem. You know those little green men you were worried about? Yeah, turns out they're Russians,\" I said snakily. \"Commander, you trying to give those guys a heart attack?\" \"Shut up and shoot photos, Mike,\" ordered the Commander. I started snapping pictures of the flag, of the site, and the soil around it. Standard procedure. May or may not have thrown in a selfie with the flag for good measure, because fuck it. What're they gon na do, fire me? In space? Nah, after months spent in a tin can, I was ready to have a little fun. I was just tucking the camera back into the rover when Winters' voice called out. \"Commander! Might want to have a look at this!\" We walked over to where Winters and Richthofen were standing. Strewn around them was what appeared to be aircraft debris, most of it covered with a few inches of soil, with only the horribly warped edges protruding. \"Look here, Commander. Got a red star on it, I think. Russian, no doubt about it,\" observed Winters. Richthofen was studying a rather large piece of metal. His pale, stormy blue eyes were highly inquisitive, his gaze deep. He was observing the debris with Teutonic efficiency. \"When my father worked for the Soviet space program..... before the wall fell..... he worked on pieces just like this. I remember him bringing small pieces home, tinkering with them, showing them to me and my sister. These are Soviet rocket parts. I have no doubt.\" Winters was also studying the pieces. \"There's junk just like this all over the place. Too much to just be left behind space junk. I think, based on the state of some of these pieces,\" he paused to pick up a rather large steel plate, marked with another red star, \"that there was an explosion of some kind. See here..... badly warped from the inside. Based on the shape, I'd say this came from a piece of the booster from the lander.\" \"Collect some of this junk and load it into the rovers. We need to bring some to the Hab for further analysis,\" ordered the Commander. I'll spare you the details of this rather boring interlude. Long story short, we picked up a nice assortment of crap from the dirt, loaded into the rover, and left that ugly flag flying. Commanders' insistence. Something about \"honouring our brothers who came before us.\" Eh, I hate communism as much as the next guy, but if I got blown up a million miles away from Earth, I'd want to be remembered to. When we got back, we suited down, had some food, and generally chilled out until the commander decided to hold court. \"I just got off the radio with NASA,\" began the Commander. \"Told them what we found. As per NASA rules, this all goes public in 48 hours. Russians don't seem to know anything.\" \"Bullshit,\" I said. \"Think about it, Young. The Russians would have told us if they knew about this. They would have known we would find it, so there would be no use in hiding it.\" \"The Soviets, they have many secrets,\" stated Richthofen, in a solemn voice, \"that died with them.\" \"Well, I've been thinking,\" said Winters. \"And I for one think this all makes perfect sense.\" \"Oh? Do tell,\" prompted the Commander. \"Well, you all know of Yuri Gagarin, I presume?\" The room nodded affirmatively. \"Yes, well, when he went up for the first ever human spaceflight, no one except the government and the Soviet space agency knew about it until after he took off, floated around in space a bit, and landed safely. The Soviets didn't want the U.S. to know how close they were to winning the Space Race in case shit hit the fan. Only after it was a success did they make it public. Better for propaganda, that way.\" \"And for scaring the living shit out of the U.S.\" I cut in. \"Precisely.\" The Commander looked puzzled. \"So, what you're saying is, the Soviets won the Space Race. Made it to Mars, the whole thing. But when it came time to go home, everything went wrong.\" \"So to save face, they covered up the entire project. But, why? They still won the damn Space Race,\" I chimed in, as thoroughly puzzled as everyone else. \"Perhaps,\" began Richthofen, \"they thought they could try again. Get it right, this time. But then, the Americans put a man on the moon, and they didn't want to bother..... how do you say it? To \"one-up\" the United States. Probably took the technology and used it for the ICBM program instead.\" \"I'm just amazed this never came out, even twenty-five years after the collapse,\" the Commander said thoughtfully. \"You'd be surprised,\" began Richthofen. \"They could make people disappear in the night, never to be seen again. I doubt they'd've had any trouble burning a few documents and swearing some scientists to secrecy.\" The Hab grew eerily silent as we all considered the gravity of our discovery. This could literally rewrite the history of human space travel. It was sobering. Ever the sarcastic joker, however, I just had to have the last laugh, to lighten up the now very somber mood in the Hab. \"And here I was thinking I'd get a statue here one day.

{"original_text": "Magic is pretty prevalent where I'm from. There are a couple of different types, and I'm not really read up on how they all work, but I'll try to explain them. Most prominent is blue magic. Blue mages are typically either elementalists or conjurers, and my sister Eleanor is the latter. She took fencing classes in college, so she uses her magic to compress the mana in the air into the solid form of a rapier. Her daughter Marie practices both fencing and kendo, but she can't use magic. Personally, I think it's because she's a latent Silver mage, like her father was. See, Silver mages generate power within their bodies, unlike other kinds who have to pull it from the environment. It manifests as a silver flame, and what it does varies immensely from one person to the next. But someone can't learn Silver magic, they have to be born as a Silver mage. And in the same way, Silver mages are incapable of performing any other kind of magic. It's become something of a rarity these days, because about 17 years ago, a cataclysmic event wiped out almost all of the silver mages, and the ones who survived went into hiding. This event was caused by a man named Louis Tucker, founder and CEO of a corporation dedicated to protecting people from rogue Silver mages. Tucker, along with a coworker by the name of Nicholas Calhoun, were both White mages posing as Silvers. To be honest, I didn't even know White magic existed before Tucker and I had a..... disagreement. Long story short, Nick ended up losing his life attempting to stop Tucker, and ultimately failed.

I wouldn't admit it then, but my human instincts caught up with my thoughts that moment, as I saw my friend walking across the room. Dyed hair, half blonde, half strawberry red, waving in the air. The mere presence of her being, her curvaceous body gracefully gliding through the air, the smooth shape of her illustrious body, it was the only temple that any man could really truly be loyal to.

While we might spoil ourselves by choosing temporary utility in joining in a contract with another human being for life, what does it provide? More life? Nay, it provides more chaos to an already tumultuous environment. Marriage. That institution is not sacred. It is a mere thought, a blink in our life. People that are consumed in the \"essence\" of this institution are only deluding themselves for the glory of mankind. The only truth that they fail to accept, inherently, is the consequences that arise from this dreadful bond. The heartbreak, the suffering, the pouring rain over a parade, a thunder strike igniting a fire, a wave toppling a ship. All of these experiences epitomize the true nature of marriage. Thus, we reach the quintessential problem. What is the meaning of life? Biologically speaking, it is to reproduce. However, it is known that 99 of all species that have ever existed have become extinct. Our species will be no exception to that cardinal rule. As a species, we are so brash to think ourselves important on this speck of sand in the infinite universe. We can not amount to anything, being one of millions of human beings.

{"original_text": "Oh, those two. Sorry, I thought you meant the ones with the bicycle. There's a bit of a story there. Not an altogether pleasant one, if you want my opinion. Like so many of the other ones here, there's not really a moral to it. It's more a pathology. Well, alright. I can tell by the way you're looking at me I'm going to have to tell it. Ugh, it's sooo cheap, though, of a story, just as horrid as all the other ones here, but - I think we're better off getting to the next room. No? Okay. Fine. The tall one. Well, the one on the ground. With his back to the ground. The one with hair. He's a rapist and a muderer. Not a big one, comparatively to some of the usual suspects around here. Three rapes, I think, the murder was somewhat incidental. It happens, sometimes, you know, with the rape and all. But criminals, they get caught, and he did. It's a pity, I suppose, that he didn't get caught for any of the crimes he commit. But you know how it goes, \"well, m'lord, he's prolly guilty of sometin',\" and the next thing you know it's to the chair or the gallows or whatever it was then. I'm not keen on chronology. Actually, I'm embarrassed. I think I was trying to do a Tennessee accent there. Don't tell, will you? Good. Anywho, in the process of committing this injustice against the guilty comes the other one. The bald one. Bound and determined to bring his wife's attacker to justice. Or at least someone to it. Mind you, baldy is a curious one in his own right. List of venial sins that runs a marathon, but only one mortal one, sort of, when he perjured himself to try and convict the one he's wrestling with. If he perjured himself, that is, I've seen much more narrow cases run the other way. He was so desperate to believe that he could catch his wife's assailant, felt so emasculated by the situation, blamed himself so much for being so drunk after the poker game, that, well, I'm willing to cut him some slack. But the drama begins when, before the mob strings him to the tree, or maybe it's soundlessly mouthed on the other side of the thick glass: whatever it is, the bald man says to the tall man, \"I'll see you in hell.\" Not an uncommon thing to say, mind you, and there are certainly exculpating circumstances. But he says it. And he believes it. He believes it, in fact, with the sort of belief that he hasn't displayed over any other teaching of the Good Lord. It's a promise to him. It destroys him. It consumes him. Not overtly. He doesn't descend into anguish and alcohol or whatever. He remains married to his wife, for a time. Then divorces her and takes up with another, for a time. He is respected and feared at his job. But a promise like that, it's a sort of spark, right? If you don't actively quench the fire, it keeps burning. So, the rapist, unrightfully condemned but justly punished. He's a bad man, a bad, bad man, but he's nowhere near the worst of men, and it may be that is greater sin is being too impressionable. He suffers, and he learns his penance. He'd be to Lethe by now. Except for the other man, the husband, out to make good on a promise he didn't know the price of. Oh, we can't let the rapist go when the husband wants to make him his punishment. We simply can't. That wouldn't be fair to anyone. And the husband - and this is what makes the story so tawdry from my point of view - he keeps wanting something different out of the rapist. He wants to forgive him. Then he wants his forgiveness. Then he wants to fight. Then he wants to be rid of him. But he can't get over the idea that he's somehow not his lodestone, that he's a person in his own right. Meanwhile, the rapist, well, he doesn't really understand, in part because he's moved beyond his moral self, but also in part because he's being held to task for a crime that he didn't commit. However similar to ones he did. The husband, as things in hell goes, is positively moving backwards. The most piteous quality of the story, I suppose, is that the wife languishes in purgatory, unawares of this whole drama being played out for her purported benefit, and I've not the faintest if the actual perpetrator is even passed on to the Beyond. Frankly, the whole caboose stinks of cheap melodrama. Which isn't hell's thing. So you see why I didn't want to have to tell you about it?", "text_perturb": "Oh , those two. Sorry , I thought you think of the ones with the bicycle. There 's a minute of a story there. Not an altogether pleasant one , if you want my notion. Like so many of the other single here , there 's not really a moral to it. It 's more a pathology. Well , alright. I can severalise by the way you 're looking at me I 'm going to have to severalise it. Ugh , it 's sooo cheap , though , of a story , just equally horrid as all the other ones here , but - I think we 're better off getting to the next room. No ? okay. fine. The tall i. intimately , the one on the ground. With his spine to the ground. The single with hair. He 's a rapist and a muderer. Not a big one , comparatively to some of the usual suspects around hither. Three rapes , I think , the murder was moderately incidental. It find , sometimes , you know , with the rape and all. But criminals , they buzz off caught , and he did. It 's a commiseration , I suppose , that he did n't get caught for any of the crimes he commit. But you know how it goes , `` well , m'lord , he 's prolly guilty of sometin ' , '' and the next thing you know it 's to the chair or the gallows or whatever it be then. I 'm not lament on chronology. really , I 'm embarrassed. I think I was trying to do a Tennessee accent at that place. Do n't tell , will you ? expert. Anywho , in the process of committing this injustice against the guilty come in the other one. The bald one. Bound and determined to wreak his wife 's attacker to justice. Or at least somebody to it. Mind you , baldy is a curious one in his ain right. List of venial sins that runs a marathon , but only one mortal one , sort of , when he perjured himself to prove and convict the one he 's wrestling with. If he perjured himself , that is , I 've seen much more minute cases run the other way. He was so desperate to believe that he could catch his wife 's assailant , felt so emasculate by the situation , blamed himself so much for being so drunk after the poker game , that , well , I 'm willing to cut him some slack. But the dramatic play begins when , before the mob strings him to the tree , or maybe it 's soundlessly mouthed on the other side of the thick glass : whatever it is , the bald man says to the tall man , `` I 'll see you in hell. `` Not an rare thing to say , mind you , and there are certainly exculpating circumstances. But he enjoin it. And he think it. He believes it , in fact , with the kind of belief that he has n't displayed over any other teaching of the Good Lord. It 's a hope to him. It destruct him. It devour him. Not overtly. He does n't descend into anguish and inebriant or whatever. He remains married to his married woman , for a time. Then divorces her and takes up with another , for a sentence. He is respected and feared at his caper. But a promise like that , it 's a sort of spark , justly ? If you do n't actively quench the fire , it keeps burning. So , the rapist , unrightfully condemned but justly punished. He 's a bad man , a bad , bad man , but he 's nowhere near the unsound of men , and it may be that is greater sin is being too impressionable. He suffers , and he learns his self abasement. He 'd be to Lethe by forthwith. Except for the other man , the husband , out to make good on a promise he did n't love the price of. Oh , we ca n't let the rapist go when the husband want to make him his punishment. We only ca n't. That would n't be fair to anyone. And the husband - and this is what makes the story so tawdry from my point of view - he restrain wanting something different out of the rapist. He want to forgive him. Then he wants his pardon. Then he wants to fight back. Then he wants to constitute rid of him. But he ca n't develop over the idea that he 's somehow not his lodestone , that he 's a person in his own right. Meanwhile , the rapist , well , he does n't really understand , in part because he 's moved beyond his moral self , but also in part because he 's being held to task for a criminal offence that he did n't commit. However similar to ones he set. The husband , as things in hell goes , represent positively moving backwards. The most piteous quality of the story , I suppose , is that the wife languishes in purgatory , unawares of this whole drama follow played out for her purported benefit , and I 've not the faintest if the actual perpetrator is even passed on to the Beyond.

{"original_text": "The Bane of Kings, the Harbinger of Death himself, has returned. Some thought him a myth, merely a legend to entertain children, but now the tales have proven to be much more than lore. Only the Chosen One, a man with the body of flesh but the soul of magic, can stop him. But alas, this man is no brave warrior. Alas, this man is no staunch mage. Alas, this man is no cunning knave. This man knows one trade, one way: the Way of the Drunkard. Talbjorn, a man of about thirty, has lived in my village for many years. Nobody knows where he came from, but he stumbled into town with an arrow in the calf some years ago and has since remained. He doesn't speak much, nor does he act much, only wastes his days traversing this sleepy village. Some days he looks to work the forge, others he hunts for pelts, but most days he simply drinks. His wound has left him a near cripple, a noticeable gimp in his walk, and his poor routine has not done wonders for his health. Since his arrival, he's gone from a dashing young man with the strength of ten men to an obese sycophant who can barely carry his own weight. While many, including he, seem to think him a wounded animal, an old horse than can no longer pull his cart, I know better. I have studied him on his hunts, seen his expert marksmanship and proficiency with an ax against all manner of nature's worst, and yet he has stayed in this sleep village among the common rabble rather than continuing his adventures. While it may not seem like it, this laziness and gluttony will lead to the world's demise. With the return of the Great Harbinger, the world as we know it will not be safe until the Chosen One can slay him. This is why I must get this man back on his feet and into action, out questing and gallivanting across the plains and tundras and in shape to face such a foe. I must convince him to leave this village and out on the path to his destiny, before it is too late. Why have I not told him this? I am a chicken. No, not afraid, for I am of the noblest, wisest and boldest of my kind; I am a literal chicken. I laid and nested for years, watching this once great warrior as he crumbled into but a husky shadow of his former self, until one day opportunity struck and I hatched an idea. Wolves. A whole pack of the dastards came bolting into town. There were no guards, for the village was too small and isolated for such luxuries, and so the townspeople are left to defend for themselves. The local men and women took up arms against the feral beasts, but alas, these villagers were no warriors. As the casualties grew, Talbjorn awoke from his slumber and let instinct take over. He drew his bow and put down a wolf with a single shot before emptying his quiver into several others. When he ran out of arrows, the newly able warrior grabbed an ax from a fallen villager, ironically the barkeep who'd served him ale for years, and went headfirst into the pack swinging away. I watched as the warrior cut them down with savage blows. While he was powerful, Talbjorn has not as much of a finesse player with his ax as he was with his bow. On multiple occasions, he nearly struck down an ally with his berserk blows. This was my chance. I had always been one of the noblest and fairest of chickens, my feathers never ruffled and my peak always clean.

I was loved and respected by all, despite my status as a mere bird, yet I always knew I was destined for something greater. Perhaps I was the Chosen One as well. I flew, not literally of course, into the heat of battle. As Talbjorn swung his ax downward in an attempt to behead one of the final wolves, I intercepted. Instead, his red wet blade met my tender breasts. As I felt his ax crush my frail body and my life fade out, I knew I had won. I had done my duty. I watched from the Heavens as the village went into shock. Their prized bird had just been slain in cold blood, indeed a crime most fowl.

It had been around for a long time, and used medicinally up until the people realized it's potential to ruin someone's life in the eighteen hundreds. There are four active chemicals that we know of that alter the brain chemistry. We're not entirely sure of how it happens, and how addictive it is. My friend's name is John. He used to be my suite mate in college. John could destroy at super smash bros. This one time, we got wasted on alcohol, and we played smash bros for seven hours. He won nearly every round. He called fox his \"main.\" I never knew he was depressed. Some days he would hole himself up in his room, playing pink floyd and crying. The walls were very thin and the music wasn't as loud as he thought. But I'm not one to pry into the personal life of someone. I forgot about his problems, though, and things carried on as normal. We tried shrooms on a mountain hike during a lazy weeekend, and watched the trees bend and shimmer, only to forget there were trees in the forest at all. After our trip, we headed back to my car and just sat there. John turned to me. His eyes were a dull grey I could only find in a cloudy day or in true sadness. His pupils bent in and showed forever. \"I hate myself. I hate myself so much and I don't know what I'm going to do in the next few weeks.\" I didn't understand his cry for help until John's depression reached a peak in our third quarter when John attempted to commit suicide. He was placed on a watchlist, and spent the following three days uneasily recovering in a hospital. After that, he had to talk with two doctors regularly. He talked about his feelings with a psychologist, and he talked about his brain with a psychiatrist. Two days after he started therapy, he was prescribed a new anti-psychotic that had just been put on the market. This drug had been contested for decades. In the 1970's there were panels to discuss its legality, and protests to abolish it from the market completely. While it does relieve a lot of depression symptoms, it also makes the user sluggish, and forgetful. It drains them of their motivation, and messes with their circadian rhythm. They have no energy. John was happy. But he wasn't John, anymore. I recently got back in contact with John after he took a quarter off of college to get more of his life back together. He told me he took a job as a fry cook. He said it was hard finding a job that would allow him to medicate while working, but the fast food industry seemed indifferent about the mental status of their employees. I spent the night with him at his apartment. I asked if he wanted to drop acid, and he said he was content with his anti-depressional drug. I was concerned. This drug couldn't possibly be safe to use regularly like alcohol or adderal. He was probably addicted by this point. We sat down on his grungy couch which creaked when more than one person sat on it, and he turned on his gamecube to play some smash bros. For the first time ever, I beat him at his best. It wasn't even close. He was sluggish. He was laughing the entire time as I pulled combo after combo. He had once been the undisputed king of smash bros in our group, and now here he was. Content with failure. Happy to live under the bar. Excited to get beaten time and time again. It was sickening. I set the controller down and I stood up. \"John. Marijuana is ruining your life. You are clearly addicted, and you need professional help.\" John looked up, eyes redder than the surface of mars. His face mimicked the tone of his confused expression. \"What?\" I looked at the fast food wrappers and pizza boxes. \"This whole addiction. You're slower, and you're less fun. You were better when you were normal, you know. We could go on a hike and stare at the trees. We could go to a party and dance. But you have been holed in your room, just smoking weed and..\" My voice wavered. \"It's not you, John.

When he finally understood what I had said, he gave a slight chuckle. The chuckle turned to uproarious laughter. He was nearly sobbing in fits. He looked up to me and said with no hints of sarcasm of jokingness, \"You are so full of shit, bro.\" Promptly after he said this, he keeled over and died.

{"original_text": "\"Good morning Mr. Pokelton.\" A nurse walked by in a hurry as Mr. Pokelton rummaged through the busy hallway. A large oblong case swung back and forth at his side while he pranced to room two-four-eight. Stopping momentarily to get his barrings in this foreign space he spun around to find the newest pretty face. \"Miss, miss could you tell me where this room, two-four-eight, is?\" Inquired the dabber man still shimmying his oblong case back and forth to a hidden beat. \"Just down this hall to the left, there are the elevators, second floor, take a right coming out, and then one more right at the first hallway, it'll be on the left.\" The nurse took off towards a nearby room after dealing with the man with an uncanny plan in a hallway foreign to his unique jam. Mr. Pokelton shrugged off the busy-body ways of the nurses of hospital Happier Days and moved down the hall to the left. Sure enough there stood an elevator that would take Mr. Pokelton to the second floor where he'd find his room, two-four-eight. He pressed up and waited, swaying in the way of many a passerby until the doors opened and a fine lady caught his eye. Not a nurse but some young daughter or mother visiting a sickly patient no doubt but she stared back at our Mr. Pokelton curious about his oblong case. He just smiled back and tipped his hat walking into the elevator to see his own family or friend in the room just above called two-four-eight. \"What's your The doors closed on the young lady as Mr. Pokelton frowned at her delayed reaction to their obvious attraction, she only left one word in the elevator to be heard. name.\" Mr. Pokelton bounced on one knee and shook off his encounter determined to regain the composure before he found her. A dull music crossed against his beat, but it not lost he bounced on his two feet and waited. The doors slowly opened and he rushed through to the second floor his journey almost complete. A young man called \"Mr. Pokelton!\" from down the hall but he took a swift right and before he knew it Mr. Pokelton was out of sight so he frowned looking down at his soles. The young man was Jeremy a saint of the hospital of Happier Days, who brought joy to all the patients he visited. He'd known Mr. Pokelton for a few years now and always enjoyed listening to his sweet old scowl, and stayed ever curious about his seemingly magical ways. Mr. Pokelton on the other hand didn't hear poor Jeremy, in fact on the contrary he was quite determined about arriving at this room two-four-eight. He stepped to it through the hall counting down and standing tall wondering where exactly this room was suppose to be. Two-three-two, two-three-six, two-three-nine. Now that's just a crime. two-four-four, two-four-six, two-four-eight! He let out a long drawn sigh finally happy to have arrived opening the door to peak inside for his beat was on the rise. And there lied a man, sickly and ill. Lying alone in a bed ever so still. Mr. Pokelton strolled up to the bed of the man. He set down his oblong shaped case and popped open the latch on either side. Up went the ceiling to reveal a delightful violin, gleaming of the finest wood you'd ever seen. Now truth be told it was a cheap old violin, but Mr. Pokelton would be quite cross if you said. No, he picked it up right out of it's case, with some sheet music at no great haste, looking down at the sickly man's eyes full of dread. There was a soft change in the wind as Mr. Pokelton began to play. A kind of essence filled the room with warmth and light as the world blurred into his silky smooth melody. The old man perked up, his face filled with color as he looked at Mr. Pokelton, his violin in hand, his eyes closed, lips shivering. \"Who are you?\" Asked the man. \"Mr. Pokelton of course, I'm hear to play a tune for you because truth be told you're going to die soon.\" \"Die?\" The old man said with a fright, concerned now by the stranger at his bed playing a song and filling his head. \"What kind of person barges into a room and just says a man is going to die! I'll have you know I'm on chemo and the cancer hasn't effected me in days.\" \"Dyin' ain't so bad it's like a dream opening up at the seam, you drift off into a darkness sure but sometimes my friend there isn't any cure.\" Mr. Pokelton's violin seduced the old man and he felt calmer as each note passed by. He wondered why he had to die, couldn't he live just for tomorrow? What if something happens, something crazy, even if he was a little hazy. Is it so wrong to dream of living forever, seeing the stars for once with loved ones together? \"Now, now.\" Mr. Pokelton interjected into the thoughts the old man had selected. \"Tomorrow is a happier day I wont lie to you, and you know it to be true. However, you must see that we all drink one last cup of tea. I'm here for one simple reason, you're not ready to pass away this season. I felt it in my heart and so I came to reconcile your fear with my art.\" The old man frowned at the preposterous situation but the song held him close to the words of Mr. Pokelton's preoccupation. Death was a horrid subject they both knew, but everyone must discuss it soon. \"I lived such a long live, so many children died before me. If I could give some years to them I guess I would. To let them see just one more day, that's honorable right? To explore just one more place, that's generous? But you know Mr. Pokelton I fear and fear the darkness, it comes for us all and I just wish something would illuminate the way.\" The old man stood still in his bed as he looked at Mr. Pokelton. Mr. Pokelton smiled back, knowing the troubles of the old man in his final hour, but certain he'd help him stop the final cower. \"Fear is fear and you should feel it too. There is no rhyme or reason to stop you. At the end of the day though I'm sorry to say that the darkness envelopes every ray. It's a dark fact indeed but just remember what happens to that lonely seed. It's not much consideration for those taken too soon or with ample trepidation but for this old oak I think it'll do.\" The old man smiled at Mr. Pokelton.

If it were something so simple I would be elated, but it's not, it's a hell of a lot worse. I have been a very successful, yet underpaid and underappreciated, secretary for quite some time now. One of the perks of this job is all of the mind numbing errands that I have to run. It allows me to leave the office quite frequently. If I happen to take a little longer, or even leave to run a fictitious errand no one seems to notice these things. It's wonderful, I have things to do. Well, I thought no one was noticing these extra outings for my extracurricular activities. On my usual stop in the break room to pour myself a much-needed cup of the miracle of life, in walks in my unremarkable coworker Lettie. As I'm savoring the first sip of my coffee, my eyes are closed to allow its full affect to properly sink in. That's when I hear this conspiratorial little whisper, \" I know what you are. \" My eyes fly open after that statement because I know Lettie and I are the only two people to be in this break room. Even though my heart is pounding in my chest, and I've by passed the beading of sweat to a straight on pool of it on my back. I shrug with carefully calculated amount of nonchalance, and with a surprisingly steady voice say, \" Thanks, Lettie, I'm really glad someone around here notices what a kick ass secretary I am! \" Lettie sniffs, as she rolls her eyes. She steps closer and lowers her voice further talking slowly like she might scare me off. \" No, not that. I know what you really are. The real reason why it takes so long to... \" \" Run errands? \" \" Exactly, that's because... \" \" The lines are so damn long and traffic is awful? \" \" No! \" By this point Lettie is so close I can taste the tuna that she had for lunch. Her breath is coming out in little pants, and her eyes are taking on a glassy sheen. I feel this conversation heading from bad to worse, and I am using everything I can to derail it, but the damn train won't tip over. I am backed into a literal corner by the coffee pot and fridge, and she is angling her body to be as close to mine without ever touching. When in one of her funny little gasps of breaths she gets out, \" I know you're a super hero, dammit! \" That's when I lose it. I let out a howl of laughter so loud, a few people poke their heads into the break room. They see our proximity, take in my gales of laughter, put two and two together, and high tail it out of there. Desperately trying to reign in this unusual outburst of mine, I manage to squeeze out, \" I am not. \" I have never seen a human being turn such a vivid red before, but unremarkable Lettie turned out to be pretty damned remarkable at flushing in frustration. Huffing, she stomps out. Collecting myself I follow out a few minutes later. Things are getting out of hand. I haven't been able to get any work done thanks to being hounded by Lettie, and things are starting to escalate. In the first week or two it was just glares, and pointed looks. Week three I would get random emails, stating things like \" I KNOW! \" Please, if she really knew she wouldn't be this obsessive. Around the time of week four, I would see her around my favorite lunch places. She always acted like it was an accident that we bumped into each other, but it became obvious when it was an everyday occurrence. After a week of these so-called bump ins I decided it was time to talk. My nerves were wearing thin, and my plans were falling behind. Lunch hour was a big deal for me, I strongly believed in a working lunch. I decided to lay in wait in the back of my go to vegan sub shop, I mean I have to have some morals, and sure enough in comes Lettie thinking she is the model of a stealthy spy. I watch her get in line, and poorly try to unobtrusively scan the shop. While her head is turned the other direction, I grab her arm yanking her toward the back exit. She yelps, and starts to dig in her heels, her trout mouth opening to scream. It takes her a moment to realize that it's me and she swallows the screams, and walks willing into the alley. She yanks her arm out of my hand, and starts rubbing at the sore spot. No, I wasn't gentle. I am frustrated. She glares at me trying to arrange her face into what she thinks is a combination of angry and authoritative. I see behind that pathetic front. Her eyes have that glassy sheen again, her breathes are starting to pick up into little pants, and she slightly shifts her body towards mine. \" What do you want, \" she says while trying to sound annoyed. I hear the excitement however; she has been waiting for me to catch her. \" Look Lettie, \" I say in soft tones while my hands are balled up in my pockets, I'm trying not to strangle her. \" You need to stop this. I don't know what I've done, but I am not what you think I am. \" I watch as her eyes take on a look of a wild desperate hope, her arm reaches towards me like I might be the one thing that can make everything better. This look does not cause a normal reaction within me, the one where you go to a person and try to comfort them. Instead I feel my nails gouging little crescent moons into the palms of my hands, the urge to strangle her has gotten stronger. Standing in that dark and foul smelling alley way instead of going with my instinct, I watch as Lettie curl her arms around herself and a haunted look comes over her face. Fucking great. I've been plagued by this bitch for weeks, which puts me behind on my work, but now I have to listen to a pity story? Great, just fucking great. I'm genuinely surprised when instead of getting the whole my family was slaughtered speech, I hear, \" I just want to help you, in any way I can. Please, I just need to be more than a fan I need to do something mean something. \" She curls further in on herself, and I watch the as the darkness of the alley swallows her up. Gently I say, \" I'm just not who you think I am, \" as I walk past her. It took about a week or so for inspiration to hit, but I'm happy to say during that week Lettie was blissfully absent. I knew that it was just a temporary measure, so I was delighted when I figured out a solution to my problem. I did some research on Lettie, which was easy, because I am a whiz when it comes to research. Lettie was a loner orphan, parents died tragically. You know, all the boring details that makes someone like her want to gravitate towards those do-gooder super heroes. If I was a super hero I would hold her, and comfort her and make rainbows and unicorns appear. I would give her cookies and avenge her parents and things like that. Luckily for me, and as I told her repeatedly, I am not a super hero. The benefits of her being an orphan loser are advantageous for quite another reason. I planned, and triple checked to make sure that everything would be sail smoothly. After one mundane day at the office I pulled Lettie aside in the break room, when I knew no one would be around to use it. Elated doesn't even begin to describe this high that I was feeling. I played it off as nervousness, shifting from foot to foot, my eyes darting around. She picked up on the energy I was putting out, her eyes taking on their familiar glassiness. \" I knew it, \" she said with a quite squeal and a little fist bump in the air. \" I need you to help me. \" \" I knew you would. \" \" No, one could ever know. \" \" I know that. \" \" What I do is to important for anyone to find out about. \" \" So I can't leave any evidence of helping you? \" \" Exactly. \" \" What do you need me to do? \" I had her walk to my lab, doubling and tripling back to leave any cameras or potential witnesses confused. She left her purse and phone at home, her suggestion, not mine. She shows up out of breath and glowing with excitement at what she thinks is my secret lair. She is right. It is my secret lair, just not the kind that she is thinking of. I let her in, and I watch her as she takes in the place. It's brightly lit from the florescent lighting; the air is sharp with antiseptic. My excitement is building at the same rate that comprehension is dawning on her. She turns and stares at me in in horror, and my face is leering in anticipation. As she fills her lungs to scream the needle has already been injected into her neck, the anesthetic working fast. Lettie starts to fall, but I catch her. I don't need my test subject damaged. Lettie was slow to wake from the clutches of the drug, and even slower to put the pieces together of what was happening to her. Now, she lays there on the table the straps cutting into her, tears streaming, she looks up at me begging silently. \" What's the matter Lettie, \" I said as I pat her cheek and move to fiddle with the tubing sticking out of her. My voice drops as a crouch next to her head and whisper in her ear, \" I thought you wanted to help me. That's what you said, you said you were my fan and you would do anything. \" I watch as Lettie struggles, her eyes growing wider as the horror is starting to fully set in. I love this part really, as the adrenaline kicks in, fight or flight, goes wild, and they are just stuck. I stroke Lettie's hair, letting my fingers twist through her muddy brown strands. \" Really I should be thanking you, if you hadn't become so nosey, I wouldn't have had this opportunity for this test phase, it's really going to let me see the kinks before I put it to real use. I really never knew that having fans would be so handy. \" Lettie screams are muffled through the cloth gag, and that wonderful shiny purple serum makes its way through the tubes and enters her body. I watch her body slowly start to shudder as it enters her blood stream, and finally she starts full on convulsions. I let out a sigh, and let a slow grin spread across my face.

All around him the halls of Industry, of Progress for Destruction's Sake, rang empty. Torches flickered in their wall sockets, dancing flames laid low by the sigh of the wind. Somewhere, a postern door creaked open. As metal screeched against stone, for a brief, quickening moment Sauron thought he heard the pitter-patter of small, harry, Hobbit feet. Fiery images and sweet, distant screams, echoed through his mind - piles and piles of diminutive skeletons - and Sauron was reminded, once again, that the Glory Days were over. All he had left were memories, and an old, constantly whispering ring that seemed to be incapable of shutting up. \"Master Skreevil the Pretty scampered into his view, his ruddy snout split in two by some old battle. How the orcs come up with these ridiculous names..... \"Master, we've found him. The last of Man. We've gutted him clean and his skin was strung up to dry. This is the dawn of the age of the ORC!\" Skreevil slammed a fist to his chest, and uttered a whooping howl. Sauron shrugged his mailed shoulders, not bothering to lift his head. \"That's fine, Skreevil.\" \"Master?\" Skreevil ducked and weaved in that pathetically timid way the smaller orcs do, as if Sauron might smash his tiny skull into pieces at any moment, \"Master, is something wrong?\" \"Have you ever heard the song of the Valar, Skreevil?\" \"Is that the one by Barbish the Blood-mouthed?\" \"No, no,\" Sauron's wistful tones were low, monotonous, as if inflection itself was too difficult - or too pointless a task, \"It does not matter. It is not a song you will ever hear, because they are all dead. Just like the elves. And the hobbits. And the ents...\" \"The dwarves,\" Skreevil sniveled helpfully. \"Truly?\" Sauron was lifted briefly out of his stupor by a longing pang in his chest, \"When did they go?\" \"Last century, my lord. You always said they'd end up killing themselves.\" \"Pity. I should have liked A thought struck Sauron like an arrow through an eye-socket. Skreevil cocked his head at his master, fidgeting. When Sauron sat up in his throne, Skreevil automatically threw his hands in front of his face, and squealed. Yet the smashing did not come. Skreevil uncovered his face. Sauron was staring down at him, twin kindlings of fire glowing behind his mask. Sauron had his left hand - the hand with the ring - cupped to his ear, and was nodding along as if someone was whispering to him. At last, Sauron's voice broke the silence: \"Skreevil, how would you like to be a general?\" \"A general...\" slowly, a wicked grin spread over Skreevil's face - until a thunderbolt of confusion split his thoughts, \"But, my lord, what armies would I command?

He put out his hands, and gripped Skreevil by his shoulders, until Skreevil winced in pain, \"That's why this is the perfect time to strike!\" \"Strike- who- my lord Skreevil tried to shrink away from Sauron's grip. \"The Goblins, Skreevil.

Sometimes, I wish I had just let those poor little hobbits throw it into the fire.\" \" But it has worms in it! \" Sauron the Mighty, the First and Last Emperor of Middle-Earth, was arguing with an Orc. Sauron wedged himself into the open door, so the orc could not see around Sauron's sizable frame. Gorzog Stinkbreath, who unfortunately lived up to his name, was clever for an orc. That's why he was made Chef - anyone can kill, but it takes true talent to cook. At least, that's what he told himself..... \"Worms is good for you, my lord. Full of vitamins and juicy nutriments,\" Gorzog demonstrated his point by pulling a worm out of the wriggling, infested bread, and dropping it down his gullet. Sauron, covered his nose with one hand and shuddered. \"I do not want it,\" his voice was muffled by his armored fingers. \"But \"Gorzog, I am busy. I do not want it. I am trying to - I am very busy. Leave me alone!\" Sauron slammed the door in Gorzog's face. The door, a massive, metal thing, with spikes at the top and the bottom, cracked against the stone frame so hard that one of its hinges broke. The door swung itself open (well, to be honest, Gorzog might've helped it swing open by kicking at the hinges a few times, but Orcs were rarely honest, so - the door swung itself open). Gorzog was assaulted with a barrage of awful, foul-smelling odors: baking apples and cinnamon, acrid-yet-pleasant pipe weeds, and were those..... flowers? Before he could stop himself, the question tumbled out of his mouth, \"My lord, what are you doing in \"Out!\" Sauron shrieked, his long cape fluttering behind him, \"Get out of my workshop, right now! Don't you orcs ever KNOCK?! \" But it was too late. Gorzog had seen. \"Is those cups filled with ale?\" \"No. \" \"Yes, they is. And that's pipe weed, right? Why is there curly hairs all over the floor?\" \"It's not hair, it's- it's \"You're making Hobbits, isn't you!\" There was a whiff of air, and the door slapped shut behind Gorzog. Sauron swept towards him, one accusing finger jutting out of a mailed fist - aimed directly at Gorzog's face. \"Look, you Sauron lowered his gaze to Gorzog, and started coughing (what on Middle-Earth has this Orc been eating?), \"You don't spill a word of what you saw in here, Gorzog. Not a word. \" \"But Master, we killed all the Hobbits. We torched their inns, and we buried them in their own holes. Why do you want to bring them back?\" \"I don't want to bring them back!\" Sauron snapped. He pressed his fingers to his temples, and sighed, \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell at you Gorzog. It's the food, it's the music, it's- it's- oh, you wouldn't understand.\" Inwardly, Gorzog agreed with that, but he valued his life. He looked at Lord Sauron, and for the first time he noticed the cotton sticking out of the ear-holes in Sauron's mask. Noting Gorzog's gaze, Sauron plucked, almost guiltily, at the cotton, \"What? This? This was the only way I could get that damned ring out of my head. Kill this, destroy that, betray them - I'm sick of it! SICK.\" \"Of course, my lord,\" Gorzog backed away. Gorzog thought Sauron was right - he was sick, but it was the kind of sickness that made you worry. If an Orc was sick like this, well, the Medicine Orcs usually prescribed a brutal, painful death. Gorzog had to tell someone. Sauron bent over his table, clutching at the weeds, and letting the Old Toby crumble through his mailed fist, \"I miss the grass, Gorzog. I miss the flowers, and the way the leaves sound when the wind rushes through them Flowers? Next he'll be talking about forgiveness, and love, and other menfolk things. \"Uh huh,\" Gorzog nodded, humoring the Dark Lord as he slowly backed out of the room. \"Have you ever heard the Song of the Valar, Gorzog? Gorzog had one hand on the door. He had hoped to escape without the Master's notice. The question hung in the air, unanswered. \"Gorzog...\" Sauron's voice was a deep, metallic growl, \"You're not leaving, are you?\" \"Ah,\" he said, slowly. Perhaps the Dark Lord hadn't changed so much after all. Gorzog fumbled with the broken hinge, scrambling to pull open the might door. He planted his feet on the stone floor, and heaved and heaved and- Sauron's mace crashed down on his skull with a ringing WHUNK. \"I could've had an army of Hobbits,\" the Ruler of Middle-Earth muttered to himself.", "text_perturb": "Sauron the Necromancer , Ruler of all Middle-Earth , rested his chin on his fist , and blew air contrive his nose.

This is the dawn of the age of the ORC ! '' Skreevil slammed a clenched fist to his chest , and uttered a whooping howl. Sauron shrugged his mail clad shoulders , not bothering to lift his head. `` That 's fine , Skreevil. `` `` Master ? '' Skreevil ducked and weaved in that pathetically timid way the smaller orcs do , as if Sauron might smash his tiny skull into pieces at any import , `` Master , is something wrong ? '' `` Have you ever heard the song of the Valar , Skreevil ? '' `` Is that the one by Barbish the Blood-mouthed ? '' `` No , no , '' Sauron 's wistful tones were low , monotonous , as if inflection itself was too difficult - or too pointless a task , `` It does not matter. It is not a song you will ever hear , because they follow all dead. Just like the pixie. And the hobbit. And the ents. . . `` `` The gnome , '' Skreevil sniveled helpfully. `` Truly ? '' Sauron was lifted briefly out of his stupor by a longing pang in his chest , `` When did they go ? '' `` Last one c , my lord. You always said they 'd stop up killing themselves. `` `` pity. I should let liked A thought struck Sauron like an arrow through an eye-socket. Skreevil cocked his head at his master , fidget. When Sauron sat up in his commode , Skreevil automatically threw his hands in front of his face , and squealed. Yet the smashing did not derive. Skreevil uncovered his nerve. Sauron was staring down at him , twin kindlings of flame glowing behind his mask. Sauron had his left hand - the hand with the ring - cupped to his ear , and was nodding along as if somebody was whispering to him. At last , Sauron 's voice interrupt the silence : `` Skreevil , how would you like to be a general ? '' `` A general. . . `` slowly , a wicked grin spread over Skreevil 's face - until a thunderbolt of confusion split his thought process , `` But , my lord , what armies would I command ? We are at peace ! '' `` For now , yes. That 's exactly what we want them to think Sauron stood at his full summit. He put out his hands , and gripped Skreevil by his shoulders , until Skreevil winced in infliction , `` That 's why this is the perfect time to strike !

{"original_text": "Rob opened his eyes and shot upright in his bed. Then a mischievous grin spread across his face. Rob was always special, ever since he was a young boy he could sense things, he could avoid trips, falls and other accidents. It was at his eighteenth birthday, however, that Rob sensed his own death. He was due a party, a surprise party, which he already knew about because he sensed everything. He also sensed that attending his party meant his own death. On his way home some delinquent would stab him over petty change. This was averted by simply not attending. His time had run out, and he had sensed Death, hovering persistently at his heels like a puppy dog. Everything Death tried to throw at Rob, he had avoided. This continued for several years until Death apparently threw in the towel and had disappeared. Now something else was here, Rob could sense it. But not only that, Death had manifested himself personally to Rob earlier that night and told him to prepare for visitors! \"I've almost lost my job because of you!\" Death barked angrily, pointing an accusing finger at Rob. \"Do you know how difficult it is to find a decent job in hell these days with this economy?!\" Rob shrugged his shoulders impassively. Trying to stifle the grin that was persistently trying to spread across his face. Death waited for an answer, after a few minutes of awkward silence Death brought his boney hand to his skull, which was obscured by the long draping hood of his cloak. \"Y'know what! I quit!\" Death threw his scythe to the ground like an infant throwing a teddy after not getting his own way. \"I hear McDonald's are recruiting.\" Rob jeered and he burst into a fit of laughter. \"You will be visited by three demons.\" Death said with a defeated sigh. \"Silence, Loneliness and Darkness.\" Death chuckled to himself, it was a dry chuckle devoid of any humour. \"Good luck!\" He said sarcastically, before disappearing into a cloud of mist. Now Rob sat awake in bed, grinning with anticipation as Death's threats came to fruition. In the corner of the room stood a woman, she wore a white dress and her long black hair was matted in thick clumps that draped across her pale face like curtains. She was unusually thin and quite tall. Rob didn't need an introduction, he could already sense the demon was Silence. What worried him, albeit only slightly, was the fact he hadn't sensed her arrive. \"Ah! Silence! I didn't hear you come in! Can I get you anything? Tea? Coffee?\" Silence shook her head. Rob energetically jumped out of bed and turned his bedside lamp on. He couldn't sense any weaknesses he could exploit. He could however sense that if he screamed, she would drag him to hell. He turned to face her. Her lips were stitched shut and her eyes were like two icey pools of water, they regarded him coldly with a murderous gleam. She held in her boney fingers a rolled up parchment, which she presented to Rob. 'Dearest Robert Fairbrook. I understand that you have somehow avoided Death for an unprecedented amount of years and I would like to express both my congratulations and commiserations for accomplishing such a feat. This charismatic young lady is called Silence, the more placid of my trinity of sorrow. Take her hand and come willingly or I will be forced to invite Darkness and Loneliness to this party. And those two make Silence seem like a pussy cat. Sincerely your pal, Satan.' Rob kissed his teeth and screwed the parchment up into a small ball and tossed it into the corner of the room. \"Sorry but no deal.\" Silence didn't seem pleased by his refusal to comply. She grabbed his shoulder, her tight, contorted, decaying flesh creaked as she outstretched her arm. Her grip was ice cold on his bare shoulder. \"Wait!\" Rob yelled. She recoiled at the pitch of his yell and released her grip, provoking a devilish grin from Rob's lips that reminded her of her master. \"Oh that's right! Silence, you hate noise. I'll tell you what lady, if you can beat me at a game of cards I'll come quietly, if not, you'll have to drag me out of this world how I came into it.\" He paused for dramatic effect. \"Kicking and screaming. Either way I'll be coming with you, deal?\" Silence nodded reluctantly. Snap was the game of choice, and of course, being Silence by name and Silence by nature the demon lost the game because of her inability to yell the important phrase when she wanted to call snap. \"I win.\" Rob sighed. \"It's a hollow victory though. I don't particularly have the energy to kick and scream.\" He walked over to the kitchen side, resting his hand on the handle of a kitchen knife resting on the draining board. He turned his head and as he predicted, Silence was stood directly behind him, her eyes now shone bright red and her hair flailed around wildly independently as if it was a separate being. Perfect. Rob sensed exactly how far he needed to slash with the knife to cut the stitches holding her lips together. Then he brought his foot down on her bare foot with all the strength he had. \"OW! MY FOOT!\" Silence yelled in agony. \"I win.\" Rob uttered coldly. Silence screamed as light shone from her eyes and mouth and she was banished back to hell. One down, two to go. The second demon appeared exactly an hour later. His very presence radiated sorrow and misery that made Rob feel like he didn't even want to live any more. He resisted as much as he could and sat up in bed to face Loneliness. Loneliness was a terrible sight to behold, his skin was blue and his eyes were permanently frozen wide open, his mouth was stretched open far beyond the limits of the human jaw. He looked sad, and Rob almost felt sorry for him. \"I don't even want to be here anymore.\" Loneliness cooed in an emotionless voice. His mouth didn't move as he spoke. To Rob's horror he found himself muttering the same thing. Involuntary tears streaming down his cheeks. He reached for the knife, which he had brought back to bed with him. He put it to his wrist and felt the cold steel blade biting into his flesh. Droplets of blood started to appear as the blade bit into his wrist. \"I seriously just want to die.\" Loneliness said in his monotonous drone. He hovered closer, his forlorn aura contaminating Rob even more intensely. \"My friend!\" Rob yelled at Loneliness suddenly, he leapt at Loneliness and wrapped his arms around Loneliness' mishapen body in an awkward embrace. \"I promise you that if I ever come to hell, I'll forever be your friend.\" Rob glanced up at the horrifying face of Loneliness, tears welled in his dead eyes and streamed down his deformed cheeks. \"You are sincere.\" Loneliness said in disbelief. Like Rob, Loneliness could also sense things, particularly emotion. Loneliness was touched. It had been several millenia since Loneliness had ever felt anything positive. \"You understand that by keeping your promise when you finally do come to hell, you will be condemned to an eternity of misery as my friend. I'm cursed by this aura of sadness and despair.\" \"Friends are always there for each other in times of need.\" Rob sobbed, a result of being in such close proximity of Loneliness. They spent an hour talking, Loneliness agreed to leave Rob alone in exchange for his friendship. But left him with a final warning. \"Beware of Darkness.\" He droned tediously. \"He is the Devil's favourite.\" With that, light shone from his eyes and mouth as he was banished back to hell. Rob felt the relief of Loneliness' absence almost immediately. He felt as if a huge weight had been lifted from his shoulders. \"I meant it when I said I'd forever be your friend if I ended up in hell.\" Rob smiled, knowing Loneliness had sensed he was being sincere. \"And IF I ever do end up in hell I'll honour that promise! Unfortunately Loneliness, I don't ever plan on going to hell!\" Rob was quite lonely. And the terrible aura Loneliness emitted had amplified that feeling to the point where Rob could barely restrain himself from ending his life. Fortunately he had outsmarted Loneliness, even though he did relate to the pathetic demon on some bizarre level. Two down......

'' Rob yelled at desolation suddenly , he leapt at desolation and wrapped his arms around desolation ' mishapen body in an awkward embrace. `` I prognosticate you that if I ever come to hell , I 'll forever be your friend. `` Rob peek up at the horrifying face of Loneliness , tears welled in his dead eyes and streamed down his deformed cheeks. `` You embody sincere. `` Loneliness said in mental rejection. Like Rob , Loneliness could also feel things , particularly emotion. solitariness was touched. It had been several millenia since Loneliness had always felt anything positive. `` You understand that by keeping your promise when you finally do come to hell , you will equal condemned to an eternity of misery as my friend. I 'm cursed by this aura of sadness and desperation. `` `` Friends are incessantly there for each other in times of need. `` Rob sobbed , a solution of being in such close proximity of Loneliness. They drop an hour talking , Loneliness agreed to leave Rob alone in exchange for his friendship. But forget him with a final warning. `` Beware of swarthiness. `` He drone on tediously. `` He embody the Devil 's favourite. `` With that , light shone from his eyes and mouth as he cost banished back to hell. Rob matte the relief of Loneliness ' absence almost immediately. He felt as if a brobdingnagian weight had been lifted from his shoulders. `` I meant it when I order I 'd forever be your friend if I ended up in hell. `` Rob smiled , knowing Loneliness cause sensed he was being sincere. `` And IF I ever do end up in hell I 'll honour that promise ! Unfortunately Loneliness , I do n't ever plan on going to hell ! '' Rob personify quite lonely. And the terrible aura Loneliness emitted had hyperbolize that feeling to the point where Rob could barely restrain himself from ending his life. Fortunately he had outsmarted Loneliness , even though he did relate to the silly demon on some bizarre level. Two down. . . . . . One to give out. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "Hank passed the food through the hatch, watching the prisoner kneel and take the serving tray, heavy and unweildy as it was. Mr. Greenwick, for all his stoicism, looked haggard today - his last day, Hank corrected himself. The looming prospect of death finally caught up to the curt, proper man, as it always did even with the toughest death row folk, leaving a husk in his place. Honestly, he never enjoyed seeing them like that. The federal prison system attracted a lot of psychopaths that got off on human suffering, there was no denying the bitter truth about the employees, and Hank felt it was his duty to undo at least some damage those people were causing. The inmates were going to die anyway, and they weren't hired to dole out revenge. To him, working with the death row inmates was something akin to the military service he so dearly missed. Something that held at least a tiny grain of ethical purpose. Mr. Greenwick never caused him trouble, and he found himself approaching the day of the man's execution with actual dread. It was ironic in its own way, when Hank thought about it loud and clear as he did then - every day, thousands of people die, but it's never a concern. Perhaps because they die unpredictably and suddenly, snuffed in an instant of imperceptible chance. But when a man's death becomes scheduled and inevitable, like Mr. Greenwick's upcoming rendezvous with a deadly chemical cocktail, well, then death becomes terrifying and sad. \"That's nice,\" the guard remarked, watching the inmate solemnly remove the plastic covers from each small container on the tray. \"That's very nice, Mr. Greenwick.\" The death row inmate smiled and grabbed a napkin, wiping his hands clean before snatching a warm croissant out of one of the trays. \"It's actually fantastic, Hank,\" the prisoner's dried-out, gaunt face melted into an uncharacteristic expression of fondness and pleasure. He shook the croissant in the air. \"Real bread! I missed it so much. Nothing beats the smell of fresh-baked dough, don't you agree? Listen - it crinkles if you squeeze it!\" As he talked and basically rubbed the pastry to his cheek, the guard grabbed a chair that stood at the opposite wall, pulled it up to the cell's door. Sat, observing the prisoner and his ritualistic handling of each of the dishes. \"Mind my company, Mr. Greenwick?\" \"No, not at all. I'm flattered, in fact.\" \"So, what have you got?\" \"Right! \" , the inmate sniffed and put a finger to his mouth, lapsing for a moment in deep thought. \"So, I requested some goulash, it's here, in this bowl - so, so fragrant, can you smell those sweet peppers? Then here, here we have a piece of smoked eel, a little bed of rice for it, of course...\" He pointed to another plastic plate. \"Oh and this! Famous Chinese dish, chicken feet in black bean sauce. Positively spicy and drippy. Some cous-cous..... And a taco, you can't go wrong with that.\" \"Seems like you've got the whole world in your tray,\" Hank remarked amicably. Carl Greenwick's spork dipped into the goulash. He sampled, savored, smacking his lips with closed eyes, and only then looked back at the guard. \"Oh yes. These are the dishes from my favorite cities. A token to take in the afterlife, in case it actually exists,\" For a moment, Mr. Greenwick's glance became sharp once again, and Hank tensed, catching up to the meaning of the prisoner's quip. His shoulders slumped when he drew the connection. Of course. Budapest. Lyon. Kioto. Zhengzhou. Abu Dhabi. Mexico. The guard shifted in place, once again facing the discomfort of connecting the polite, calculated gentleness of a person he curated for the last four years to the clinical and documented knowledge of this man outside the prison walls. The conversation hitched, like a record needle skipping on a faulty grove in the disc, and Greenwick studied Hank intently, only the noodles from the chicken feet slurping softly as the inmate consumed them. Hank shook his unease off. What was done, was done. The price was about to be paid. \"So, that's what you had..... before, when you were..... you know?\" \"A man of my age is allowed some nostalgia, I think,\" Greenwick smiled thinly. Hank nodded, as if he understood what the man was talking about. His prisoner broke a piece of eel off, shoving it into his mouth with a desperate, wholesome voracity. \"Good food is essential. I used to have really nice dinners before the kill. A hearty, satisfying meal weighs you down just so. There's none of that hungry, dangerous hurry that might spoil things, no twitchiness in your finger as it lays down on the trigger. You even breathe contently, which, as you can guess, Hank, is really important,\" Mr. Greenwick continued. His pale eyes lit up with the recollection. \"And your memories aren't of blood, and screams and people running, about slinking down the fire-escape thinking that everybody's eyes are on you..... You just remember that, that you had a pretty good time. Well. Sorry. Look at me ramble before I pass away, eh?\" Hank gulped. \"It's okay, Mr. Greenwick, we talked about it in quite some detail before. But I still don't- you don't seem like you're particularly sorry..... are you not?\" The inmate took his time to chew, savored the bits of croissant crust off his fingers. Well, he wasn't. Of course not. One thing is to make bad choices, take drugs, cut off your elderly mother's head while riding the wave of a particularly shitty trip. One thing is to get talked into a poorly thought-out heist and shoot two cops in panic. One thing is giving into perverted primal urges and ravage a 10-year-old girl, then panickedly kill her to cover the tracks. Quite another was to have a life-long system, an ideology, and a purpose. A dead-set course of action, premeditated and flawlessly executed for reasons more solid than hand-wrought steel. Regret, in Carl Greenwick's mind, stemmed from dissatisfaction, be it dissatisfaction with choice, outcome or consequence. In his case, though, he was satisfied. Totally. There was no flaw in neither his concepts or execution. His message was delivered and heard. \"No, Hank. I'm not. Those were not crimes of passion. Those were people I wanted dead, and eh..... making them dead, after all these years, I believe was the right choice.\" \"Many think such of you now.\" Mr. Greenwick shrugged. Beneath the spacious orange jumpsuit he looked so unassuming and small - Hank still couldn't believe him to be the person on FBI's \"Most Wanted\" list for eight whole years. It was chilling, and he caught himself truely feeling sorry that today it will all end. He'll end up with six murder-rapists and psychotic serial-killer wannabes, that lacked Mr. Greenwick's icy calm and tact, and his articulation, to boot. But even more importantly than losing an adequate inmate..... Beneath those words, he knew that Carl Greenwick was afraid to die. Still wasn't ready for it. Those who didn't fear death, usually killed themselves, not embarked on a 8-year trip around the globe to hide and shake the impending doom off. It was always sobering to see men like that to succumb to basic human biology. He will face the needle alone. On the needle's terms. No comfort before oblivion. \"It is their right. After all, I...,\" Greenwick paused, the spork hovering over the cous-cous. \"I..... I never deluded myself into thinking that I was above encountering consequences for my actions. I never got peace - but then, I wasn't exactly looking for it.\" \"It's admirable, Mr. Greenwick,\" Hank reassured. \"Welcome to the fanclub, Hank,\" the inmate chuckled, and Hank joined in, his laughter revebrating through the corridor. The fan-mail that Carl received to this day, was a source of low-key fun for both the inmate and the guard. The administration screened the prisoner's outgoing mail, not big on letting him write anything too instigating to the already unhinged \"followers,\" but the incoming mail was largely left uncensored - and thus, the most hilarious. There were other letters, too. Those which brought Mr. Greenwick no joy, but had instead cast a shadow over his face, shut him out, turned him into his unfeeling, murderous, focused doppelganger. Letters that he never opened - ones that started with a \"Dear son...,\" or \"I'm still missing you, Carl.\" Mr. Greenwick tilted the plate with the chicken feet to his lips, lapping up the last of the sauce. Put it down, cleaned his face - it had finally assumed that half-relaxed, determined look many of the death-row inmates were known to get on their final hours. Hank knew it wouldn't stay such for long. Other procedures - some humiliating, but even then, implemented to preserve the dignity of the condemned - awaited Carl Greenwick, and further down the road, there would be pain, terror and agony, before the final flutterings of the heart would still to peace. Ha, peace. \"I'm done, Frank,\" he lightly pushed the tray back to the hatch. Hank stood up and collected it. The bowls, containers and utensils were in perfect order. He imagined Greenwicks's sniper rifle parts to be in same pristine shape and practicality of position. No mess, no trouble. A last gesture of appreciation. No resignation, Hank was sure, for that hateful, dark edge never went away, but it wasn't like Mr. Greenwick had any way to show his gratitude in such an environment. Hank did his job well. There was no unnecessary suffering, and in return, he received a modicum of restraint. Not peace. Contentment. Perhaps, the greatest balance two men could achieve when separated by bars, by struggling altruism and buried bloodlust. \"That you are, Mr. Greenwick.\" As Hank walked away, the tray in his hands, he could feel Mr. Greenwick's mercury-tinged gaze follow him, boring into his back..... but for the first time, he didn't feel like a target. For some reason, that was the saddest thing.", "text_perturb": "hank passed the food through the hatch , watching the prisoner kneel and take the serving tray , heavy and unweildy as it was. mister.

Those who did n't fear death , usually killed themselves , not embarked on a 8-year trip around the globe to obscure and shake the impending doom off. It was always sobering to see men like that to succumb to basic human biological science. He will face the needle alone. On the needle 's condition. No solace before oblivion. `` It is their right hand. After all , I. . . , '' Greenwick paused , the spork hovering over the cous-cous. `` I. . . . . I never delude myself into thinking that I was above encountering consequences for my actions. I never have peace - but then , I was n't exactly looking for it. `` `` It 's admirable , Mr. Greenwick , '' hank reassured. `` Welcome to the fanclub , Hank , '' the inmate chuckled , and Hank link up in , his laughter revebrating through the corridor. The fan-mail that Carl received to this day , was a seed of low-key fun for both the inmate and the guard. The administration screened the prisoner 's outgoing mail , not big on letting him write anything too instigating to the already unhinged `` followers , '' but the incoming mail was largely left uncensored - and thus , the most screaming. There were other letters , as well. Those which brought mister. Greenwick no joy , but had instead cast a shadow over his face , shut him out , call on him into his unfeeling , murderous , focused doppelganger. Letters that he never opened - ones that started with a `` lamb son. . . , '' or `` I 'm still missing you , Carl. `` mister. Greenwick tilted the plate with the chickenhearted feet to his lips , lapping up the last of the sauce. arrange it down , cleaned his face - it had finally assumed that half-relaxed , determined look many of the death-row inmates were known to get on their final hours. Hank acknowledge it would n't stay such for long. Other procedures - some humiliating , but even then , implemented to preserve the dignity of the condemned - awaited Carl Greenwick , and further down the route , there would be pain , terror and agony , before the final flutterings of the heart would still to peace. Ha , public security. `` I 'm done , Frank , '' he lightly pushed the tray back to the hatching. Hank stomach up and collected it. The bowls , containers and utensils were in everlasting order. He imagined Greenwicks 's sniper rifle parts to live in same pristine shape and practicality of position. No mess , no fuss. A last gesture of perceptiveness. No resignation , Hank comprise sure , for that hateful , dark edge never went away , but it comprise n't like Mr. Greenwick feature any way to show his gratitude in such an environment. Hank coif his job well. There was no unnecessary suffering , and in recurrence , he received a modicum of restraint. not peace. contentment. Perhaps , the greatest balance two men could achieve when separated by bars , by struggling selflessness and buried bloodlust. `` That you live , Mr. Greenwick. `` As Hank walk away , the tray in his hands , he could feel Mr. Greenwick 's mercury-tinged gaze follow him , boring into his rachis. . . . . but for the first time , he did n't find like a target. For some reason , that cost the saddest thing. ", "label": 1}

I ran my fingers along the pattern of my long-john pants, something that I never had decided to do before. My dog smiled at me, thinking he was going out for a walk.

It was 6:25 pm on Friday, January 31st, 2039. My birthday was tomorrow and, fortunately, I had no one else to share it with. After getting dressed in my Weatherproof brand jacket, I left for the projects. I knocked on every door there was up until I came across apartment 6H. I asked for something to protect myself with and explained my situation. I was welcomed into what looked like a flophouse. The large, fit man explained that he doesn't normally sell to people outside his crew. He showed me a black Beretta 92 FS. As much as I hated to buy it, I did.

I checked my iPhone for the time. 11:45 pm on Friday, February 6th. And only one phrased echoed through my mind as I loaded up my Beretta, it's going to be okay. I had waited for her to break the door down. I heard the door open, not with a boom or a smash, but with a click. She had picked the lock. I waited in the living room for her on the same couch we made love on many years ago. \"Hello, Kayla.\" Hello, Christopher, she said, I know you've received notice. \"Yes, I have.\" I had refused eye contact with her. Chris, I don't want to take this out on the dog. Can you bring him out here? \"Yes, I'll go get him.\" She took guard at the only exit to my apartment while I moved to the back, where my room was. The dog looked at me, not smiling as usual, but worried. I said nothing, but my facial expression was enough. I grabbed my Beretta off of my desk, checking the safety to see if I had left it off like I had planned. I grabbed it and walked down my hallway softly. I begin to aim at Kayla.

I gave her the last gesture of love I would ever give to her. I kissed her cheek. I moved back, still aiming my gun at her, but this time at her chest, specifically where her heart was.

That was when you demolished half the house, was it? I never figured someone would choose an ass kicking contest as the game of chance with death. \" \"That aint no death. What I beat up was an ugly ass skelleton. No style or nothing. And I did nothing wrong. \" The stranger chose this moment to watch the old man, passionately, while stretching. fedora on his hat, slick white suit...... It seemed like he was looking in the mirror. He grabbed his stick closer. Hard hickory, with drilled in lead from a holy cross. You only make the same mistakes once. The stranger choose that very moment to lounge himself back in his seat, and from somewhere, produced a hipflask. \"You seem..... calm about it all. Figured I had to beat you red ass as well. \" Nothing but a shrug from the stranger. \"You know, I must admit, I love the style. Quite a couple of people are very angry at you. You know that, I know that. And I find that amusing. \" Silence, again. The old folks home was oddly quiet. \"You still mad that I tricked you?\" \"Initially, yes. But hell, I got you back, didn't i? \" He nodded. Who would have ever thought even recording industry bosses talked to the devil? \"You had three good songs in you, just as your manager wished for. You were quick about getting out of this. Very clever. Never touched your guitar again. Even cut the strings. Untill tonight, when you played for them. \" He sighed, and sat down, keeping both his hands on his heavy walking stick. He had a feeling lady luck was smiling tonight. \"Of course, I figured, why? Why that clinging to life? I mean, you were a prize. A soul that would have had the top shelf in my collection. \" \"I aint no part of no damn collection. That's for wussies. \" \"I guess your problems with being politically correct have not changed. Still, you knew what would happen...\" He nodded. Looking around, he took in the old folks home one last time. The floor, the walls...... his home for fourty years. \"What has changed? I would be curious about that. \" \"Take a guess. \" The stranger nodded. His head swiveled around, and for a second, even in the shade, he could see the yellow eyes of the stranger, glowing, as they looked around. Nothing much to say. More than this. \"Life. \" Just one word from the stranger. He knew. As long as it was good, it was better. He did not need much, and he was happy. But the scene changed. Blues was no longer in. He had tried to go with the times, had tried to get it on. he had even managed to get into a group that was performing, butr even the groupies recognised his age. Called him grandpa. And his fans? Allmost as old as he was. Lived through it all, found it all, and now, nothing more then empty husks. Former beauties that once were full of life just..... away. \"So, sit your five dollar ass down before I make change. We got ta talk. \" The stranger just smiled. \"I have ran away too long. I can feel it. My hip starts aching, my bones start crumbling....\" He sighed, Looking at the stranger, he wished he could look like that. Young again. Just to wake up and not curse yourself because you survived an other day. \"So I take it you want an other contract? An other request for a longer life? I warn you...\" \"Nothing like that, red-man. \" He could see the stranger looking..... intrigued. \"I learned my lesson. I take a wild guess and say you send me the broken hip. You had your bitchass fingers in there, when my sight went. \" His fingers flexed around the staff. He could feel the arthritis in his fingers. Too sore to play. Good enough to hold a stick. Still enough for a beatdown. The sound of splintering bones was still in his ears. \"I am willing to go quietly with you. \" The stranger looked expectantly. \"No buts about it. You have me, you found me, and you can take me. Can't be much worse then that. \" His hands encircled the room, but he meant everything. His children dead, his grandchildren forgetting he even existed except for the royalty checks he dished out..... as if he needed the money...... \"All I ask for...... is a job. \" The stranger nodded, but after a while. Seemed he had to think about it. \"What job?\" He had to chuckle. It was a thing of beauty. \"Did my research on this one. Figure I am not the only one to occasionally..... cause a ruckus? Tricks you or others like you?\" Barely more then a nod. A crumpling of the eyebrows. \"I figured..... special cases..... need a special hand. Special music, if you will. \" This time, he was prepared. Not a single motion in his face, as the yellow eyes mustered him. \"Why?\" Just a question. Most people would have asked what job, what for,...... he only wanted to know why. He looked down, and smiled. \"I figured, a trophy is one thing. You earned it, put it on your wall...... Only queers' into that sort of thing. \" He looked up. \"Saw a lot of pictures. Talked to the right people. Seems the \"Other side\" loves trumpets and loud....No style, if you ask me. Just like the damn kids today. The opposite would be quiet enough to kill the noise in a room, but heavy enough to strangle everybody that says shit. Figured you appreciate a trophy that does not rot, that does not moan, but that helps you, and you can show off?\" Very carefully, a smile crept over the strangers face. \"I know you into some strange business, and I figured, what to give a..... man..... that got everythang? Only thing I could think off is more style. \" A slight nodd from the stranger. His heart..... was lighter? He turned around and saw..... himself. His guitar on his lap, the hands closed on it. \"You died when I first showed up. Your heart gave up. One note does count as a song. THAT is how I do my homework. \" Now, he could see the stranger more clearly. \"You stank less, but you way more ugly. \" Night black flesh. even the gums. And the teeth. The blackest and darkest smile he ever saw. \"So, whats next? \" He wore his black suit. Crumpled, patched, but very comfy. His best shoes, his hat....In the right side were even his sunglasses, that he lost so long ago. Not a singular suit, but all the suits he ever wore, in one. \"Dying. \" \"I thought I am already dying? \" The stranger shook his head, and started walking. Gravel, even though they went through the wards of the old folks home. \"You are done with dying. This is the last step. \" \"Will..... will it hurt a lot?\" The stranger looked back, and he saw something curious in the strangers face. Pitty? Compassion? \"Not more then a bad gig. \" The stranger opend one of the doors on the side of the old folks home. He was hit by the smell of smoke, stale beer, and the sweat of people. Louisianna weather. \"I allways figured, a bluesman walks alone, but aint no bluesmann lived to tell of his deal with the devil.

His old comrades from the war...... \"That is..... more then I hoped for. \" Honest feeling in his voice. His voice, now smoother, and how he remembered it. He looed up, and saw the stranger take off his hat. Bald except for two bumps. And in his hands a Guitar. \"Bad PR, mostly. Must be all those bluesmen giing us a bad name.

Elves hid underground while water faries tried to seek refuge in the lakes. The somber grey followed anyone, everywhere. Nah looked out at the grey ocean where fishermen once reveled.

The colors were so bright that his eyes began to ache as he studied the untouchable image. He lowered his arm and questioned if such a place existed.

{"original_text": "Charon gently paddled the long oar across the dark waters, silence his only companion in the foggy waters of Styx. He craned his bony neck as he stared off into the distance, counting the number of souls awaiting to be ferried from the shore. The boat creaked and groaned, soft ripples emanating from the water surface, as he neared the shore. This was his first round in four decades, and the bloated crowd murmuring in the distance corroborated that fact. BOOM! A large gust of wind, smoke and dust swept the entire shore, the shattering sound of a humongous explosion swallowing the surprised screams of the victims. A huge shockwave swept the entire radius like a storm, sweeping everything in its path with a ferocious force. The ferry tipped to its side as Charon struggled to keep it afloat, dust and debris clouding his sight. Rocks and boulders cracked from the walls, rolling into the waters with a huge crush. Loud humming of machinery reverberated from the vicinity. Line after line of huge metallic tanks drove through the huge hole created by the explosion, their turrets protruding through the choking coat of dust and debris. \"Weitergehen! Keep moving!\" A voice shouted from one of the armored vehicles amidst the whirring chaos. He stepped out of the vehicle in a black trenchcoat and a visored cap. He stepped into the rubble, as he strode towards the shore, his eyes darting across the river. The vehicles soon came to a stop, several doors opened as uniformed men came out of the trucks. Their shoulders strapped in rifles, as they encompassed the shorter man. He held his hands over his crotch as he surveyed the distance, a crooked smile forming under his odd moustache. \"Friedrich!\" He called out in an authoritarian high pitch. A man broke through the large crowd armed in guns as he rushed to his beckon, fondling a paper in his hand. \"Zend out ze letter. I want you to write all ze details as I instructed earlier. I want it to reach to him in time.\" The moustached man posed in a stoic posture, his eyes still darting across the shore, as if in search for something. \"But fuhrer, in all respect he will need some proof of this expedition. Not many men would find this believable froma sheet of paper.\" Friedrich replied timidly. The moustached man strode forward across the shore over the rubble, staring at the cowering souls, several crushed under the huge weight of the boulders. \"What was ze name of his deceased daughter?\" He asked. \"Marigold Churchill. But she died in 1921, sir.\" Friedrich responded, his fingers busy scribbling across the paper. A smug of satisfaction wore his face again as he peered into the crowd. If his knowledge was correct, the ferrier of the dead travelled every fourty years. He turned toward the souls, clearing his voice in preparation. \"If your name zis Marigold Churchill, I oblige you to step forward!\" His voice echoed through the cavernous vicinity, ripples of murmurs stirred amongst the crowd. \"You have nothing to fear! Some of you may recognise who I am. But I am looking for Marigold Churchill, zere zis someone she has to meet.\" The crowd of again replied in a murmur. A small path opened between them, as they parted way for an unknown figure to pass through. Tiny feet pitter pattered across the rubble, walking towards the voice that called out for her. He craned towards her direction. Watching her appearance as she cleared from the gathering crowd as they peered down at her. Curiosity bubbling from the questioning faces. He tried to contain the chuckle but it was all in vain. He watched as her feeble hands stretch out to his, as he stretched out his own in response. He knelt down on one knee as he gazed at the child. Her infant palms holding onto his, as they stared upon each other. \"Friedrich.\" He called out, his eyes still lingering at upon his new found companion. \"Yes, my fuhrer.\" He stood up as he carried the child into his arms. \"Where was our next targeted destination?\" He chucked as the child stroked his thick mass of moustache, fondling it in her fingers. \"It was Russia, my fuhrer.\" Friedrich answered in a tremoulous cadence, trepidation evident in his words, fearing the response that was going to leave his master's toungue. He watched his Fuhrer's eyes, as they danced maniacally as they gazed upon the innocent child. He followed those eyes, as they changed their gaze from the child, and darted towards the Charon, who hovered in the murky waters of the Styx. \"Friedrich, cancel that schedule.

A large gust of wind , pot and dust swept the entire shore , the shattering sound of a humongous explosion swallowing the surprised screams of the victims. A huge shockwave swept the entire radius like a tempest , sweeping everything in its path with a ferocious force. The ferry tipped to its side as Charon struggled to keep it afloat , junk and debris clouding his sight. Rocks and boulders cracked from the rampart , rolling into the waters with a huge crush. Loud hum of machinery reverberated from the vicinity. Line after line of huge metallic tanks drove through the huge hole created by the explosion , their gun turret protruding through the choking coat of dust and debris. `` Weitergehen ! Keep moving ! '' A voice shouted from one of the armored vehicles amidst the whirr chaos. He stepped out of the vehicle in a bleak trenchcoat and a visored cap. He stepped into the rubble , as he stride towards the shore , his eyes darting across the river. The vehicles soon came to a stop , several doors unfold as uniformed men came out of the trucks. Their shoulders strapped in rifles , as they cover the shorter man. He held his hands over his fork as he surveyed the distance , a crooked smile forming under his odd moustache. `` Friedrich ! '' He called out in an authoritarian high pitched pitch. A man broke through the large crowd armed in guns as he festinate to his beckon , fondling a paper in his hand. `` Zend out ze missive. I want you to write all ze details as I teach earlier. I need it to reach to him in time. `` The moustached man posed in a stoic posture , his eyes still darting across the shore , as if in hunt for something. `` But fuhrer , in all obedience he will need some proof of this expedition. Not many men would find this believable froma sheet of newspaper. `` Friedrich replied timidly. The moustached man strode forward across the shore over the rubble , staring at the cowering souls , several crushed under the huge weight of the boulder. `` What was ze name of his at peace daughter ? '' He asked. `` Marigold john churchill. But she died in 1921 , sir. `` Friedrich responded , his fingers busy scribbling across the paper. A smug of atonement wore his face again as he peered into the crowd. If his knowledge was correct , the ferrier of the dead traveled every fourty years. He turned toward the souls , gain his voice in preparation. `` If your name zis Marigold Churchill , I oblige you to step forward ! '' His voice recall through the cavernous vicinity , ripples of murmurs stirred amongst the crowd. `` You accept nothing to fear ! Some of you may recognise who I am. But I am looking for Marigold john churchill , zere zis someone she has to meet. `` The crowd of again respond in a murmur. A small path opened between them , as they parted way for an obscure figure to pass through. Tiny feet pitter pattered across the rubble , walking towards the voice that call out for her. He craned towards her instruction. Watching her appearance as she cleared from the gathering crowd as they peer down at her. curiosity bubbling from the questioning faces. He tried to contain the chuckle but it represent all in vain. He watched as her feeble hands stretch out to his , as he load out his own in response. He knelt down on one knee as he stare at the child. Her infant palms holding onto his , as they stare upon each other. `` Friedrich. `` He called out , his eyes still lingering at upon his newfangled found companion. `` Yes , my fuhrer. `` He stood up as he contain the child into his arms. `` Where was our next target destination ? '' He chucked as the child stroked his thick mass of moustache , fondling it in her fingers. `` It personify Russia , my fuhrer. `` Friedrich answered in a tremoulous cadence , trepidation evident in his words , fearing the response that was exit to leave his master 's toungue. He watched his Fuhrer 's eyes , as they trip the light fantastic maniacally as they gazed upon the innocent child. He followed those eyes , as they changed their gaze from the child , and darted towards the Charon , who hovered in the cloudy waters of the Styx. `` Friedrich , natural that schedule. We get a new destination. ``", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "Joanna had strayed off the trail to find some privacy for a pee. She was hiking with two friends and truth be told, need a bit of alone time. They'd been hiking for 3 days and friends or no, she just needed a few minutes to herself. So Joanna put down her big pack and took ten steps into the bush. Just ten steps with nothing but her purse. Unfortunately for Joanna, she gets lost easily. Every time she leaves a store, she ends up walking back down the street the way she came. Knowing herself, maybe she shouldn't have gone off the trail. But she did, and she made a wrong turn. She walked and called out to her friends and walked some more, but she never found the path again. Hours later, the sun was setting and the cold air was turning bitter cold. Joanna was getting desperate. What luck then when she came across a log cabin! It was so old that no road led to it, no trail, it looked as though it had grown up out of the forest floor. The front door was open and all she could see inside was shadow. The darkness frightened her but Joanna, knew all too well how cold she would be outside tonight without a sleeping bag or tent. So she pulled out her flashlight and cautiously entered, hoping to make camp for the night. Inside there was only one room. It was sparse but looked like a seasoned outdoors-person could live comfortably if they gave it a little love. There was a bed frame in one corner, a counter and sink in another, and two windows overgrown with vines on the outside. Most importantly, there was a fireplace, Joanna checked and the flue opened. She went outside and saw the vines didn't make it all the way up the chimney. She just needed to start a fire. Back inside Joanna took a closer look at the large wooden farmhouse table that sat in the center of the room. An over-sized mechanical switch sat bolted to one corner of it. A switch with wires that ran off into a cupboard. Needing fire, and hoping on the off-chance that there were working batteries at the other ends of those wires, Joanna stood as far from the cabinet as possible, hoping nothing creepy crawly jumped out, and pulled open the cabinet. There were, indeed, two car batteries hooked up to the switch inside an otherwise empty cupboard. Joanna unclipped one battery, and brought it over to the fireplace. Touching the leads together gave off a nice spark. Armed with a plan, Joanna walked around outside the house collecting firewood, small kindling twigs, and moss and built a comfortable fire inside the cabin. It wasn't until she was nice and warm next to the fire that she was relaxed enough to think about where she was and she started to feel uneasy. Everything in this cabin was old and run down but those batteries had looked brand new. Joanna inspected the switch more closely. It was rusted and covered in dust. It could have been as old as the rest of the cabin. Next to it was one word carved crudely in the table \" Don't \" with an arrow pointing to the switch. She went back to the cabinet and looked for wires leaving. She found a pair, headed down into the space below the cabinet. She couldn't follow them further without a crowbar to rip out the boards. She wondered if there was a sub-floor or a basement and looked around for an access panel. The floor was all solid oak floorboards. She walked around and not one budged not even a hair. Joanna's attention then turned to the bed frame. It was a wooden bed frame, with a single piece of plywood covering the place where the mattress should go. Strangely, it had a few bolts at each corner that were not rusty and had been painted black. They looked brand new. One corner had a small recess, just big enough to get a hand under the board to lift. Joanna was curious enough to want to know but not brave enough to put her hand into dark places, so she jammed the end of her flashlight in and used it as a lever to lift. No matter how hard she pried it wouldn't budge. She shined her light in that little recess and saw a bright reflection, maybe there was a little clasp there. She needed something small and rigid to get at it. She pulled out a pen from her purse and it did the trick. No sooner had she pushed in the little metal clasp than the plywood piece popped open and there was a deafening bang. Joanna was off to the side against the wall, out of the way of the blast. The shot had gone straight over the table and buried itself in a large fur hung above the fire. The gun had been inside the bed frame and now hung there dangling from a mount. It was rigidly mounted, precisely aimed, right at where anyone who threw that switch would be standing. Without thinking, Joanna went for the gun. Two leather belts held it rigidly to a rod, which she quickly loosened. Joanna knew a little bit about guns, she knew this was a double barrel shotgun, and that meant it should have two shots. She looked for a release and found how to open the barrel and check. Two shells inside, one was spent. If this was a trap, someone would be coming to check on it. And that fire made her a target for miles. She wouldn't be getting any sleep tonight.", "text_perturb": "Joanna had strayed off the trail to regain some privacy for a pee.

It was sparse but looked like a seasoned outdoors-person could live comfortably if they gave it a piddling love. There was a bed frame in one corner , a counter and sink in another , and two windows overgrown with vines on the exterior. Most significantly , there was a fireplace , Joanna checked and the flue opened. She went outside and saw the vines did n't make it all the manner up the chimney. She just involve to start a fire. Back inside Joanna took a finisher look at the large wooden farmhouse table that sat in the center of the room. An over-sized mechanical electric switch sat bolted to one corner of it. A switch with conducting wire that ran off into a cupboard. Needing fire , and hoping on the off-chance that there were working batteries at the other ends of those telegram , Joanna stood as far from the cabinet as possible , hoping nothing creepy crawly jumped out , and pulled open the cabinet. There were , indeed , two car batteries hooked up to the substitution inside an otherwise empty cupboard. Joanna unclipped one battery , and brought it over to the open fireplace. Touching the leads together gave off a nice electric discharge. Armed with a plan , Joanna walked around outside the theatre collecting firewood , small kindling twigs , and moss and built a comfortable fire inside the cabin. It was n't until she was nice and warm next to the fire that she was relaxed enough to think about where she was and she set out to feel uneasy. Everything in this cabin was erstwhile and run down but those batteries had looked brand new. Joanna visit the switch more closely. It was eat and covered in dust. It could have equal as old as the rest of the cabin. Next to it was one word chip at crudely in the table `` Do n't `` with an arrow pointing to the switch. She conk out back to the cabinet and looked for wires leaving. She found a pair , head up down into the space below the cabinet. She could n't follow them further without a wrecking bar to rip out the boards. She wondered if there exist a sub-floor or a basement and looked around for an access panel. The floor was all solid oak tree floorboards. She walked around and not one budged not even a pilus. Joanna 's attention then turn over to the bed frame. It was a wooden bed frame , with a single piece of plywood insure the place where the mattress should go. Strangely , it had a few bolts at each corner that were not rusty and had constitute painted black. They looked blade new. One corner had a small inlet , just big enough to get a hand under the board to lift. Joanna was peculiar enough to want to know but not brave enough to put her hand into dark places , so she jammed the end of her flashlight in and used it as a lever to lift. No thing how hard she pried it would n't budge. She glint her light in that little recess and saw a bright reflection , maybe there was a little clasp there. She needed something small and rigid to engender at it. She pulled out a pen from her purse and it cause the trick. No sooner had she pushed in the little metal clasp than the plyboard piece popped open and there was a deafening bang. Joanna exist off to the side against the wall , out of the way of the blast. The shot had gone straight over the table and buried itself in a large fur hung above the fervidness. The gun had been inside the seam frame and now hung there dangling from a mount. It was rigidly mounted , precisely aimed , right at where anyone who threw that electrical switch would be standing. Without thinking , Joanna give way for the gun. Two leather belts harbour it rigidly to a rod , which she quickly loosened. Joanna knew a little bit about guns , she knew this personify a double barrel shotgun , and that meant it should have two shots. She looked for a release and found how to open the barrelful and check. Two cuticle inside , one was spent. If this was a trap , someone would be coming to check up on on it. And that fire made her a target for swedish mile. She would n't be getting any sleep tonight. ", "label": 1}

A week later I'm trying to explain to a hooker with a black eye that I'm not a violent woman beater, I'm just scared of ghosts in my bed. Imagine how well that went over. Oh, and while I'm complaining - why can't they just wake me up? They've got no problem with barging into my home unannounced in the middle of the night, but after that they'd rather politely wait until I get up on my own and see them out of the corner of my eye. How fucking considerate. This one looked about 17 or 18 years old, dressed in all white (the girls always are for some reason). Her hair came down to the small of her back, and her eyes were wide open, with the pupils fully dilated. If you had covered the bottom half of her face you would have sworn she was screaming her lungs out. \"What do you want?\" I asked, probably a little too aggressively. I knew what she wanted. Everyone who came here always wanted the same thing. She didn't reply. Instead, she slowly held out her hand. Clenched in her fist was a photo of a man, slightly balding with a scraggly beard. His eyes matched the girl's and his chin had the same sharp point as hers. This was a first. Not parents killing their kids, but the kids coming back for revenge. Usually they've been raised from birth to blame themselves for whatever the twisted fucks do to them. I looked at the picture again, and then asked \"Where is he?\" She slowly walked to the door, and then through it. Also, can I just say, they NEVER wait for you to get your shoes on, or get your shit together, nah. They just fucking leave and you have to keep up with them or else they come back again the next night. I swear, I hate ghosts almost as much as I hate living humans.

The door swung open swiftly and silently, no alarms going off except for the one in my head that this was a little too easy.

He was resting in an armchair, his head lolling slightly from side to side. I could only see the top half of his head, but I was sure it was him. The slight balding, the shape of his head, yeah this was the guy alright. Okay so normally I stage an accident, or maybe shoot from a distance, but tonight I was wearing one shoe, a ripped up tshirt and teddy bear boxers. I guess I could just snap his neck? I started to take a step closer. Suddenly the head jerked up. I froze in my tracks, trying to decide whether I should rush him and kill him now, or run back and try again with a better plan. I kept waiting for another movement but it seemed as though he had gone back to sleep. Alright, it's now or never. Just get it over with I thought. There's no point in prolonging this any more. I started to move towards him, ready to snap his neck in a quick fluid motion and then get the hell out of here. I was maybe a couple steps away when I saw the gun. Wait, what?

{"original_text": "There's a certain story goes around the more maritime pubs up in Newfoundland - different iterations year to year, but same enough that old salts'll grumble every time it comes up. \" Aw lay off it, lads, Gaspar Corte-Real told that one afore he even got to Newfie ,\" they'll insist, but they listen anyway. Someone even wrote up a decent shanty, gives a good beat to casting off. The verse is whatever the mate can come up with while he watches you work, but we all know the chorus: \" Twas reddnin'late when the gale came down And a cry went up from the foremast hand I ain't ne'er seen such a darkling sky On lake nor sea nor land! Twas a hundred set sail that year, To cruise down to Maui's shores But only one e'er saw his home, On an empty deck beset by gore! \" Usually, the crew were devoured by some vicious serpent, saving the last for its own demented enjoyment, some freak wave cleared the decks, or a sinner brought God's wrath with lazy swabbing. It was always a deeply moral tale. Thing was, I hadn't done anything remotely untoward the whole voyage, and last night was dead calm. It wasn't even my watch. Yet there it was - forty three men, reduced to a new coat of red across the deck. I'd lost plenty of shipmates by then - foundered off Gibralter once, and watched an Indiaman pull the best crew I'd sailed with into water barely ten fathoms deep. Bully boys die bully deaths. You don't cry over the condemned. Still, I figured I'd sat there scratching my head long enough, so I made my way to Captain Barett's quarters, and started poking through his sea chest. The tattered map at the bottom stopped my hand as I remembered the strange talk of the last few watches. Any man that's been on a few rounds knows exactly where he is with a glance skyward on a clear night, and the only one we'd had had been enough to spark scandal throughout the crew. We'd been hunting Limey's, so no one could work out how we'd drifted deep into Norwegian waters. But one verse of the old chant did come up more often than most - \" Well the captain he said damn the dead, there's treasure to be found!

{"original_text": "Their shadows danced across the cracked, forgotten sidewalks of Mulberry Lane. James and Sally ran, their business shoes sank into the soft hill of Mr. Henderson's front yard, where we had first met, and they evaporated into the dry, March heat, leaving me and their shoes behind. My vision grew hazy, as I grew tired. I bent over a forest green and chipped brown - from rust - bench, and sighed heavily as my face dripped sweat onto the faded pavement. Twenty years ago, I fainted biweekly at recess. The doctors told my mother that I had asthma, and that I was to not have any strenuous physical activity without the use of an inhaler. But, upon seeing the cost, she turned to me, bowed and shook her head to the man, and we took the bus back to the hotel. From then on, I read Faulkner at recess. I couldn't blame her, though. She was a single mother, trying to support an overweight child. And waitresses usually don't get paid much. She would work until eight, so after school, I would sometimes follow my peers to their respective homes, out of both curiosity and loneliness. Some lived in sedans, others in trailers while I lived in a hotel just two blocks from a house of burlesque. But she lived across from him. In houses on Mulberry Lane. And they would write notes to each-other after dinner every night. It would be their secret way of communicating. But, little did they know, I was looking on with a brown, toy telescope I took from school after lunch. Her hair was golden as her face was a doll's, and she was my first real crush. One windless day, I followed nearer than I usually did. And softly laughed at jokes they made, and ran through scenarios in my head of what I would respond to them. I got nervous just thinking about it. And as we walked towards their houses, they decided to take a left, down a narrow path lined with cigarette butts and green benches towards a large hill. I tepidly followed to see a white house peaking atop it. And there started their tradition. And there ended mine. For they saw me and ran to me to broach why I followed them. But beyond outrage and concern, all I had heard was the silk of her tone and longevity of her syllables. Two seconds after they had finished talking, I forgot what they had said or why they said it. But her soft fingers touched my arm and yelled \"You're it!\" and she and him ran from me and I looked on, confused. So I ran. For the first time in ages, I ran. They were together, always together, but I could never tag her back. After nearly grazing their clothes, they pressed their tennis shoes into the hillside and left my grasp to laugh and hold hands back to their houses. \"Same time tomorrow?\" I heard one of them yell. Sure I yelled in return before fainting. So for afternoons after school, I agreed. For days on weekends, I agreed. For days in breaks I agreed. I agreed. I agreed. And fainted almost every day for the next Seven years. Contact between them only increased from then on as contact between me and her had ceased. Their notes became phone calls and their walk homes became car rides. They would summit the hill and roll down with each other, and one day they kissed in front of me. He began to drive and they soon forgot about the hill. About me. About whatever was there from the beginning. And I grew lonely again. And more curious. But as I went to University and studied the arts of man, the conquering of Mathematics and intricacies of the soul, I realized that what was left of myself was a mere stepping stone for them, a shell for every endeavor they needed me. But I chased anyway, I chased an impossible goal at the time. Even after several failed relationships, parties, and self-discovering explorations I still wanted to catch them, to find the piece of myself that got away. To fulfill my empty childhood. So whenever I had free time, I would go to the hill and read Faulkner. In the rain, in the sun, in times of sorrow and in times of light. After my mother's funeral and even when I had broken both of my legs, I still found a way back to the hill. And, in the process of doing so, lost what I had sought to gain again time after time. Until one day they had returned and saw me sitting upon a bench, reading under a streetlight and began again what had started when we were children. Only, what stood before me were two, worn adults. One in a two-hundred dollar suit and one in a black dress, both expected to be on the next cover of Forbes magazine. Though prim, their inner children had not died. For they then proceeded to duck and dodge, just as they did in distant years past. Trailing me in impossible loops, having me jump over benches and under branches. And then escaping me again by climbing Henderson's hill. They laughed and squealed at their victory atop it. And, with matching rings, they overlooked their kingdom and their sweating fat jester from primary school to yell \"Nothing's changed, fatass!\" They watched him sweat, and pant, and nearly shed tears over his loss. They watched him then clench and hold fists and stomp furiously up the hill, knocking their left-behind shoes down. They watched him edge closer, still laughing, their remorse ever absent. They watched as he grabbed them both. Then they became silent. He wadded what he grasped into balls and extended each arm forward, toppling the couple down the hill once more. Yelling \"You're it!\" when they snapped their necks on the benches. He's the one you want, your honor. Not me. For I am not that man. I am a tortured soul, withered by years of malice and ill-will!

{"original_text": "The United Nations declared war has been illegal, globally, nearly 50 years ago. Few countries ever stepped out to fight another war but the rest of the world would not have it. So those countries were destroyed. Out of fear or content of this, no nation or government ever opposed the UN again. However, people found loopholes and found non-physical ways of fighting each other. Some gambling was done, betting large sums of money on sporting and Olympic events. This sent some global powers into a down spiraling economy and forced them to ban gambling of any kind. Even to go so far as setting up departments within the UN to put a stop to any gambling or its causes. This was successful and led to a declining interest in most sporting events, the only people interested in it now were those that played it. Causing significant reductions in payment to the players and with all of that money now circulating, created a boost to most of the globes economy. Cyber-terrorism being illegal as well, subtle psychological warfare across the internets outlets would cause large increases of suicide rates all across the globe. This too was solved by improved social reform. Assisting the citizens of the world to become more open to new and stronger bonds with one another. Not only reducing the suicide rates to their previous numbers, but having a steeper decline for nearly a decade after the reform. By this point, gaming had become the largest industry of anything in history. The gaming console HUMAN was created as a universal gaming computer. It would do away with such things as key, mouse, controller, headset and give you two options for interface: Kinetic or Neural. The kinetic interface was the recommended interface since it forces your body to be active throughout interfacing. You would use hand motions, finger twitches, body language and sometimes a hum to perform any task you desired. You move, you interface. The neural was recommended only for those incapable of using the kinetic interface effectively. Such as those with loss of limb or are unable to use their legs. It was also, widely more popular than the kinetic interface due to it's speed and convenience compared to the kinetic interface. You think, you interface. As the HUMAN console improved in design and began to overwhelm other gaming devices, especially with the neural interface later adding the ability to use all fives senses. Creating the fullest immersion in history, and causing some people to truly confuse what is reality and what is the game. After HUD's were made unique for the HUMAN, and it was made illegal to produce a real-life replica, the console also saw progress in the fields of neuroscience with the aspects of dreams. Being that the original use of the HUMAN was that it is a gaming computer, gaming companies now began to draw on the brain power of the users, rather than relying solely on artificial processors. Using the subconscious of the users to create a small world that was drawn from their dreams and then combining them in virtual reality with others dream worlds. The hidden interest of nations now becomes obvious when several global powers purchase thousands of HUMANs and began training soldiers as gamers. Within a day, these countries fought hundreds of battles, throwing the caution of their lives to the wind since they were allowed to live even when killed. Quickly, the world did see what needed to be done. War was going to be replaced by virtual war. With all of it's benefits of rising economy but not a single death would come out of it. Gaming companies began generating battles for nations to fight in. Historical battles, mythological battles, fantasy and science-fiction, one on one combat in the Roman Colosseum or knife fighting in an alley. These battles would give the victorious nations points. Each point would be determined by the effectiveness of each gamer and their actual determination to win, measured by their heart rate and chemicals released during a battle. To see if a gamer that is doing well actually cares about the outcome or is gaming to play a game. Common examples of battles would be the Battle of Normandy, the First Fight on Mars (a science fiction battle) and the Battle of the Five Armies (a simulation derived from the fantasy novel \"The Hobbit\" and fought by five nations at a time. By request, a globe sized survival was made that would typically be used for simulations that would be given to two people from each nation to control and they would be given an Adam Eve situation. Two people, male and female, and the Earth, 10,000 years ago. They would then pick a place on Earth to begin and run the simulation as they saw fit. The more successful their simulated human race, the more points to their nation in the real world. You win by reaching modern technology in an earlier year than anyone else. Prize: Victorious nation is given more luxury food. Another is that each nation would have one person to play in a \"slice of life\" simulation. Where each gamer was intent on playing a specific role in a world full of a non player characters (NPCs). They could only win by figuring out who the other gamers were and which nation they were from and then presenting all of that information at a time to the United Nations gamer, who's identity was also kept secret. Prize: Victorious nation annexes a nation of choice. These games, these battles, have been broadcast on television for anyone who is not a gamer to enjoy on several dozen channels. With free roam spectator cameras in some simulations and first person perspectives in others. The gamers were idolized by the world, and it is no surprise that soldier gamers were replaced by the real gamer.

We were all disorientated from the neural link giving our brains input instead of our real senses. I'm sure most of us were used to it, just not the military grade HUMANs. The connection felt colder somehow, cleaner and..... flawless. The area was stone and mud for ground. With more stone for walls, in ruin and some in only minor disrepair. All of it evidence that we were in a medieval or fantasy setting. Possibly a modern game but a historical site. When it became clear that no one in our group would take charge, one of our members seemed to push his chin up to fake a bit of confidence and begin declaring himself the leader. \"My name is Met. We're going to need to find out where the rest of our teams are, get in communication. But first, we need shelter and defenses, weapons to hunt and fight with. Does anyone have any questions?\" The group seemed to agree with him, none of us really objected to his ideas and nothing he said, even after that, seemed to be in his own interest. We traveled mostly, we weren't given any supplies past the clothes on our backs and a days worth of food in our inventories. Every so often I would check the numbers, the stats on how many players and nations were still in the game. Not much happened the first few nights, but after about a week something must have happened because the players dropped by a few thousand. It continued for days and the numbers rose each day. When it finally slowed to only hundreds a day, after only 20 days in the game, the numbers had dropped to nearly 3.5 million left. We found the rest of our teams rather quickly. Apparently we had already suffered 32 in losses. Met seemed subtly proud that we hadn't lost anyone, although our only hostile encounter so far was a bear and we killed it with makeshift (virtual) spears. Our leaders convened and decided on reorganizing everyone while we were all together. The most successful leaders thus far, Met and two others I had never seen before, were voted as generals. The group was split into three groups with ours being the smallest only containing about a hundred people. 102 I think, I wasn't sure if Met counted in that number. I never thought much of it, since we were a hundred versus 3 million. Met though, he seemed to have more charisma every day. Swooning about how we would defeat every last one of them if we were just patient. If we would just survive long enough, we would make it. It gave us all false hope of really making it through with a victory, for a while. All of us knew when we signed up that this was a job and afterwards, win or lose, we'd get paid more than we could have in any other gaming circuit. Then it happened, somehow Met knew. After wondering through pine forests and past the same textures of ruined castle walls and small empty villages, we found our ultimate weapon. \"An Easter Egg,\" he called it. I scoffed at the idea of calling it an egg. He explained further, \"I've done enough of these military games to know, every single one of them has an Easter Egg. And it's always some super weapon or incredibly big advantage like that.\" He was smiling at it like he knew it was there the whole time. While the rest of us were just trying to take in that what we found was a missile silo. A nuclear missile silo, with unlocked doors and very deep underground bunkers.

Sure, it was a little strange that he wanted the room so dark, but nothing could make her happier than to make him feel happy in his own home. After all, he'd been gone for so long. Next to the sofa, baby Jenna cooed in her crib. She rolled onto her back, and was squeezing her plump little feet in her hands. Louisa had pulled her crib into the living room, so Jenna could finally meet her Father when he woke up from his nap. But her father had been napping for rather a long time. And that smell coming off of him - like hot metal and something..... not rotten, but close. \"Honey,\" Louisa said, sitting herself in the crook of his legs. \"Mmm,\" Scott grunted, not even bothering to budge - let alone look at her. \"Honey,\" she said again, putting a hand on his thigh.

Perhaps he just needed some light? Before her hand could even touch the curtains, Scott was sitting up. \"Don't.\" \"I just thought \"Don't, \" he growled. She'd never heard him talk like that before. Her voice caught in her throat, and without a word, she retreated from the room. Space Fatigue. It has to be Space Fatigue.

{"original_text": "The Man was next to her. He always was. His body against her back, the tall grass of the meadow pressed flat beneath them. His breath was wet and slow on her neck. She shifted her body slowly, pulling away from him. His arm reached out, heavy with sleep, and pulled her back. His hips pushed forward, moving himself closer to the warmth between her legs. She forced her body still and stared into the twilight, studying the outline of the trees. Memorizing the golden glow of each shape. She would wait for the dark to come, and she would walk again. Woman walked through the trees, her ears heavy with the quiet that overtook the forest at night. She listened to her breath and wondered at it's sound. A rustle on the path behind broke her peace. She started and turned. It was Snake. Snake slithered his way along the path, the moonlight catching his scales, shining in a way to make him look wet. Snake curled at her feet and lifted his head toward her. \" Do you remember Rabbit? \" He asked. His voice was worried and hushed. The night was quiet between for a moment. Women knelt down and looked at him. \" Yes, I remember Rabbit. \" Rabbit was always rushing. He was fast and nervous and quick. One day Rabbit was looking for clover in the meadow, and Snake came up behind him. Rabbit leapt from fright, and raced toward the brambles in the thicket. But his long back leg became tangled in the thorns. He twisted and squeaked in panic. There was a snap and Rabbit began shaking. He back leg stuck out at an old angle. Snake cried out \" Help. Help. \" Man and Woman were walking nearby. Man grabbed Woman and ran towards the noise. \" I only meant to say hello \" Snake said, his tongue flicking in agitation as Man and Woman approached. Snake twisted on the ground in confusion. The three of them were staring at Rabbit when God walked out of the forest. They moved closer to the thicket as God sat down next to Rabbit. God placed a hand on Rabbit's shaking head. Rabbit went still, his body wet and tangled in the thorns. They all stared. Man was upset. \" Why does't he jump ,\" man exclaimed. \" Why doesn't he eat. \" God looked at Man, \" Jumping and eating, those are for the living. \" Man looked at Rabbit, his eyes growing dark. \" Rabbit is dead \" he said. The word came to him from the air around him, a thing both familiar and unknown. Dead. \" Yes, Rabbit is dead \" God answered. Man took a step back out of fear, his heel almost striking Snake. Snake coiled and hissed. Man knelt down and took Snake in his hands, to comfort him. God watched quietly. Man looked at Rabbit once more, lying still on the grass. \" Will I be dead, one day? \" \" Yes \" God said. \" And me \" said Snake, curling around Man's arm in worry \" Will I be dead? \" Yes, one day \" God said, so softly, that Man and Snake both strained to hear. Both Man and Snake looked with worry at God, \" Why, we don't want to be like Rabbit. \" They cried. \" It is the way of this Earth \" God said simply. \" Will you die? \" Said Snake, suddenly shy, curling his head behind Man. \" No. \" Said God. For a moment, all were silent, and the only noises were the that of the forest. Crow cried in the distance and Man looked back towards the noise. \" Crow is eating the berries you picked \" God said, his eyes still on Rabbit. Man placed Snake back on the grass. \" I've told Crow not too, but he won't listen \" Man exclaimed, and he hurried back into the forest. Rabbit was forgotten. Snake turned his black eyes towards the brambles one last time, and slithered quickly away. Woman walked closer the thicket and sat next to God. \" I want to hold him .\" God untangled Rabbit's small body from the bushes and placed him in Woman's arms. Woman stroked his head for a moment and whispered. \" Does he hurt? \" she asked. \" No \" said God. \" How do you know? \" She asked. God was quiet. Woman placed Rabbit on the grass, taking care to tuck in his legs, as if he were sleeping. As she walked into the forest, Woman did not forget. The night was all around them and Woman was breathing heavily as she looked at Snake. \" I remember .\" Snake curled on the ground. \" I don't want to die \" he said. \" That is the way of this Earth \" Woman said, remembering God's words. It felt good knowing. \" It doesn't have to be \" said Snake. \" Man forgot about Rabbit, but I did not. \" Said Snake. \" Nor did I \" said Woman. \" Follow me \" said Snake. The path in the woods was dark, but Snake knew the way. The trees were tall and wild, with branches like hands that felt for you in the dark. Woman stayed close to Snake and they soon found themselves in a clearing. The grass was silver in the moonlight and rippled like water in the midnight wind. Two trees were in the clearing. One tree was tall and beautiful. It was blooming, even in the dark of night. It's flowers were fragrant and the fruit on it's branches was fat and ripe. The other was twisted and bent, as if it grew against a raging wind. It's branches were gray and pale, but they held a small fruit that shimmered in the dark.

I can not climb fast enough. You must run and get us fruit. \" \" Why must I run? \" Snake turned his head. Off to the side of the clearing was Angel. He was sleeping, his head propped up against a tree root. His sword of fire sat next to him. A shudder of fear went through Woman. Snake coiled tighter and hissed. Woman turned her eyes back on Snake. \" I will only have time to reach one tree, even if I were as fast as Rabbit. \" Snake blinked his eyes, she could see fear in them. Woman stood, tense, ready to run. Angel stirred in the distance, his hand reaching out to his sword. \" There are things worse than Death \" Woman murmured, and she took off running. Her legs were strong and sure as she cut across the clearing. She heard a howl that was not for this Earth, and she knew Angel was coming for her. The air stung in her lungs as she ran faster and faster. The trees were in front of her, and she turned left, racing toward the twisted branches. She could not worry about Snake. Or Rabbit.

{"original_text": "First it was a humming noise, like any machine made. Then, it started vibrating in pitch. Slowly, it transformed into the voice of a singer, growing more and more complex, purely on a single note. The neural network was working more effectively than expected. Funnily enough, it started to sound like it was singing the letter E. An unusual letter, but quite common. The nural network must have been catching on quite fast. However, the E gradually transitioned into a the letter L. At this point, my 6 other team members and I started scratching our heads, but we listened intently. Never before had this been accomplished. We kept the machine going as we sat through lunch. It was still singing the same constant pitch, with the letter L still being sung. As we got through two pizzas, we looked over to find the humanoid bot, as it kept singing. The neural network much have gotten a hitch. Greg finally yelled over to Jim to go use his \"impact maintenance\" on the darn thing. Reluctantly, Jim slothed over to the computer hooked up to the bot, and reached edit the code, but before he could stroke a key, the sound changed into an EH sound, and transitioned into a PH. As we stood there stunned, it managed to pronounce an ANT sound. 'Elephant' We didn't know what to make of it, but the sound was beautiful, as the bot started singing the registry settings, the tone carried a tear into my eye. It was the female reincarnation of Luciano Pavarotti, so unanimously, and without a word being spoken, it was decided to name her Lucy. Excited, in a fit of pleasure, we started slowly dancing with each other, fixated on the beautiful music Lucy produced. But as we switched her off for the day, a spark flew out from her breast. We thought nothing of it in our jovial state. Over the course of weeks, the people higher up, decided to capitalize on the voice they heard. They drafted plans to have her sing in operas around the world. The room they did this in was on big circle jerk of random ideas, each more outlandish than the last. But in her first show, disaster struck. She failed. Every note produced worse than the last, but the people seemed to think it to be funny. By the end of the show, the theater was howling with laughter, overpowering the sound of the opera itself. Each show that Lucy played in was like this. The laughing and jeering only brought in more of a crowd, and so, driven by greed, the people higher up exploited this, night after painful night. Lucy could not feel the pain. She did not know what laughter was, but we knew that she hurt.

Every note produced worse than the last , but the people seemed to think it to be odd. By the end of the show , the field was howling with laughter , overpowering the sound of the opera itself. Each show that lucy played in was like this. The laughing and scoff only brought in more of a crowd , and so , driven by greed , the people higher up exploited this , night after painful night.

I'm sure it'll crack against my dry lips on day. I fan the flames on what little fire is left from last night, and hold my palms up to the flame. I remember the softness of her skin as I took her, the warmth of her body rising through her cold and prickled skin. I waved my hands in the air, trying to recreate the sensations of that night..... the way her thighs rose to the touch of my fingertips, the glimmer of the stars reflected in the black of her eyes. Her breath rose in silver spindles against the cold, dark sky, and I followed it to meet her lips. \"It's a bit chilly,\" she giggled nervously. \"Wouldn't you rather go inside?\" \"Are you nervous someone might see us?\" I asked, reaching my hand behind her neck, and pulling her to my lips before she could answer. I could feel the wetness that matted her hair, the moistness on her back from the sea spray that had lined the deck we were lying on. I grabbed the bottle of wine beside us and took a swig before offering it to her as well. It was a vintage. 100-years old, it claimed in thin, swooping letters etched on the side of the bottle. It tasted like a two-buck chuck, nonetheless.

Footsteps echoed around the bend and she dashed to her feet, pushing me off of her. \"It's one of the guards. They realized we're not in our rooms! I told you we should go back inside!\" \"Your father wouldn't have let me visit you in your room!\" She dashed to hide behind a dark corner of the ship and I chased after her, panting from the excitement. \"Idiot! We almost got caught!\" she pushed on my chest. \"My father would have killed us if he found out!\" \"Your father intends to kill me anyways,\" I said. \"Yeah, but not me!\" She smiled, devilishly, as she said it. I pressed myself against her. The footsteps were just around the corner, growing closer, and somehow the fear that should have been at play instead only made me more bold, more excited. I reached around her and held her against my body. \"We're getting married as soon as the boat lands, anyways. What's the difference?\" She was about to yelp, but caught the sound in her throat. Glaring at me, she whispered, as angrily as she could muster \"Don't you dare! You can wait, you dog!\" She smiled then and gave me a gentle kiss on my neck. Then the fear washed over her as she pushed me away and pointed to the spot we were just lying at. \"Our wine, you nitwit! You left it out there\" \"Crap!\" I yelled, peaking around the corner to see if I could dive for it. The footsteps turned the corner and I could see the sailor's flashlight. He stopped at the back of the ship and placed the flashlight on the ground, stepping on it with his foot to keep it from rolling off with the bucking of the waves. Turning to face the starboard side of the ship, he unzipped his pants and began to relieve himself from the side of the railing. I eased my way towards the bottle, as quiet but quick as I could manage. Just as I took my last step to reach down for it, the boat shook with a thunderous crash. I could hear steel bending, creaking from the front of the ship. The horn of the ship blew three times. A rogue wave. Shit. I turned and made eye contact with the guard, who, was still mid-whiz but was now gripping onto the railing for his life. The ship bucked like a bull, throwing itself into the sky, and I was thrown from the back, right between the railings and into the water. I struggled to stay afloat, and between the battering of the waves, I could hear my fiance' screaming, and the horn of the boat growing further and further away. I had woken up on this pitifully small island, the bottle of wine I \"rescued\" just inches from myself, half-filled with sand-muddled seawater. I had waited two months on that ship, counting down for the moment it would land and we could claim each other as husband and wife. I still remember the date of our proposed wedding. It's been a year now since that date passed. The animalistic scratchings on the rocks around me remind me so every day. I shake off my thoughts and walk to the other end of the island, spear in my hand. I sing the same song to myself every time I go to hunt, either to keep my sanity or to provoke it's loss, I'm not sure. But between the words, I hear a faint clinking from the rocks nearby. A little sparkle of emerald shines against the grey stones and I walk over to investigate the noise. A bottle. The engraving on the side reads 100-years old, but I can tell from the familiarity of the letters, that 101 would be more accurate, by now, at least. Inside is a thin letter, dried with age, and even before prying it open I can tell what's written inside. \"You're late for our wedding.

Turning to face the starboard side of the ship , he unzipped his drawers and began to relieve himself from the side of the railing. I eased my way towards the feeding bottle , as quiet but quick as I could manage. Just as I took my last step to reach down for it , the gravy boat shook with a thunderous crash. I could hear steel bending , creak from the front of the ship. The horn of the ship boast three times. A rogue undulation. turd. I turned and made eye contact with the safeguard , who , was still mid-whiz but was now gripping onto the railing for his life. The ship bucked like a bull , throwing itself into the sky , and I was thrown from the spinal column , right between the railings and into the water. I struggled to stay afloat , and between the battering of the waves , I could hear my fiance ' screaming , and the trump of the boat growing further and further away. I had woken up on this pitifully small island , the feeding bottle of wine I `` rescued '' just inches from myself , half-filled with sand-muddled seawater. I give birth waited two months on that ship , counting down for the moment it would land and we could claim each other as husband and wife. I still remember the date of our pop the question wedding. It 's been a year now since that particular date passed. The animalistic scratchings on the stone around me remind me so every day. I shake off my thoughts and walk to the other end of the island , spear in my mitt. I sing the same sung dynasty to myself every time I go to hunt , either to keep my sanity or to provoke it 's loss , I 'm not sure. But between the words , I hear a faint clinking from the john rock nearby. A little sparkle of emerald shines against the grey harlan stone and I walk over to investigate the noise. A nursing bottle. The engraving on the side reads 100-years honest to god , but I can tell from the familiarity of the letters , that 101 would be more accurate , by now , at least. Inside is a thin letter , dried with age , and still before prying it open I can tell what 's written inside. `` You 're late for our marriage ceremony. Hurry back home to me , or my beginner will kill you. ``", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "\"You have talent, son,\" Stefan's father growled. \"You can be our family's next practitioner. And you're ready to toss it away? To move to America and sing COUNTRY music?\" Erik Dahl towered over his son, scowling as he gripped his guitar with one hand. Stefan knew his father was only minutes away from breaking out into a Solo. He shoved his hands in his pockets so Erik wouldn't see them trembling. \"I just want to..... explore, I guess. I like other things than Metal, dad! Is that so terrible?\" \"Yes, since you ask. It's sacrilege. There's a reason Metal reigns supreme,\" Erik snapped. \"And I'll be damned if a son of mine tosses his gift away, the hold you could have over life and death itself! For country music magic. When you have the power to turn lyrics into reality, you don't choose to sing about unrequited love and roadtrips!

Why is it so wrong to practice more than one style of music?\" \"It's unnatural. You were born a Metal practitioner, and that's that. My word is final, son,\" Erik said. He grabbed Stefan's hands roughly and handcuffed him. That way, Stefan wouldn't be able to play guitar and do anything drastic for the time being. He swept from the room and slammed the door shut, locking it behind him. Stefan was just relieved Erik hadn't subdued him with his latest song: Obedience until Death. He didn't think the title was coincidental. Stefan sat down on his bed, glumly considering Plan B. It would take some doing, but it might just be crazy enough to work. Not being able to play guitar could be a problem, though. He'd need some help. He took a deep breath and dialled the number on his phone, struggling a bit with his tied-up hands. The number of the girl he couldn't stop thinking about. They'd seen one another's music videos, the typical way these things started. The pull she had over him was magnetic. One could even say magical. It rang three times before she picked up. \"Taylor,\" he whispered, so his dad couldn't hear him. \"I need your help.\" He explained what he needed, and put the phone on loudspeaker. Two voices were always better than one. \"Shake it off! Shake it off!\" he growled along to her sweeping vocals. Soon, the cuffs fell from his hands. He picked up the phone. \"Okay, I've got an idea for getting to you, babe,\" he said, glancing at the door. His dad could hear him at any moment. They'd need to sing quickly. \"We'll need to give the best performance of our lives, though. My dad could hear us and start singing himself. I need to teleport to your side. It's my Wildest Dream, actually.\" \"Well, it helps that you're tall and handsome as hell,\" she chuckled. \"Let's do it. I really think we have a chance. Country Metal will rule the world yet, mark my words.\" He started singing along with her. By the time Erik broke through the door, it was too late. The Metal kingdom's heir was gone. \"Nooooo!\" he let loose a guttural howl. He gritted his teeth and fingered his guitar's strings. He wouldn't see the power of Metal disgraced like this. He had a few tricks up his sleeves. He'd secretly been working on this new song ever since the boy had first spoken of his perverse interests. Prolicide Songs were almost unheard of - but he was Erik Dahl. He dared where others shrank back in horror. And it would be such a Metal thing to do. He could always have more sons, anyway. \"And the son shall writhe in PAIN! \" he began screaming, shredding his way through the riffs. \"For betrayal will be paid for in BLOOD! Maggots shall feast on his eyes, He will scream as he's ground into the mud! And Country will weep at the sound of his cries. But none will be able to do anything, His spasming body will be out of their reach, He will choke on his own blood as he tries to sing, But in vain, for now he's food for a leech, And it will start with his heart twisting in pain. The torture and terror will drive him insane. If only he'd stuck to metal and listened to his father, But no, now he'll just be a cadaver. DIE! EFFIN' STEFAN! DIIIIIIEEEE! \" In America, Stefan felt a sharp, lancing pain in his chest. \"Oh no,\" he breathed. \"I think my dad's trying to kill me.\" Taylor's lips trembled. \"Don't say it,\" he warned, while trying to think of a song to counter his father's music. \"I guess you got bad blood,\" she sniggered. \"Sorry, couldn't resist.

You disgust me. `` `` That was just an example of what I 'd like to explore , '' Stefan sighed , regretting the day he 'd first mentioned the ' blow ' word. `` C'mon , dad. Why is it thence wrong to practice more than one style of music ? '' `` It 's unnatural. You were born a Metal practician , and that 's that. My word be final , son , '' Erik said. He grabbed Stefan 's hands more or less and handcuffed him. That way , Stefan would n't be able to play guitar and exercise anything drastic for the time being. He swept from the room and slammed the door shut , shut up it behind him. Stefan was just relieved Erik had n't subdued him with his latest birdsong : Obedience until Death. He did n't cerebrate the title was coincidental. Stefan sat down on his bottom , glumly considering Plan B. It would take some doing , but it might just be crazy enough to make. Not constitute able to play guitar could be a problem , though. He 'd need some help. He took a deep breath and dialled the identification number on his phone , struggling a bit with his tied-up hands. The number of the girl he could n't stop reckon about. They 'd learn one another 's music videos , the typical way these things started. The pull she had over him was charismatic. One could even articulate magical. It rang three fourth dimension before she picked up. `` Taylor , '' he whispered , so his papa could n't hear him. `` I demand your help. `` He explained what he take , and put the phone on loudspeaker. Two voices personify always better than one. `` throw off it off ! throw off it off ! '' he growled along to her sweeping vocals. before long , the cuffs fell from his hands. He picked up the speech sound. `` Okay , I 've stupefy an idea for getting to you , babe , '' he said , glancing at the door. His pa could hear him at any moment. They 'd ask to sing quickly. `` We 'll need to give the effective performance of our lives , though. My dad could get wind us and start singing himself. I need to teleport to your side. It 's my Wildest Dream , actually. `` `` Well , it helps that you 're tall and handsome as hell , '' she laugh softly. `` allow 's do it. I actually think we have a chance. Country Metal will rule the world yet , mark my quarrel. `` He started babble out along with her. By the time Erik broke through the door , it was likewise late. The metallic element kingdom 's heir was gone. `` Nooooo ! '' he let loose a croaky howl. He grit his teeth and fingered his guitar 's strings. He would n't come across the power of Metal disgraced like this. He had a few prank up his sleeves. He 'd secretly been working on this new song ever since the male child had first spoken of his perverse interests. Prolicide Songs constitute almost unheard of - but he was Erik Dahl. He dared where others shrank back in horror. And it would be such a metallic thing to do. He could always have more than sons , anyway. `` And the son shall writhe in PAIN ! `` he began screaming , shred his way through the riffs. `` For betrayal leave be paid for in BLOOD ! Maggots shall feast on his eyes , He leave scream as he 's ground into the mud ! And Country leave weep at the sound of his cries. But none leave be able to do anything , His spasming body leave be out of their reach , He leave choke on his own blood as he tries to sing , But in vain , for now he 's food for a leech , And it leave start with his heart twisting in pain. The torture and terror will repel him insane. If only he 'd stuck to metal and listened to his father god , But no , now he 'll just be a cadaver. die ! EFFIN ' STEFAN ! DIIIIIIEEEE ! `` In America , Stefan felt a sharp , lancing pain in his chest. `` Oh no , '' he catch ones breath. `` I think my dad 's trying to vote down me. `` Taylor 's lips tremble. `` Do n't say it , '' he warned , while try on to think of a song to counter his father 's music. `` I guess you got spoiled blood , '' she sniggered. `` Sorry , could n't resist. Okay , how can I help ? ''", "label": 1}

After I manage to croak something unintelligible out, he tells me that one of my \"victims\" was his son. His son is a physics grad student at my school. I beat him up, and he bombed a big test afterward. His father holds me personally responsible for that.

I 'm pretty drugged up , but I manage to make out that I ingest several broken ribs , and my face is in pretty rough shape. Also lots of soft tissue legal injury. I 'll exist here for weeks. That 's not yet the best part , though. You know what the best part be ? This old asian guy comes in and sits down next to me. He barely stares at me for like an hour. After I manage to croak something unintelligible out , he tells me that one of my `` victim '' was his son. His son is a physics grad educatee at my school. I beat him up , and he flunk a big test afterward. His begetter holds me personally responsible for that. So he paid the promoter to set me up and frame me up against a real MMA fighter to teach me a lesson. He made sure I would get beat up bad enough to miss my exams later this calendar month. heart for an eye. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "The Pull engines began to wind down, and Phlan felt slightly nauseous as the pull of natural gravity began to tug on him. After years of travelling, they had finally decelerated enough to be on the home stretch of their journey. The bridge was dark, as it always was after a Pull jump, and Phlan could hardly contain his excitement as he waited for the reactor to build up enough charge to restart non-vital systems, and the view screens that would tell them their journey would be worth it. \"I bet it's almost completely filled with silicon. Silicon and Iron.\" Yane said, peering over his dead navigation screen. \"The scanner said it had oceans. Oceans mean sand, right? Sand and silicon? And the other planet kinda looked reddish, so iron should be abundant here, right?\" Phlan sighed, \"Yeah, but that doesn't mean the atmosphere isn't made up completely of Carbon Monoxide. We'll find out once we reboot.\" \"Yeah..... You're right. But that would be great. Think of all the things we could make without having to refurbish everything. A whole planet that we could build with...\" Phlan nodded. He couldn't argue with the fact that having to do daily scrap runs to the reactor was getting tedious, especially after Flim accidentally hit the vent button on the launch bay that was being used as temporary storage while the bay was getting cleaned during the calibration stop. A loss that the entire colony still felt raw from, even after sending Flim to a similar demise. A wave of nausea rushed through Phlan again, and he wondered if he still felt he was too harsh on the poor janitor, before a beeping noise reminded him that the artificial gravity had just been started. \"The screens! The screens are coming up!\" Exclaimed Yane, who would have jumped out of his seat, had he not still been buckled in for the jump in. \"I see...... Dust. Craters. More dust. Oh, god, it looks nothing like the scans! There's nothing there! Where's the water? The rocks? The sand!? There's not even an atmosphere! Is there nothing left!?\" \"Shut up, moron. You're looking at the moon.\" \"Oh.\" Phlan tapped his video screen, and as he did, the walls of the bridge flickered, bringing up a complete view of the space around them. Directly to the front was the bright side of the pale, gray moon, still and foreboding. The pull jump was supposed to land them between the sun and the planet, which it did very well. The problem was, nobody knew where the moon would be, so the programmers plotted a spot that would be just outside the moons estimated orbit. Phlan thanked this rare sense of foresight. Dropping out of a jump pull in the middle of a moon was not what he had planned on doing today. \"We're going to have to wait. Reactor is still on cooldown. Thrusters will be down until we can check the system integrity.\" Yane let out a long sigh, followed by a sharp inhale. \"You mean, we traveled faster, and farther, than anyone else, ever, testing new technology in a brand new class of ship, with the collective minds of the best command has to offer working behind it, landing precisely outside the gravity well at the perfect altitude, and we have to wait on the most important discovery of all time, because some pencil pusher doesn't want his office to get a little too hot?\" Phlan looked over to Yane. \"Breath. And yes, because,'a little too hot' is actually more like'hotter than the surface of a dwarf star'. I don't know about you, but I'd rather not be known as this centuries'that guy. \"Hrmph. Fine.\" - \"All systems go!\" Yane said with a squeal. \"Thrusters are active and responsive!\" \"Good. Put us in a prograde orbit around the moon. I wan na be able to get out if it turns out the planets actually a volcanite. I don't wan na get hit by a rogue magma spray,\" Phlan said to the giddy navigator, \"We'll do a quick orbit to see what we got.\" \"On it.\" A final pang of nausea hit him as the thrusters came online, forcing the entire ship to lurch softly. Slowly at first, the moon began to turn beneath them, but as the engines pushed the craft faster, Phlan caught himself holding his breath, staring at the horizon of the gray moon falling below them. Phlan felt a bit of nostalgia, as he remembered his first trip around their own moon. A trip that had began his entire career as a pilot, a captain, and ultimately, here. \"Be ready to make history. It has been an honor to work with you.\" Yane nodded, croaking out a dry, simple, \"Sir.\" The bridge was forbiddingly silent as the first hints of a blue crescent shone beyond the moon. The silence only lasted a moment, before the communication terminal's radio erupted in noise as it began to pick up a cacophony of signals, voices, and static. The noise caused both Phlan and Yane to jump. Radio waves. Life. Intelligent life! Phlan was about to call out for a programmer to start isolating signals for interpretation, when he found himself speechless. The view screen in front of him showed him a vast ocean, amazingly blue. Within it, a large island, tanned with sand, and a thin band of gray surrounding the coast. Phlan had to remind himself to breath before he spoke, ever so softly. \"Is that...\" Yane croaked, \"Oh..God...\" \"So..... it is?\" \"Uh...\" \"Yane!\" Phlan shouted. \"Would you like to tell me, why, after being stuck on a ship with you, for 23 years, and 15 lightyears, am I looking at fucking Australia!?\"", "text_perturb": "The Pull engines began to wind down , and Phlan felt slenderly nauseous as the pull of natural gravity began to tug on him.

A wave of nausea rushed through Phlan again , and he wondered if he still matt up he was too harsh on the poor janitor , before a beeping noise reminded him that the artificial gravity had just been started. `` The screens ! The screens are coming up ! '' Exclaimed Yane , who would have jumped out of his seat , own he not still been buckled in for the jump in. `` I run across. . . . . . junk. volcanic crater. More debris. Oh , idol , it looks nothing like the scans ! There 's nothing there ! Where 's the water ? The rocks ? The sand ! ? There 's not even an atmosphere ! Is there nothing left ! ? '' `` Shut up , moron. You 're bet at the moon. `` `` Oh. `` Phlan tapped his video screen , and as he did , the walls of the bridge flickered , bringing up a complete view of the distance around them. Directly to the front was the bright side of the pale , gray moonlight , still and foreboding. The pull jump was suppose to land them between the sun and the planet , which it did very well. The problem was , nobody knew where the moon would be , so the programmers plotted a spot that would be just outside the moons estimated sphere. Phlan thank this rare sense of foresight. Dropping out of a jump pull in the middle of a moon was not what he had be after on doing today. `` We 're kick the bucket to have to wait. reactor is still on cooldown. Thrusters will be down until we can check the arrangement integrity. `` Yane let out a tenacious sigh , followed by a sharp inhale. `` You mean , we traveled faster , and farther , than anyone else , ever , testing new technology in a brand new class of ship , with the collective minds of the best command has to offer working behind it , landing precisely outside the gravity well at the perfect altitude , and we have to wait on the most important discovery of all time , because some pencil pusher does n't want his office to get a little to a fault hot ? '' Phlan looked over to Yane. `` hint. And yes , because , ' a little besides hot ' is actually more like'hotter than the surface of a dwarf star '. I do n't know about you , but I 'd instead not be known as this centuries'that guy. `` Hrmph. fine. `` - `` All systems go ! '' Yane said with a squeal. `` Thrusters are participating and responsive ! '' `` Good. position us in a prograde orbit around the moon. I wan na be able bodied to get out if it turns out the planets actually a volcanite. I set n't wan na get hit by a rogue magma spray , '' Phlan said to the giddy navigator , `` We 'll set a quick orbit to see what we got. `` `` On it. `` A final pang of nausea hit him as the thrusters came online , forcing the entire ship to lurch gently. Slowly at first , the moon began to turn beneath them , but as the engines pushed the craft faster , Phlan caught himself holding his intimation , staring at the horizon of the gray moon falling below them. Phlan felt a bit of nostalgia , as he think back his first trip around their own moon. A trip that had began his entire career as a pilot , a captain , and at last , here. `` exist ready to make history. It take in been an honor to work with you. `` Yane nodded , gnarl out a dry , simple , `` Sir. `` The bridge was forbiddingly silent as the first hints of a puritanical crescent shone beyond the moon. The silence only lasted a moment , before the communicating terminal 's radio erupted in noise as it began to pick up a cacophony of signals , voices , and static. The noise caused both Phlan and Yane to jump. radio set waves. life. Intelligent animation ! Phlan was about to call out for a programmer to start isolating signals for interpretation , when he found himself speechless. The view screen in front of him showed him a vast sea , amazingly blue. Within it , a large island , tanned with grit , and a thin band of gray surrounding the coast. Phlan had to remind himself to breath before he mouth , ever so softly. `` constitute that. . . `` Yane pass away , `` Oh. . divinity. . . `` `` thus. . . . . it constitute ? '' `` Uh. . . `` `` Yane ! '' Phlan shout out. `` Would you like to tell me , why , after being stuck on a ship with you , for 23 geezerhood , and 15 lightyears , am I looking at fucking Australia ! ? ''", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "\"This is a rather strange feeling, I must confess. I never knew you. I didn't even know you existed until a week ago, and since then I have felt nothing but guilt. It has been almost exactly seven days since I received a phone call from an old friend from high school. Well. An old girl friend. I loved her for the longest time. I hated her for a long time too. After dating for nearly three years, she simply disappeared. Her family moved, she was gone. She never told me why. I suppose you would be the reason for that. You were a cute kid. She sent me some of the baby pictures. You looked so happy. But I fear that the sadness I saw growing with every picture, as you got older and older isn't just in my head. It's real, and I fear that I am the cause. Or rather the lack of me. I don't know why I'm writing this letter. I don't know you, you don't know me. I am just a stranger, perhaps someone you even hate. But, I don't think I can accept that. I can't accept you hating me. I was terrified as the call grew on, and everything fit into place.

It hung over the edge like a drunk girl at a frat party. I remember a brief flash of panic - I was already running late because I forgot I had to get to work early today and I didn't have time for a major mess. But there was no mess. I reached over and very gently pulled the cup back on the table. I kept thinking about the cup all morning on my drive to work. To be honest, it was all I could think about most of the morning.

I check it out. Some old lady in Dubuque who fancied herself a bit of a fortune teller thought something bad was going to happen. So she follows her gut and finds some high school kid with an arsenal ready to lay waste to his entire class. She talked him down and called the cops. He was taken in for psych eval and she was praised as a hero. She claimed it was her \"gift.\" That night another story popped up just after I'd put the kids to bed. My wife handed me her phone with a \"Look at this.\" A guy in Japan had claimed to have talked directly with an ancient ancestor overnight. Normally everyone ignores those crackpot stories - but this guy got some highly detailed information. Specifically where a large cache of ancient weapons had been stored (some cave or something, I think). He had found out some more stuff about ancient battles and they were talking about contacting some archaeologists to look into. Of course, the guy also found out that his wife was cheating on him. I guess the old ghost was kind of a perv and liked to watch. By the following morning, it was harder to rationalize the news stories and even things we were seeing in out everyday life. The kids woke up and found the tooth fairy sitting at the end of the bed. They freaked out and I ended up taking a swing at the little pixie with a nine iron. Not my proudest moment. She left and we all decided to take the day off. The lead story on the news were those damn bunnies. The Large Hadron Collider was running some experiment to find some sort of tiny little particle, as they do. One of the science journalists described it as trying to pull a rabbit out of a hat. They fired up the LHC and something wasn't right. When they opened up the machine to figure out what was wrong, several dozen bunnies came tumbling out. The scientists tried to claim it was just some wildlife that burrowed in. But really - what the hell kind of rabbits burrow 100 meters underground? There was the lady in Brazil who claimed to have conjured a vengeful Amazonian spirit who was attacking logging crews. Nobody saw the spirit but something definitely happened to toss those bulldozers a quarter mile. Some people decided this would be a good time to go crazy.

{"original_text": "Here ] (https: ) is my story from a very similar prompt. This will be told from the antagonist's perspective) \"Matriarch,\" The Aresian lieutenant began, \"The remainder of the Libran fleet are in defensive formation within their closest moon's orbit. There is also a single ship of unknown design, roughly the size of our dreadnaught, outside that moon's orbit between us and the planet.\" The ship was very plain, a large cylinder with the ring of a warp drive around the middle. No markings or decoration of any kind on the hull. \"Ma'am,\" The lieutenant continued, \"We are being hailed. Audio only.\" \"Surely to announce their surrender. Put them on!\" the matriarch ordered. A small hiss of static swept through the command deck before an artificial voice sounded, \"This is Axiom Alpha number 311312 of the Aresian Extermination Fleet. Surrender now and we guarantee the preservation of your mind state vectors.\" \"They must be joking,\" the matriarch exclaimed, \"put me through.\" \"You're on.\" the lieutenant said. \"Axiom Alpha, this is Matriarch Klaxxis of the Aresian Empire. Our glorious war against the Librans is nearing its end, and you have the gall to demand OUR surrender!\" she shouted, more as a statement than a question. Axiom Alpha responded, \"Please reconsider. Our predictions indicate a 75 to 90 death toll for your forces. Please allow us to take your mind states into custody, nobody has to die today.\" The matriarch's fury exploded and screamed her order, even over the open comms, \"Lieutenant, destroy that ship!\" The lieutenant relayed the order to the gunners, and the main gun on the Dreadnaught fired upon the plain cylinder. The shot collided with the other ship's hull, passing through completely. The ship did not explode, but the damage seemed significant. The command deck burst into cheering at the demonstration of their might. \"Understood. May whatever gods you believe in have mercy on us all.\" Axiom Alpha responded over the open channel. \"Ma'am!\" The lieutenant exclaimed, \"They're launching missiles!\" \"What?!\" The matriarch, skittered over to the lieutenant's console, \"How many?\" \"Umm, at least two thousand.\" One might have heard a pin drop. Two thousand missiles..... There were only a hundred ships in their victory fleet. \"Matriarch to fleet, defensive fire!\" As the missiles approached, each ship in the fleet activated anti-missile defenses and attempted to shoot down the approaching horde. It wasn't until the cloud of missiles neared the defensive fields of fire, that the Aresians noticed something wrong. The cloud of missiles turned, and avoided the obvious defensive fire. Single missiles would separate from the cloud and dart in, provoking multiple shots before darting back out of range. Occasionally, a group of five would make an attempt at approaching a single ship. Most of the time the defensive fire took them out, but at least twice, the missiles broke through, and collided with the ships. \"Destroy them!\" The matriarch screamed. \"Our large guns are ineffective, they keep weaving between the fields of fire, and the main guns won't hit something that small.\" The matriarch looked back towards the screens, some realization dawning on her, \"They're not missiles, they're drones. The main ship is still controlling them. Destroy it!\" No sooner was the order given than the main guns turned back towards the drone carrier and opened fire. Heavy impacts broke through the hull, tearing the ship into pieces. But the drones still swarmed, with no change to the swarm's tactics. Frustrated, the matriarch continued ordering for countermeasures. ECM proved ineffective as the ships seemed to be using short range communication and relaying orders around. Grouping the ships closer to share defensive missile fire also proved ineffective. After a few minutes, several of the fleets ships went from drone impacts. \"What happened?!\" The matriarch shouted. \"I..... I don't know..... They were firing their defensive spread, then groups of the drones darted in and hit home.\" \"What is going on?!\" The matriarch's frustrations compounded on one another. \"Ma'am,\" The lieutenant began, \"Several ships are reporting the drones are darting in during gaps from reloading the defensive guns.\" A horrible thought occurred to the matriarch at this time, \"They're learning?!\" There was no greater feat for a military commander to learn and understand their foe, especially during the heat of battle. These were mere machines though, no living thing could withstand the accelerations the drones were displaying. How could they learn? Dozens more ships exploded across the fleet as the swarm became more and more effective at timing their attacks. Ships were starting to run out of defensive ammunition, and fell easily to the swarm. After fifty ships had been destroyed, the swarm had lost a mere two hundred drones. With a frustrated growl, the Matriarch ordered, \"All ships, withdraw!\" The swarm reacted immediately as the fleet attempted to withdraw. Several more ships were destroyed by their darting attacks, where the rest of the swarm circled the fleet, spreading out but keeping several drones in the path of each ship. \"I don't care how many of those drones you must crush beneath our hull, engage warp and get us out of here!\" The dreadnaught lurched forward as the warp engaged. Impacts with the drones could be felt on the hull as the dreadnaught simply pushed through. Of the 100 ships in the victory fleet, only 38 remained. The problems for the fleet did not end at their crushing defeat however. System failures across the fleet started occuring hours after they engaged warp. Ships were found to have their hulls and superstructures dissolving into grey goo. Engines overloaded, destroying ship and crew alike. The crew of the dreadnaught found themselves cutting away massive sections of the superstructure to remove the contagion. Only six ships arrived at their retreat point two days later, only to find their forward base completely annihilated. The blue star of the system was gone, replaced by a stream of super-hot plasma streching several hundred million kilometers away from the orbital plane. Planet orbits were already disrupted, being flung into interstellar space. No military signals could be found. The fleet continued on, heading straight for the Aresian homeworld. It would be a long trek, twelve days at full speed, but they would arrive in time for the defense of the system. Over those twelve days, two more ships were lost due to engine failures. The matriarch could not help but remember what Axiom Alpha had said. 90 death rate. What greeted the victory fleet on arrival at the Aresian homeworld filled the matriarch with despair. The planet had been bombarded, and huge swaths of the grey goo smeared across the continents and oceans of her world. Completely visible from space. In orbit around each planet in the system was a drone swarm, several thousand times larger than the one they fought on the Libran's doorstep. Several hundred thousand left orbit to intercept the battered fleet. \"Ma'am,\" the lieutenant began, \"We're being hailed.\" The matriarch, thoroughly defeated, told the lieutenant to put them through. \"This is Axiom Alpha number 214490, requesting the immediate surrender of the Aresian Victory fleet.

He blamed most of it on sex, the Shifters had nothing like it, every twenty years two Shifters would just get in a tub and liquify themselves in a tub and mix chemicals and a new Shifter would be formed from the process, it was cold and clinical, nothing like the intense passion of human breeding. Bob grabbed the folder, looked at the cheating wife and the addresses to find her at and went to work. He'd found emotions in himself in the years of working as a private eye, there was a thrill of the chase that he found delightful. That same rush hit him when he finally laid eyes on the target as she was walking down a crowded city road.

{"original_text": "As a cat, sort of, fabric-and-stitching construct in a human gait, I find myself sauntering around ordinary people whose heads swivel and eyes bugger, breaking into eager whispers. Look, don't worry about those things, I say - it's complicated, unlike the warlock tailor I answer to. I sweep back black bangs and pout at another barista for ruining a cheese-mouse dish I supplied the third mouse for today, sipping a tall, frothy mug of milk. I'm on tour to find Master Akira a foreign fashion designer, and I stopped by London presuming somebody remembered how to stitch Victorian, or Age of Sail pirate styles. The cafe has several prominent members of the fashion community chatting about market trends, but their interest is much more modern than Akira's, and a few of them have never held a needle in their life. I was still figuring out how to approach the table - without meeting their questions about cloth golem animation or hunting that rat down the hole - when a man in a hideously stitched suit pressed his way through the crowd. I afford him a sneer for the \"machine stitching\" come undone at the cuffs and lapels, but refuse to offer accessory advice for someone who paired a divisive brown belt with a billowy suit shirt and pants a size wider, and a size shorter, than they ought - making him look shorter and fatter than his bunny toothed smile and his unkempt hair already did. I could practically hear his nose twitching, imagine the cottony fluff at his behind, courteously ignoring him to avoid rummaging through his hair for his long ears. He grabbed my arm. I looked at the human hand, curious. Did it taste fluffy? I started lifting my arm to get closer, but he grabbed the other, spinning me around to put my back to him. I leaned against his chest, offering a defensive purr despite the adorable cut lawn scent wisping over his skin. \"You're coming with me,\" He snarled, jostling me to stand on my own. I shrug. Master Akira knows I'll be back soon enough. He threw me in the back of one of those hideous carriages - a limo, I think? - and slammed the lid. I purred. I didn't actually need air or anything. Instead, I crawled around the space until I felt a good patch of warmth radiating beneath the floor, and knead the upholstery. The fabric was too short to work my claws in properly, with something hard underneath. I sit back, glaring at the spot. The limo jostles and rumbles, so I crouched down anyway. Then I flopped on my side, and fell asleep despite my deep displeasure with the surface texture. Mr. Bunny woke me by opening the lid. I blinked blearily at him, lift my shoulders a tad, and flop onto my other side, blocking some light with my arm. He grabs the scruff of my neck, and tosses me to the pavement. I stretched, but his shoe met my ribs; I hopped to stand, growling low, and he grabbed my neck again. I tried going limp at first. Sometimes it worked? But he brought me past a hedgerow, the birds were singing, and I could smell sweet, delicious flowers nearby! The garden's sights, the sounds, the smells, everything was wonderful, and I wanted to prance around celebrating this amazing delight - but Mr. Bunny had my neck, and my flailing accomplished nothing. A low growl ebbs from my throat. Short, fat, stupid Mr. Bunny probably didn't even taste good. A different man with a freshly tailored, modern day suit looking as sharp as his girth would permit, stood on the front step of the mansion. His neck scarf suitably curious and his socks matching the color scheme, I afford him a courtesy sniff, craning over to get a closer inspection. He smells sweaty and cigar tainted, with dog rub smeared on his legs. They're medium hair, brown and black wolf hounds, and he owns at least a dozen - what little grace he won with his fashion evaporated in his gross scent. \"I didn't believe it, when I heard,\" The lard tub rumbled, three rings glistening as he beckons Mr. Bunny closer. I find myself in arm's reach, but I retract my arms, unwilling to smudge up my kimono with anything so dogged. \"My little princess, Shana, draws pictures like you - says that's what she wants for a boyfriend. And now China has finally produced a catboy to suit its migh-nuh, ey?\" I scowl. In Japanese, I explain, \"Master Akira does not trade in romantic partners, especially not me. But, even if you could afford my Lord's astronomical demands, I would barely stay a heartbeat in this abject squalor. \" The dogroll nods sagely, \"Ah, yes, and he speaks Chinese only. Naturally.\" I hiss, squirm, and fuss, but by the sparkle of shiny rings, Mr. Bunny and several associates joining him from around the manor provide escort to an upstairs bedroom. I provide clawing, leaving no seam untorn and no face unscratched, but alas, draped across Mr. Bunny's shoulder, I have arrived. They toss me inside and slam the door. Strangely, it is the first room I encountered that smells nothing of the dogs. Actually, I smell another cat around, and the perfume floating the air is a sakura based perfume. I flip onto my stomach, looking around the vast bedchamber. She has a luxuriously oversized bed, wardrobes and bookshelves on every inch of wall, several chests, and sits beside a low tea table with several stuffed animals. Her servant pours her cup, and I notice the raising of the pinkie and the bow to honor the tea before she accepts the first sip. I climb to my paws and saunter across the room, tilting my head. She's seated politely, too, brown hair combed into a simple ponytail. \"Do you know anything about fashion?\" I ask, allowing my gaze to wander her seated guests. Her teddy bears favored top hats and monocles, her unicorn a tricorn hat; the dragon wore a red bandanna across one eye, a heavily buttoned coat and fancy cuffs over a series of belts both fabulously diagonal and sashaying across his wide hips to slim his potbelly figure. The glimmer in her eyes betrays her before she leaps to her feet and attempts a string of novice Japanese. Her accent is too severe to decipher. I smile and pick up the dragon, tucking him into my sleeve, then a teddy bear in a good suit. She holds my hand and jibbers excitedly. \"Master Akira would like to have another tailor around. Interested?\" I grin so hard I start to worry about ripping the stitches on my face, but she does her best to match. \"Hai!\" I nod. After Mr. Bunny's manners (and unpleasant jerky-like taste), I feel a little justified conducting a kidnapping of my own. And it wasn't even the deed itself - but that he wouldn't let me play in the garden! Hrmph. I hand her the teddy bear. \"Hold this?\" She giggles, taking the bear and hugging him to her chest. I loop one arm behind her shoulder, the other her knees, and sweep her off her feet. \"Bit of a jump home. Don't fall!\" Without further ado, I carry her to the window, and spring down to the hedge. She lurches against my chest, pressing the bear between us. \"You're cute,\" Shana smiles, hand wrapped around my neck. \"But where are we really going?\" My shoulders lift. She lifts with my arms, and takes the moment to snog my face. \"Where else? \" An excited gasp lifts her eyebrows, drawing wide her face in a grin. I jump.", "text_perturb": "As a cat , sort of , fabric-and-stitching construct in a human gait , I find myself sauntering around ordinary mass whose heads swivel and eyes bugger , breaking into eager whispers. tone , do n't worry about those things , I say - it 's complicated , unlike the warlock tailor I answer to. I sweep back black bangs and eelpout at another barista for ruining a cheese-mouse dish I supplied the third mouse for today , sipping a tall , frothy mug of milk. I 'm on tour to find Master Akira a alien fashion designer , and I stopped by London presuming somebody remembered how to stitch Victorian , or Age of Sail pirate styles. The cafe has several prominent members of the fashion community chatting about market movement , but their interest is much more modern than Akira 's , and a few of them have never held a needle in their life. I was still figuring out how to approach the table - without meeting their questions about cloth golem animation or hunting that rat down the hole - when a valet in a hideously stitched suit pressed his way through the crowd. I afford him a sneer for the `` machine stitching '' come undone at the cuffs and lapels , but refuse to offer accessory advice for someone who paired a divisive brown belt with a billowy suit shirt and pants a size wider , and a size shorter , than they ought - making him depend shorter and fatter than his bunny toothed smile and his unkempt hair already did. I could much hear his nose twitching , imagine the cottony fluff at his behind , courteously ignoring him to avoid rummaging through his hair for his long ears. He grabbed my subdivision. I looked at the human manus , curious. Did it taste fluffy ? I started lifting my subdivision to get closer , but he grabbed the other , spinning me around to put my back to him. I leaned against his chest , offering a defensive purr despite the adorable cut lawn olfactory property wisping over his skin. `` You 're coming with me , '' He snarled , jostling me to stand on my ain. I shrug. Master Akira knows I 'll be back soon enough. He threw me in the back of one of those hideous carriages - a limo , I think ? - and bang the lid. I whiz. I did n't actually necessitate air or anything. Instead , I crawled around the space until I mat a good patch of warmth radiating beneath the floor , and knead the upholstery. The fabric was too unretentive to work my claws in properly , with something hard underneath. I sit backward , glaring at the spot. The limo jostles and rumbles , so I bow down anyway. Then I flopped on my english , and fell asleep despite my deep displeasure with the surface texture. mister. bunny girl woke me by opening the lid. I blinked blearily at him , rustle my shoulders a tad , and flop onto my other side , blocking some light with my arm. He grab the scruff of my neck , and tosses me to the pavement.

{"original_text": "Well, today started out like any other. I was awoken by my alarm clock at about seven a'clock in the morning. When I opened my eyes, I could see that two robots were fighting to the death about two feet away from my bed. They did so silently, probably so that they would not wake me up too early, but when one of them, a short machine that looked like the robots from Terminator except it was a pearl white, noticed that I had woken up, pulled out his laser pistol and sent off a blast that destroyed the other robot's skull. I watched for a second, wondering how long they had fought and how long they had been in my house before realizing that I really did not care. I got up from my bed and started to get ready for school. As I did so, the robot politely excused himself and left. My entire kitchen area was torn apart, either from the dueling robots or from my roommate who got high the night before. The smell in the room was an odd combination of marijuana and burning metal from the robot skull. The front door to our house was full of bullet-holes, which robots had shot up last week during class. Their target? Our toaster. Just the toaster, not our fridge or television.

For some reason, they either hate toasters, or they are convinced that toasters are participating in this war.

While I started the short drive down to my college, I noticed a flock of robot-geese flew over my truck as they shot lasers out of their eyes at unoccupied buildings and robots the size of buildings. Damn, why was traffic going so slow today?! A loud, crackling sound filled the air. I looked back toward the robo-geese to see that a small, monkey-like robot had grabbed one out of the air and was ripping it apart as it got lasered by its friends. I turned my radio on at full volume. My phone began to ring, I noticed it was my girlfriend. I began trying to talk to her, but the war outside was just too loud. I had to ask her to talk to me later. When I had finally gotten to class, I could see that bits of the buildings were now scattered along the fields around the University. Almost immediately, I visited one of my professors and began to talk. \"So, what do you think of my essay?\" I asked doctor Treskey. \"Well, it's fine. Of course, there are a few problems that you will see in the grade, but I'm sure you will fix it.\" He told me. In reality, my essay sucked. Badly. Yet, for some reason, the guy had always taken a shining to me. That is why professor Treskey was my favorite professor. Notice how I said, \"was\" my favorite professor. Suddenly, a giant, brick-covered tentacle reached out from behind me and grabbed Treskey. He screamed as the tentacle squeezed tighter, then tighter.

{"original_text": "\"What a long exhausting day it was!\" - I thought to myself, looking at the still blurred from the shower steam silhouette in the mirror. Signing books has always been my no Go when it comes to meet with my audience. I prefer the readers' questions via e-mail or post. Alas, when I was signing the six figures contract I wasn't thinking of THAT at all. I stepped into the bedroom, found some clothes on the bed and put them on. Now, when I washed the day off my body and mind, it was time for something more pleasant - my new, but unfortunately to all of my readers, last book. The big boom that nobody expects. I grabbed a bottle of my favorite beer and sat on my desk. Fired up this old PC of mine, double-clicked on the File. Page 116. Wait, 116??? That's not right. I'm sure I left at page 23 yesterday. I scrolled down to page 23. Yep, there it was. The line I left my book at yesterday. So how the hell have all those 93 pages written themselves? In one day??? I gazed with a grimed look at my beer. \"Nah, it can't be.\" - I said out loud. I never drink more than 3 bottles! It is absurd. Unless. \"Unless someone sneaked in my room and poured something in it.\" - another cry out loud in my room. So I decided to put the beer aside, just in case, and check on those 93!!! pages. Jonathan was walking carefully down the icy street. It was still dark, although the big tower watch was showing 7:00 in the morning, and he was trying not to fall. Damn winter, he thought to himself. The coffee shop was just around the corner, but it felt like million miles away. Jenny's coffee was his destination, before of course arriving at work. A freshly brewed cup of coffee. He could smell it already. And the melodic voice of Jenny. Every time Jenny reaches to hand Johnathan his coffee there is this spark that can be seen, flashing between them..... What??? They never had a spark!!! This, what I read, is just ridiculous. Jenny and John. Yeah, sure, like Bonnie and Clyde. There was never anything between them! No, no, let me see further. I skipped 40 or 60 pages, who the hell counts. Jenny and John, haha. It was the special night of the year. The Christmas party at Johnathan's company. Everyone had an invitation card with a 1 on it. Be it a girlfriend, boyfriend or just a lover. Of course, since Jonathan was married, he couldn't invite Jenny to the party. And because of his boss, who was some kind of moralist he had to ask his best friend at the company - Matt, to invite her. This way, Johnathan would at least have the chance to look at Jenny and perhaps during the night, have a dance with her. Matt, on the other hand, was this awesome good-looking guy. There was no female (even some male) coworkers in the office who had a crush on him. Ahahaha, I just couldn't stop laughing. Matt - awesome good-looking guy? I was really starting to believe that my book or someone, who wrote this, had some twisted mind. Some completely and totally twisted mind than what was the actual plot I was writing. Matt is the bad guy. The one, that no one likes. Let me scroll to see..... Wait. Now there are 146 pages already??? How long have I been reading this? I scrolled lighting fast down to the very bottom of the document. And then I saw it. The cursor was moving by itself. My hands - away from the keyboard. And yet, letters which formed words were coming underneath the cursor. But there, at the Christmas party, there was one person that everyone hated. And they were waiting for their chance.

{"original_text": "I sat there, staring at the clock, waiting for the clock the hit 18:56- the exact time of my birth. On my lap sat a phone, my phone to be exact, open to a text conversation with my crush, asking her about the process of getting her powers (Pyrokinesis), which she assured me was completely painless. She did, of course, have to wait a few weeks for her eyebrows to grow back in, but that was beside the point. I looked at the clock, 18:55. Then, after what seemed an eternity (really only 5 seconds), the clock struck 18:56. I looked around the room and at myself. I certainly didn't feel any different, I didn't look different, and after a few hundred attempts, I was forced to admit that I couldn't control a thing or anyone. As a last ditch attempt, I shot Suzanne a quick photo with the caption'Any different'? She quickly replied back,'Not that I can see. What'd you get?' 'IDK' I responded, crawling into bed, crying softly into my pillows. The next day, I was woken by a loud rapping noise on my window, and the bkices of a thousand men.

On my lap sat a speech sound , my speech sound to be exact , open to a text conversation with my crush , asking her about the process of getting her powers ( Pyrokinesis ) , which she assured me was completely painless. She did , of course , give birth to wait a few weeks for her eyebrows to grow back in , but that was beside the point. I look at the clock , 18:55. Then , after what seemed an eternity ( really only 5 secondment ) , the clock struck 18:56. I looked around the way and at myself. I certainly did n't finger any different , I did n't look different , and after a few hundred attempts , I was forced to admit that I could n't control a thing or anyone. As a last ditch attempt , I shot Suzanne a quick picture with the caption'Any different ' ? She quickly replied back , 'Not that I can see. What 'd you get ? ' 'IDK ' I responded , crawling into bed , crying softly into my pillow. The next day , I was woken by a loud rapping noise on my windowpane , and the bkices of a thousand men.

A few weeks later, all you had to do was look up late in the afternoon, while you were coming back from work, that is, if you were one of the people who stuck to old habits. I remember the incredulity we all felt when we were told that the new celestial body, ushered overnight into our solar system by a wave of radiation, was Earth. Not our Earth, but another one precisely like ours. They called the whole thing a wormhole. I don't know what that is, and didn't intend or pretend to. I also remember the panic and hysteria when we were told that the other Earth was headed straight towards us. For what it's worth, this seemed like the sort of thing we needed.

The other Earth was dead silent. Their lights were out. As far as we could see, there was nobody home. But... what if? We puzzled it out. We discussed. Some of us raised their voices. Others raised their guns. In the end, most of us took votes. Do we nuke our way through? Is there anybody alive out there? If so, do we nuke our way through, anyway? While we were busy deciding, their lights went on. And with the lights, came their voices. Our own voices. The wormhole-thing they went through had killed their electronics and their power sources.

Most had no way of even knowing what had just happened to their planet. When their radios, phones and televisions started working again, they were greeted by disturbing news.

It was a beautiful, terrifying blue hour, an ominous presence like that of a god, quietly floating, always watching, coming ever closer.

The Quad-Amputation from four months ago. As with anything decent enough to be called a sport, there were golden moments. These moments hung in the Gall of Fame. Last month, he took his wife and kids there for Mikey's 10th birthday to see the pictures, records and memorials. She left with the kids two weeks later. Cleared his account. Sold the property. Because I could, was all the note said. Marga bled him dry. The brutality of it left Sang with nothing. Except the Blood Games. Now he sat strapped to a back-alley doctor's chair. A small camera sat above the room, actively broadcasting the operating room to some random corner of the internet. Any sport without a pre-show wasn't one worth watching. However, this doctor wasn't like the Masters of Ceremony on prime time. He was an amateur who stuttered, and cackled, and waved his knives and syringes for the camera. As desperate for the viewer numbers on his internet channel to climb as Sang was for his blood points. It was a perfect match. \"What'll it be,\" the doctor asked earlier. A flesh eating bacteria to let sit for a few months? Blood loss? How are we playing today? The doctor laughed some more for his viewers. Sang whimpered like a bitch, with his wrists strapped down awful tight. The struggle once entertained him before on the other end. Made it feel authentic.

Best flush out those tears, rattle those straps and howl under the floodlight. This was a show after all, and the doctor's channel was probably a small one before tonight. Maybe Sang will be dead enough inside later to take anything. Make me rich. It was a bleeder. A body tragedy and rescue within a few minute span. The perfect show.

{"original_text": "\"Wires?\" I thought aloud, although in a hushed tones between shallow gasps. I still didn't handle blood well but the shock of seeing..... wires deep under my skin kept me grudgingly lucid. The cut was on the top of my hand, a couple inches below my two leftmost knuckles. Wires, that word filled my mind quicker than any every had. A seed really, sprouting questions whose fruits were doubt, filling up my still cloudy mind. The outrageous and the impossible are present even among the most rationale people. The next few minutes saw me doubting myself as either of those things. Of one of those two things I was wrong to doubt. One wire protruded significantly more than the rest, drooping and surprisingly spindly. At this point the word \"wire\" flowed freely as if I had already accepted it. I gently touched the end, apprehensive but of what? Pain? An electrical shock? More likely it was the admission somewhere just under my conscious surface that I had accepted suck a ridiculous idea. I pulled at the the wire, it stretched slightly but moved no more than that. The pain was excruciating. I was not human. it was a ridiculous thought but in the few minutes I sat there feeling the pain run up my arm in a single pulsing surge it actually comforted me. It all made sense now, why I couldn't laugh and experience joy as sincerely as everyone else. It wasn't my fault. I pulled harder and pieces fell off onto the floor beside me. Something shifted and I could feel my arm lose its grip on this secret that I had every right to know. God the pain was intense! But it wasn't going to stop me. I needed more proof, more justification that all those little things which plagued me for years finally had an explanation. I knew I was a little weird, a little anti-social. The only empathy I've ever displayed has been fake, I always knew that. But I'm not even human? Fuck they didn't hold back on pain capacity. What a waste. Me an Android. A pathetic mess, no ambition or purpose. Why make something like that, like me, if their life was meaningless? I stopped pulling. I had ripped out all I could from that arm. I took the knife that had slipped trying to open that ridiculously strong plastic package. Knocked the package to floor and sat down on couch. I could feel them in my face. When I pushed to the right of my nose I COULD FEEL THEM. They need to get out I need to know where they are, how they work. I clenched my eyes shut as hard as I was able and felt the drip of warm blood on my fingers before I had even known the knife sliced into my skin. THERE! I found the first end and pulled, gently at first. It was very small, almost delicate. It broke off. ANOTHER. There were so many more in my face than my arm. My body must be covered in them. Before long piles of shredded and broken wires laid around me. My eyes were filling with blood, touch became the only sense I cared about. Feeling my skin, dragging my fingers across my open flesh searching for more and more wires. Pain meant nothing anymore. What is pain to an android, a robot? I am sure I was unrecognizable. It occurred to me that even androids must rely on blood..... or whatever this fucking liquid that filled my vision was. How many wires have I pulled out now? How much robot is left, how much human? Or no..... I was never human I knew that now. There was never any to be left. I won. I can feel myself starting to shut down. What's the difference between this and turning off a TV. I was happy.

{"original_text": "\" Do you really think Earth is dead by now? \" I love Jenny, and I'm going to get to see her for the first time tomorrow because it's Mingling Day and we're both 16 now. We're going to have sex, and I'm going to try to get her pregnant. I even hope the baby is a girl so it can stay to live with her rather than coming over to me. However, I've learned this doesn't mean she never annoys me. \" I don't know. No one knows, not even the Vorn. \" \" Yeah, but my grandma says they were wrong. Humans weren't doomed to overpopulation and war. We can control our breeding with contraception or even just by avoiding sex even though when we're all mixed together. If that's true, then they didn't rescue us, they kidnapped us. \" \" My grandpa says the same thing, \" I agreed. I was mostly being diplomatic though. I thought the Vorn had probably been right, and human civilization on Earth had probably been doomed when they had first found us. It was true that humans, unlike the Vorn, didn't have to have sex just because we encountered a fertile female. However, it was also true that our females were always capable of sex, and most people would choose to have sex if they could. The population of Earth had certainly doubled in the four decades before they arrived. That didn't seem sustainable. \" Anyway, \" I told Jenny, \" here and now we live like they do- segregated. We're alive, and we're going to see each other tomorrow. That's all that really matters, right? \" Jenny sighed happily and that made any annoyance I still felt melt. \" You're right. OK, if we have a baby and it's a girl, what do you want to name it? \" \" I still think you're nuts to skip the orgies, \" Mike called over the noise of the bus. I looked out the window at the approaching Women's City. From the outside it didn't look like much. Just a giant circular wall rising from the lifeless plain of the planet the Vorn had dumped us on. Some people call our world Earth 2 or New Earth. Maybe that's an acceptable name, but the new world certainly isn't an improvement on the old one. Still, when the Vorn are convinced we're responsible about population they'll let us expand. We're doing well with that. Mingling Day is run by humans now, and humans punish anyone trying to city jump. There's talk the Vorn are going to let us have another couple of cities. Maybe they'll let us plant something as well. I looked back to Mike, \" If you have a son without a registered partnership then you don't get to keep him. The pop board will assign the child to the best adoptive parent. \" \" Kids are a lot of work, \" Mike countered. \" Everyone helps. You're just mad because you broke up with Ann. \" Mike folded his arms and turned back toward the front of the bus, suggesting I'd hit closer to the mark than I intended. It was just as well. By that time, our bus had reached the massive gate in the wall of the women's city and we both had better things to worry about. The day passed quickly, a little awkwardly, and pleasantly. In truth, I only remember the first half. On Mingling Day anyone is allowed to drink, and I didn't have the head for it because otherwise the minimum age is 18. Things get fuzzy around noon, and I think I passed out with Jenny in her bed at about 3. Still, before that everything was great. Afterword's, not so much. I woke up, groaned slightly, and rubbed by head. \" Ouch. I thought hangovers came the following morning. \" Jenny stirred beside me, waking up then sitting up. She looked like an angel. My headache faded somewhat, and I leaned over to kiss her. We'd gotten enough practice during the day that we were getting pretty good. The kissing lasted a few minutes before Jenny pushed me back. \" Do we have time? How long will you need to get back to your bus? \" I'd memorized that, \" Only 10 minutes. \" I looked around. It was dark except for the street lights coming through the window and the light that leaked under her bedroom door. \" What time is it anyway? \" Jenny fumbled a bit in the darkness pulling a piece of clothing off of her alarm clock. She gasped then showed it to me without saying anything. I heard myself gasp as well though I didn't consciously decide to make the sound. The clock read 3:13 a.m. \" That can't be right. \" \" I went around and set all the clocks yesterday. Nothing's more than a second off! \" \" But what about the sirens? I didn't hear anything! \" I fumbled through the darkness finding my pants and in them my phone. The phone agreed with the clock. \" Shit! I'm city jumping! The pop board is going to execute me. \" The Vorn hadn't done that, but the pop board was serious about getting those extra cities. They'd upped the penalties for illegal mingling. I was starting to freak out. Jenny grabbed me, \" Not if you get back to Men's City. \" \" How? \" \" Today is the best day for it. Everyone got the day off, everyone got drunk, no one would expect a city jumper three hours after Mingling Day ends. If anyone is watching the wall it's some granny too old to care about Mingling Day, and she'll probably be half blind. \" Jenny proved to be more or less correct. She was able to show me where to find a wall maintenance harness, and we were able to move around the city without anyone getting close enough to realize I was male. I texted Mike to hang a rope over the Men's City wall, and miraculously, he wasn't too drunk to get the text, so I had a route back into the Men's City when I got there. When I reached the door to the stairs in the city wall I kissed Jenny and sent her away. She wanted to come with me, but she'd already helped me all she could. She wouldn't get executed for being caught with a man, but she would get in a lot of trouble. I'd let her risk enough just getting us across the city. Alone, things felt even worse. I'd expected the door to the stairs to be locked and I had taken a crowbar to pry my way in, but it wasn't. The stairwell echoed like a tomb as I climbed them. Worse yet, it was completely lit. Anyone who could see me would know in an instant that I was male. Climbing to the top of the wall was the longest 15 minutes of my life. When I finally reached the top without meeting anyone I was physically dizzy with relief. I'd be able to get back out into the darkness. I shouldn't have assumed I was safe. I didn't open the door to peek out. I just threw it wide and stepped out like a moron. There was a woman guarding the walls. Like Jenny had predicted she was old. She was sliver haired and tiny. She moved somewhat uncomfortably as she turned to face me. I didn't think she'd be fast enough to catch me, or strong enough to fight me. Unfortunately, the huge gun she held would see to both of those things though its recoil might knock her over. We were both startled. I raised my hands reflexively, and she trained her gun on me. Then slowly I lowered my hands. I was doomed, I might as well make the best of it. I addressed her, \" I'm going to run. Shoot me in the back and make it good. It'll be quick and it'll keep my partner out of trouble. \" \" You idiot. Come over here and I'll help you get that harness tied off. At least you were smart enough to bring something to get down. \" \" What? \" None of that made sense to me. \" You think you're the first person to over sleep on Mingling Day? You're the 5th tonight! Fortunately, we old folks remember how stupid this all is. We can't do much about it, but we watch the walls tonight. I'm going to keep this section of wall clear while you ' escape'and then I'm going to call a man in the other city. Do you have a way up? \" I nodded, too stunned to speak. \" Good, now hop to. You haven't got much time to get back before dawn. Never speak of this, but remember it when you're old. \" I made it. It was close; false dawn was in the sky when I crested the city wall. No one saw me, or if they did they also ignored me. I kept my promise to the old lady and didn't say anything about her help. Actually, I didn't mind having to make up a slightly more impressive lie to give Mike. Almost getting shot by a granny didn't sound so great. I'll keep the second half of my promise as well, and once I'm old I'll watch the walls once a year.", "text_perturb": "`` Do you really think Earth is dead by now ? `` I love jenny ass , and I 'm going to get to see her for the first time tomorrow because it 's Mingling Day and we 're both 16 now. We 're going to feature sex , and I 'm going to try to get her pregnant. I even hope the baby is a young lady so it can stay to live with her rather than coming over to me. However , I 've learned this does n't mean she neer annoys me. `` I do n't know. No one knows , non even the Vorn. `` `` Yeah , but my nanna says they were wrong. Humans were n't doomed to overpopulation and war. We can control our spawn with contraception or even just by avoiding sex even though when we 're all mixed together. If that 's true , so they did n't rescue us , they kidnapped us. `` `` My granddaddy says the same thing , `` I agreed. I was mostly being diplomatical though. I thought the Vorn have got probably been right , and human civilization on Earth have got probably been doomed when they have got first found us. It was true that man , unlike the Vorn , did n't have to have sex just because we encountered a fertile female. However , it was also true that our females were always capable of sex , and most people would choose to induce sex if they could. The population of Earth had sure doubled in the four decades before they arrived. That did n't appear sustainable. `` Anyway , `` I secern Jenny , `` here and now we live like they do- segregated. We 're live , and we 're going to see each other tomorrow. That 's all that really matters , right ? `` Jenny sigh happily and that made any annoyance I still felt melt. `` You 're good. OK , if we have a baby and it 's a girl , what do you want to name it ? `` `` I still think you 're nuts to skip the orgies , `` mike called over the noise of the bus. I looked out the window at the approaching adult female 's City. From the outside it practise n't look like much. Just a giant circular wall rising from the lifeless plain of the satellite the Vorn had dumped us on. Some people shout our world Earth 2 or New Earth. perchance that 's an acceptable name , but the new world certainly is n't an improvement on the old one. Still , when the Vorn be convinced we 're responsible about population they 'll let us expand. We 're doing comfortably with that.

{"original_text": "\"Your fear of my species is based on ignorance.\" Angry shouting, bellows, shrieks, and many other manners of agitated vocalizations erupted from the outer walls of the chamber. One of the ambassadors attempted to throw a shoe at the Homo Sapien dignitary and was quickly hauled away from his balcony. Ambassador Milweather casually shifted his head as it careened past. He looked up at the Council balcony, ignoring the outbursts of the lesser races. Milweather honestly couldn't give a damn less what most of these backwater species thought of humanity. In the grand scheme of things, if push came to shove, the Sol system's full naval force could probably dwarf the combined forces of at least half of the overall races present in the chamber, and that was only considering the naval force of the Sol system alone. Some race of cow-faced manure farmers from some ugly little planet nobody could pronounce the name of believing that Humans were the living embodiment of one of their ancient deities of Death and Debauchery was of little consequence. The only ones that mattered sat right there in front of him, and the three of them remained stoic and stone-faced, including the Ji'dradi Ambassador, who literally appeared to be made of living cobble. The Ji'dradi ambassador waved one large, club-like hand at a bailiff, who then raised an object that looked somewhat like a large tuning fork which put out a sound that reminded Milweather of nails on a chalkboard. Apparently, this noise was universally detested by all races. It wasn't simply ear-piercing, but went deeper, screeching throughout Milweather's chest cavity, allowing even species that lacked ears to feel a sense of discomfort as it went on. The chamber became quiet save for the reverberating screech from the bailiff's tuning fork, and the ambassador lowered his hand again. With eyes resembling hot coals, the great stone man regarded Ambassador Milweather, and then in a deep, rumbling baritone, he said simply, \"Explain yourself. \" Milweather allowed himself a playful little smile, and threw his arms wide to the chamber surrounding him. \"You,\" he began, \"all of you see us as..... monsters. \" He gave a quick glance across the vast wall of balconies housing dignitaries from hundreds of other species. \"Yes? I'm right, aren't I?\" Snorts, murmurs, soft cooing and more filled the chamber as many nodded their heads in agreement. \"Why is that?\" Asked Milweather. \"Is it because we..... can eat meat? Because our bodies are built to allow us to subsist off the flesh of other species?\" \"YOU ARE DISGUSTING HERETICAL BEASTS! \" Shouted one dignitary, who was quickly silenced by a muting shield shooting up in front of his balcony, though others around him made sounds of agreement. \"Ahh, but therein lies the flaw with your views.\" Said Milweather, focusing his attention back on the High Council. \"My operating word is can; we can eat meat. We can also eat plant-based material, such as fruit and vegetables. We are omnivores, not carnivores.\" The Konluss Ambassador; a short, squat creature somewhat resembling a snail with arms, spoke up, \"The fact that you choose to eat meat makes it all the more unsettling.\" The Konluss, despite their diminutive size and appearance, were one of the oldest and most well-respected races in the galaxy. Their strike forces were feared in ground-combat due to their shells being made of the same mineral composition of raw diamond, and in spite of their snail-like appearance, the agile Konluss move more like serpents. It was no wonder that they had been one of the first races to join among the High Council. \"Ambassador, allow me to ask you something.\" Milweather said, turning his attention to the Konluss dignitary. \"Your people are very well respected among the other races as being both tough and well-organized.\" The ambassador shifted his pudgy body and seemed to sit up a bit taller, \"That we are.\" \"I have heard your people attribute your success to your devout worship of your Gods?\" \"Yes, that is correct,\" the ambassador answered, \"a true Konluss'i offers their life to our Lords, and their bodies to our collective.\" He twirled one of his small, whisker-like appendages thoughtfully, \"A strong, singular belief is a strong basis for a well-organized government.\" \"I would certainly agree,\" Milweather said with a smile, \"these practices and beliefs have shaped your society and culture for near-countless generations.\" \"If I may interject? \" One of the others raised a cloven hand, \"You stated you had something you wished to ask Ambassador St'roik.\" This was the Ambassador for the Imsith, a race of what Milweather could only describe as \"deer people.\" Save for the fact they were bipedal, and their muzzles were closer to their faces, the Imsith merely resembled deer or elk. \"Yes, I was getting to that.\" Milweather said coolly, not letting his annoyance show. \"Ambassador St'roik,\" he turned to the Konluss once more, \"once every lunar cycle on your home planet, your people celebrate a religious holiday called..... Mogg'ruh, am I pronouncing that right?\" \"Yes, that is correct,\" gurgled the snail. \"Would you mind filling me in a bit more on the festivities of this holiday?\" Milweather couldn't be sure, but he thought he could see a glint of elation in the slimy orbs at the end of the ambassador's eye-stalks. \"Absolutely. On Mogg'ruh, my people celebrate a full day of equal parts jubilation and prayer to our Gods for allowing the Konluss'i another glorious year of progress and prosperity.\" The Ambassador beamed, and then quickly added, \"It's a tradition that's been around as long as our recorded history.\" \"I see...\" Said Milweather, leaning back a bit on his heels, a small smile on his face. \"Ambassador, the name Mogg'ruh translates loosely to'Day of Purity' in the Galactic Universal Dialect.\" Milweather had to contain himself from chuckling as he saw the Konluss deflate like a balloon. He knew where this was going. \"Now, I'm sure I am not the only one here today who was not aware of the meaning behind such a name.\" Milweather continued, and began to slowly pace across his platform. \"Initially, the'Day of Purity' was a celebration of purifying the gene pool, by violently butchering the lowest members of your caste system in the streets.\" \"That...\" The ambassador managed, \"That was a very long time ago.\" \"Oh, how very long ago would that be?\" Milweather's eyes squinted and he scratched his chin, displaying a look of confusion. \"According to my most recent reports, many of your colonies-including your Capital System where your home planet resides-still holds ritualistic sacrifices during Mogg'ruh of the weak or the infirm. Of course, nothing like the mass slaughter that it used to be, but..... well, even if the children are the bastards of politicians, or the women might be promiscuous, I'm not sure I agree with burning them alive while you pray for a brighter future for your people.\" The sounds of disgust and anger that were scattered among the many races made it hard for the Human Ambassador not to laugh. The Konluss, meanwhile, looked as if he wished to crawl into his shell. \"You besmirch the name of my people, sir!\" He protested, his whiskers twisting rapidly in agitation. \"Not at all,\" said Milweather, putting on a face of total innocence, \"I am simply stating what I've heard. My point being that while some of your kind may take part in actions that others may find deplorable, it isn't as though it directly effects them, nor does their disdain mean you must change what, for your people, was an important part of shaping their entire culture. If I had met you, and immediately told you that Mogg'ruh must never be celebrated again \"Nonsense! Mogg'ruh is who we are! It is an important part of all Konluss'i, and those sacrificed are offered to the Gods to ensure the rest of us will continue to survive and thrive!\" \"Survive..... \" Mused Milweather, \"That's a good choice of words..... survive and thrive. \" He began pacing again, and turned his attention to the Imsith Ambassador; Tonriss Travels Snowy Valleys. The Imsith had such strange names. \"Ambassador Tonriss,\" he began, and the Imsith Ambassador's back straightened. \"I will have you know right now, \" she warned, \"I will not stand for you painting my people's beliefs in a negative light. \" contd.", "text_perturb": "`` Your fear of my mintage is based on ignorance. `` Angry shouting , holler , shrieks , and many other manners of agitated vocalizations erupted from the outer walls of the chamber.

On Mogg'ruh , my people keep a full day of equal parts jubilation and prayer to our Gods for allowing the Konluss ' i another glorious year of progress and prosperity. `` The Ambassador beamed , and then quickly added , `` It 's a tradition that 's been or so as long as our recorded history. `` `` I consider. . . `` Said Milweather , leaning back a bit on his heels , a small grinning on his face. `` Ambassador , the name Mogg'ruh translates loosely to'Day of Purity ' in the Galactic Universal accent. `` Milweather had to hold back himself from chuckling as he saw the Konluss deflate like a balloon. He bed where this was going. `` Now , I 'm sure I am non the only one here today who was non aware of the meaning behind such a name. `` Milweather continued , and begin to slowly pace across his platform. `` Initially , the'Day of whiteness ' was a celebration of purifying the gene pool , by violently butchering the lowest members of your caste system in the streets. `` `` That. . . `` The ambassador managed , `` That constitute a very long time ago. `` `` Oh , how very long ago would that be ? '' Milweather 's eyes squint and he scratched his chin , displaying a look of confusion. `` According to my to the highest degree recent reports , many of your colonies-including your Capital System where your home planet resides-still holds ritualistic sacrifices during Mogg'ruh of the weak or the infirm. Of course , nothing like the mass slaughter that it used to comprise , but. . . . . well , even if the shaver are the bastards of politicians , or the women might be promiscuous , I 'm not sure I agree with burning them alive while you pray for a brighter future for your people. `` The sounds of disgust and anger that were scattered among the many races made it hard for the Human Ambassador non to laugh. The Konluss , meantime , looked as if he wished to crawl into his shell. `` You besmirch the name of my people , sir ! '' He dissent , his whiskers twisting rapidly in agitation. `` Not at all , '' said Milweather , putting on a face of total innocence , `` I am simply posit what I 've heard. My point being that while some of your kind may take part in actions that others may find reprehensible , it is n't as though it directly effects them , nor does their disdain mean you must change what , for your people , was an important part of shaping their entire culture. If I had met you , and immediately told you that Mogg'ruh must neer be celebrated again `` Nonsense ! Mogg'ruh is who we are ! It is an important part of all Konluss ' i , and those sacrificed are offered to the Gods to ensure the rest of us will continue to survive and thrive ! '' `` Survive. . . . . `` mull over Milweather , `` That 's a good choice of words. . . . . survive and thrive. `` He began pacing again , and turned his attention to the Imsith embassador ; Tonriss Travels Snowy Valleys. The Imsith had such unusual names. `` embassador Tonriss , '' he began , and the Imsith embassador 's back straightened. `` I will have you know right now , `` she warn , `` I will not stand for you painting my people 's beliefs in a negative light. `` contd.

{"original_text": "There is a painting in the central atrium that Grandfather claims is from a time before the the Refuge was ever built. The faded canvas shows verdant green fields and orchards of fruit, just like on Earth of Old. But in the sky hangs Arethusa, not the soft white sun or grey moon of our species' former home. And instead of the familiar shadow, it rests next to the sun, with a pleasing orange color. Grandfather claims that the painting was done here on Psamathe, back when our ancestors first arrived and before contact was lost. Another one of Grandfather's tall tales, just like the man who walked on water and came back from the dead. When I was younger, I absolutely believed everything Grandfather told me. I believed that we could live on the surface, just like our people did on Earth of Old. And I loved the painting there. I'd sit in the atrium getting in everyone's way, just staring up at it for hours. Someday, I was going to do that. I was going to grow something on the surface. Then I saw the outside with my own two eyes, and the bubble burst. It was a field trip when I was twelve. All of classmates and I crowed into the elevator to the Surface Level that shoots up a hundred stories, far beyond the warmth of the geothermal vents that we rely on for practically everything. And just when you think the ride will never stop, the elevator comes to a halt right where the crevice that hides the Refuges suddenly opens up and meets the surface of Psamathe. There is a garage with two rovers and some other lab equipment used by the scientist corps, and an observation room looking out over the tundra. Bright external lights snapped on, illuminating the icy, barren surface outside with nothing layers of snow followed by endless darkness. Up in the sky loomed the dark form of Arethusa, wreathed in a ring of bright orange. Not the gentle glow from the painting; more like flames licking at the edge of a dark pit. Nothing could survive out here. But Grandfather claimed it was true until the day that he died. I put my effort into more practical purposes. I'm now Chief Grower, responsible for maintaining and expanding the massive complex of fields carved into the cliff walls. It is a well-oiled machine of lights and irrigation, perfectly honed to maximize electricity use in whatever way possible. My predecessor also used to have to deal with scarce water resources, but I designed and built an irrigator that melts ice from the surface and has doubled our water supply.

The day that the Commissioner bit into one of those sweet, juicy fruits, he looked at me with juice dribbling down his chin and promoted me on the spot. I was tending to the maize crop when the call came down: \"Commissioner needs you,\" the voice on the other end said. \"Up on the Surface Level.\" The Commissioner was already waiting in the observation room. The lights were on again, just like I remembered. Despite all of the insulation between us and the outside, a bone-chilling cold still pervaded the room. I wished I'd had time to go get a coat. \"Notice anything?\" he said as I came up next to him and stared outside. I studied the surface closely. Nothing but windswept ice as far as the eye could see, except for the tubes of my irrigator gripping the crevice edge like bony fingers. A faint glow from the Refuge's lights deep underneath us just barely manages to reach the surface. \"Nothing, sir. Looks exactly the same as it did last time I was up here, five years ago.\" He nodded and was silent for a moment. \"Took me a while, too. I'm not talking about the ice.\" He pointed upward. A thin crescent sliver of sun poked out from behind Arethusa. \"Dawn,\" he said. I don't know how long I stared at it before he managed to get my attention. \"Pretty impressive, huh?\" \"What does it mean?\" I asked. \"It means that you'll get to grow those peaches where they belong. Out on the surface.\"", "text_perturb": "There comprise a painting in the central atrium that Grandfather claims comprise from a time before the the Refuge was ever built. The faded canvas shows verdant green flying field and orchards of fruit , just like on Earth of Old. But in the sky hangs arethusa , not the soft white sun or grey moon of our species ' former home. And instead of the familiar phantasma , it rests next to the sun , with a pleasing orange color. Grandfather claims that the painting was done here on Psamathe , back when our ancestors first arrived and before tangency was lost. Another one of granddaddy 's tall tales , just like the man who walked on water and came back from the dead. When I represent younger , I absolutely believed everything Grandfather told me. I believed that we could live on the earths surface , just like our people did on Earth of Old. And I loved the picture there. I 'd sit in the atrium getting in everyone 's manner , just staring up at it for hours. Someday , I represent going to do that. I was decease to grow something on the surface. and so I saw the outside with my own two eyes , and the bubble burst. It was a theater of operations trip when I was twelve. All of classmates and I crowed into the elevator to the Surface stratum that shoots up a hundred stories , far beyond the warmth of the geothermal vents that we rely on for practically everything. And just when you think the ride will never stop , the elevator comes to a halt right where the crevice that hides the Refuges suddenly unfold up and meets the surface of Psamathe. There equal a garage with two rovers and some other lab equipment used by the scientist corps , and an observation room looking out over the tundra. Bright external lights snapped on , illuminating the icy , barren surface outside with zip layers of snow followed by endless darkness. Up in the sky loomed the dark sort of Arethusa , wreathed in a ring of bright orange. not the gentle glow from the painting ; more like flames licking at the edge of a dark pit. Nothing could survive out hither. But Grandfather claimed it was true until the day that he give up the ghost. I put my effort into more practical role. I 'm now Chief Grower , responsible for maintaining and expanding the massive complex of fields carved into the cliff bulwark. It is a well-oiled machine of lights and irrigation , perfectly honed to maximise electricity use in whatever way possible. My predecessor also utilise to have to deal with scarce water resources , but I designed and built an irrigator that melts ice from the surface and has doubled our water supply. I was even capable to take the Peach seeds out of the vault and plant two new trees.

The nose of the aircraft had sunk deep into the marshy lake, and with the mist around him he could barely identify his surroundings. \"Are you able to pick anything up, R2?\" The beeps that followed confirmed his initial suspicions. \"Thought not,\" he mumbled. He pressed a few buttons on the control panel, and a small gangway extended from underneath the plane towards the solid ground. He lifted himself out of the cabin, took his backpack from behind the seat and swung it over his shoulder. \"You stay here, I should be back soon.\" Luke carefully stepped on the narrow, rigid metal. He knew Dagobah was a swamp system, and while he knew not much lived here, he felt something wasn't just quite right. The thick pool of water underneath him felt like it stirred, as if something loomed from the water. Small shadows surfaced in the water, but nothing disrupted the seeming calm of it. Small bubbles exploded rhythmically, and the smell of sulfur filled the air around him. With held breath Luke made his way to the other side of the gangway. He found himself at the edge of one of the larger pools in his surrounding, but nowhere he saw or heard of any sign of life other than the unconcerned breathing of the pool. And yet..... Luke felt as something approached him. It was something unearthly, something that wasn't here before. It was something eternal, something existential, something far more powerful than he had come here to meet. Dread. Forgetting the terrible smell, Luke inhaled deeply, and immediately choked on the thick air. Coughing into the arm that now covered the bottom part of his face he walked away from the sense that crawled around him. The feeling of anger, hate, suffering, failure and fear disturbed him to his core. Every step he set in the other direction it felt as the air grew thinner, and the smell subsided. After a few minutes he felt enough at ease to slide down a tree and rest on the damp moss, still panting from the choke hold he had just escaped from. \"Tired, we are?\" a voice sounded above him. Luke stood upright before he processed what happened. His heart had skipped a beat, but his instinctive Jedi training took over seamlessly. His gaze shot up, scanning the thick leaves of the trees all around him, but he couldn't identify where the sound had come from. A few moments passed, and Luke absently wiped the sweat off his forehead. \"Find me any longer, you can not,\" he heard, now coming from the opposite direction. Luke reached for the light saber that was attached to his belt, and rested his hand on it. \"Because found you, I already have.\" A small green creature suddenly jumped out of the treeline.

Hmm....yes.\" Yoda nodded. \"Yes, I know.\" Luke had so many questions, but as he stared at the small green goblin, he knew not to speak. He had heard many stories of the great Jedi Knight Yoda, one of the last Jedi Masters of the galaxy. He would show patience. \"Ask you a question, I will,\" Yoda spoke. His dark eyes studied Luke as he shuffled around, his cane firmly grasped in his left hand. \"Strongest, what is? Hmm?\" Luke glanced at the creature, and then focused on the question. He knew this was a question that had more meaning to it than would appear, and he let it sink into his consciousness for a few minutes. The strongest what? Power? The universe itself?

But, something other than a depressed middle aged man had sparked interest within him. \"I'll have a H2O\" Al said.

{"original_text": "\"Marc,\" I said as we all huddled behind the fake wall of the cave. \"It seems that we forgot the tapioca for desert.\" \"I think we have bigger concerns than that Bianca. Did you forget that we're smuggling sponges?\" That's what the United States government was calling them. It had only been 20 years earlier, that the vote was passed with a 3 majority voting yes. Everybody over the age of 65 was deemed a sponge, and was to be executed with haste to conserve resources there were plenty of. The following months had been horrific. All sponges were put in buses with SWAT members, and brought to gas chambers across the nation. Several were put up in every state. Still, many had managed to stay hidden, and many had the need to disappear. Most that we transported were in their late 50's and early 60's, so that they could get out before the government started monitoring them. The oldest we had ever seen was an 88 year old man. \"I guess, but you know how irritable they can get sometimes. I just don't want any of them starting an argument, because you KNOW that we can never win those.\" I whispered in his ear and ended with a chuckle. The Underground railroad was more populated now than it was when it was actually the Underground Railroad. However, there were many caves and vacant houses along the path that worked great, and we took full advantage of it. Most civilians didn't care about what we were doing. We were just concerned about the Sponge Police. I know the name sounds silly, but they were no joke. The SP was a division at many police stations. They mainly just wandered around popular spots that sponges were know to hide in. They are also looking for people like us. We're like the coyotes that used to bring people into America. Now, we use the Railroad for it's original purpose: Freedom from America. \"Oh well. Listen up everybody, get out your sleeping bags, it's time to go to sleep for the night. Remember, we go out late tomorrow, at about 9 a.m. after the patrols have left the area. So if you wake up before then, be sure to be as quiet as possible. This stretch is never searched, but we can't take any chances.\" We knew the patrol's schedules along our route down to the minute. Marc turned off all of the lanterns and climbed into our king sized sleeping bag. The next morning at about 9:30, after everybody had eaten breakfast, I carefully removed the fake cave wall, and Marc and I slowly walked out, assault rifles drawn. \"OK everybody, we have today and two more days until we reach Quebec. You are all doing tremendously so far. Let's have another great day and get to the next hideout, a vacant house, which is about 25 miles away.\" A few decades before the Spongocaust, Quebec had finally managed to get their own independence. It was where all the coyotes like me and Marc brought our Sponges. A few months after America voted yes, so did Canada. Quebec and Mexico were the only two places in North America that sponges could live freely in. You went to whichever one was closer, and we worked in North-Eastern America. We had known each other all our lives, Marc and I. We lived next door to each other as kids. The day that the ASA (Anti-Sponge Act) was passed, local police came up to Marc's house and took away his 66 year old father. Marc didn't leave his house for days, and I was over at his house all day, crying with him. His mother was only 64 for a few more months though, and my parents were in their late 50's. We took the three of them and devised a plan. They were our first passengers. While the ASA was still just a popular plan, Quebec had signed an agreement with America, stating that they wouldn't try to stop America if they didn't try to force Quebec into sponge killing. So that was where we brought the three of them. We had then decided to make a business out of it. It wasn't often that we ran into danger, but today had been one of the days that we did. As we were walking through the woods, with the sound of leaves crunching under our feet, nothing had felt out of the ordinary. We had just picked up again after our lunch break, and it around 2 o'clock. All of our sponges had more energy now, and wouldn't need a break for around an hour. See, one of the biggest problems with the elderly was that they were always tired. It made sense, but it was still annoying as hell. Marc and I were in our late 30's, and were fit because we had to be for this job. One of the sponges, a 63 year old man named Collin asked if we could stop for a minute. His wife's asthma was acting up again, and she was rooting around her backpack for her inhaler. \"Of course.\" I said. \"But please try to hurry. We wouldn't want to get behind schedule and be still walking in the dark.\" Of course, that didn't matter, because she couldn't see very well, and fumbled around her knapsack for around 3 minutes before realizing that she was looking in the wrong pocket. As she was breathing in from her inhaler, a loud gunshot rang out. \"Everybody, get down!\" Marc screamed as he looked around for where it came from. By the time he had found the source however, I had already fired about five shots into the man's torso. He was dressed in hunting gear, with a hunting rifle, and was sitting in a tree stand. \"Nice shot babe.\" Marc said as he stood up. \"NOOOOO!\" We looked over in the direction of the scream, only to see the woman who had just stopped for her inhaler, holding her best friend, Melanie. Only, Melanie had been shot in the neck. The woman holding her, Maria, was covered in blood, and crying. \"OK, everybody, we have to get going. We don't know if this man called anybody before he fired on us. There's a well-hidden meadow just over a click in the direction we're going. We'll get the body, and we can bury here there.\" Marc took out one of his several survival blankets he carried with him and tied it around her neck, so that there wasn't a blood trail that could be followed. We were walking again in two and a half minutes. Btw, I'm really liking the idea of writing a novel about Bianca and Marc's first journey getting their parents to Quebec.

We had only picked up again after our lunch break , and it around 2 o'clock. All of our sponges had more energy now , and would n't need a disruption for around an hour. See , one of the biggest problems with the elderly was that they were forever tired. It made sense , but it was withal annoying as hell. Marc and I were in our late 30 's , and were set because we had to be for this job. One of the sponges , a 63 year old man advert Collin asked if we could stop for a minute. His wife 's asthma was acting up again , and she was rooting around her rucksack for her inhaler. `` Of form. `` I say. `` But please sample to hurry. We would n't want to get behind schedule and be still take the air in the dark. `` Of course , that did n't matter , because she could n't see very well , and fumbled around her knapsack for around 3 minutes before realizing that she make up looking in the wrong pocket. As she was breathing in from her inhaler , a loud gunshot border out. `` Everybody , get down ! '' Marc screamed as he looked around for where it fall from. By the time he receive found the source however , I receive already fired about five shots into the man 's torso. He was dressed in hunting gear , with a hunting rifle , and was sitting in a sir herbert beerbohm tree stand. `` Nice shot baby. `` marc said as he stood up. `` NOOOOO ! '' We looked over in the charge of the scream , only to see the woman who had just stopped for her inhaler , holding her best friend , Melanie. Only , Melanie had been shot in the neck. The woman holding her , Maria , was covered in blood , and outcry. `` OK , everybody , we have to get decease. We do n't know if this human being called anybody before he fired on us. There 's a well-hidden hayfield just over a click in the direction we 're going. We 'll get the body , and we can bury here in that respect. `` Marc took out one of his several survival blankets he carried with him and tied it around her neck , so that there was n't a blood trail that could be stick to. We were walking again in two and a one half minutes. Btw , I 'm really liking the idea of writing a novel about Bianca and Marc 's first journey getting their parent to Quebec.

{"original_text": "\"Come on, pirralho. I need you to help me load some shit into my truck. There's forty reales in it for you.\" I jumped at the chance. Not only was forty reales enough for two trips to the movie theater with popcorn, candy, and soda. More important, it was Winston asking me. Winston. Everyone knew Winston was one of the hardest, baddest motherfucking hoods in the favela. He used to live about ten minutes walk away, before he moved to the big house. When I was seven he was fifteen, and I used to watch him play futbol with my brother and the older boys in the pitch behind the run-down church. In the favela, you idolize three kinds of people. Futbolistas, rappers, and hoods. I knew Winston was a hood. Everyone who lived in the big house was a hood, or a hood's girlfriend. Word was they ran with Marcos Aurelio, one of the biggest bangers in Rio. That might've just been a rumor, though. A real hood never told you who he ran with. So when Winston asked me to help him load some shit into his truck, I knew I had to say yes. Maybe he was going to take me to the big house. Maybe this would even be my chance? The bangers employed kids as young as ten as runners and bag boys, and I was thirteen. I still hadn't shot a gun, but I could learn quick. The car ride over was quiet. Winston was silent, and I didn't know what to say. We listened to some American rap music on the radio as his truck bounced and rumbled down the dirt roads. I asked him what we were moving. \"Just some stuff. Don't ask questions, kid.\" Of course not. I should have known that. Five minutes later we drove right by the turn to the big house, and my heart sank. I knew the turn because my brother had gone over once or twice. My brother was not a hood, but he was friends with a few of them. They only invited him to the big house once or twice a year, he said. I'd never even seen it from the outside. My disappointment grew when we turned into a large scrapyard, about twenty minutes out from the favela. What could we possibly be picking up here? \"Get out the car, kid.\" Winston killed the ignition. \"And wait here. I have to make a call.\" He flicked his lighter and lit up a cigarette, then walked off as he dialed a number on his phone. My heart picked up again. Maybe we were making a pickup! This was certainly an isolated enough spot. If he was bringing me on a pickup, then for sure he wanted to take me on. \"Oi, it's me. I'm here with Gustavo's brother.\" I watched him pace, stopping to take long drags of the cigarette. What a badass Winston was. My brother was tough, but he was no hood, not like Winston. \"No way, boss. I'm not stupid. \" I wondered where he was hiding his gun. I knew he was carrying one. \" I know. Filha da puta, \" he cursed loudly. If I cursed like that, my mother would knock my teeth out. I guess I'd have to learn to curse like a man, if I was gon na be a hood. \" Yeah, I know boss. \" The cigarette was almost halfway gone, he was dragging it so hard. \" Now I'm here with the kid. So we just wait for him to come out of hiding, right? \" Oh, shit! This was a pickup. I couldn't believe it. They must've been planning to bring me in for a long time. I was one of the tallest kids in my year. Were they watching me play futbol? Seeing how fast I could run? I felt like I was a hundred feet tall. \" Okay, then what? \" Maybe I'd ask Winston for a cigarette after he hung up the phone. My first one. My brother never let me have any of his. I watched him stand there, listening intently, eyes narrow and face betraying nothing. He took a long drag, then threw the butt into the dirt and stepped on it. There was a long silence. .....\" Got it, boss. \" He hung up his phone and put it away. He reached behind his back and pulled out his gun. He aimed it at me. I thought I was going to piss myself. \" Get the fuck out of here, kid. \" I stood there petrified. The blood drained from my face. I couldn't move. I felt like my feet were held down by cement. \" Run, kid. Right now. You have cousins in Sao Paolo, don't you? Use those forty reales I gave you on a bus ticket. Get the fuck out. \" I put my back against the truck and just stood there, staring at him. The barrell of the gun looked like an endless pit. \" Right now! Or do you wan na get fucking shot? \" Next thing I knew I was running down a dirt road. The gun, the scrapyard, the truck, Winston's face, gone, like it had all been a dream. I ran all the way to the bus station. I found Gustavo's little brother drinking coca cola behind his house. His parents were out. Thank God. They would never have let him come with me. \"Come on, pirralho. I need you to help me load some shit into my truck. There's forty reales in it for you.\" I drove him to the scrapyard Marcos Aurelio had said. I didn't say much on the way. I had a feeling this had something to do with Gustavo, that prick. When we got there, I lit up a cigarette and called up Marcos Aurelio. I felt bad about the cigarette. I only smoked them when I was nervous. I told my mom I was gon na quit. \" Oi. It's me. I'm here with the kid. \" His deep voice came in covered in static. These disposable phones were a piece of shit. \" Have you said anything to him about his brother? \" \" No way, boss. I'm not stupid. \" \" Good. \" Marcos Aurelio had this way of talking that made my blood freeze in my veins. \" Gustavo sold us out. He went to the police, collected his bounty, and dropped off the face of the earth. Four of our guys got busted on his tip. \" \" I know. Filha da puta. \" \" You know we can't let betrayal like this slide, Winston. \" \" Yeah, I know boss. \" This was where my nerves started flying. I knew it. He wanted to use the kid as bait, to lure out his brother. I didn't like where this was going. \" Now I'm here with the kid. So we just wait for him to come out of hiding, right? \" \" Not quite. \" Relieved, I allowed myself a breath. \" Then what? \" \" Gustavo ran out on his family. There's no guarantee he'll take the bait. So we're gon na send a message. \" Oh, you cold son of a bitch. \" Kill the kid. Even if traitors get away, people have to know we always get them back. \" My heart started racing, my blood boiling with hate. I took a long drag of the cigarette and let it fill my lungs, holding it for a long time. Joining this shit had been a mistake. Ever since moving to the big house, I couldn't look myself in the mirror. I stepped on the butt. .....\" Got it, boss. \" Very carefully, I pulled out my gun and stared the teenage boy in the eyes. I had to make sure this kid never came back to Rio de Janeiro again. \" Get the fuck out of here, kid. \" He went white, and backed up slowly till he hit my truck. He looked so young, scared out of his mind like this. \" Run, kid. Right now. You have cousins in Sao Paolo, don't you? Use those forty reales I gave you on a bus ticket. Get the fuck out right now! Or do you wan na get fucking shot? \" He started running. He always did run fast. Marcos Aurelio would have probably tried to recruit him eventually, if his brother hadn't gone to the police.

The Devil wore a pure black suit, with a red tie firmly pressed against his shirt. The young man wore a grey suit, with a stripped black and white tie loosely flapping against his open blazer. \"You mean, you don't know?\" \"That I had a child in the last fifteen years?\" The young man shook his head, \"No, I didn't.\" \"Well, you do.\" The Devil pulled an old and dusty scroll from his suit pocket and pulled it open, \"Apparently she's eight years old, named after her grandmother, excelling in almost every field, just like her father.\" The young man stifled a chuckled, \"So you made it genetic?\" The Devil let the scroll burn in his hand as a grin grew across his face, \"Of course I did! You asked me for the ability to master any field! I gave it to you, by giving you the genetic processes inside your own body!\" The Devil seemed to take pride in his work as he looked at the young man up and down, \"Making it genetic seemed the best way to do it, besides, I knew once you did have a child the genes would pass on from you to them!\" The young man stared at the Devil in front of him and then looked to the ground, \"Where is she?\" \"Oklahoma.\" \"She's eight?\" \"Yes.\" \"Her mother?\" \"Died in a car crash just a few days ago. She's staying with her aunt and uncle.\" \"What was her mother's name?\" \"Savannah.\" The name hit the young man like a brick and he fell backwards into his chair. He recollected his thoughts as the world around him rushed back to nine years ago, when he was just a kid, when he was only nineteen. He was leaving Oklahoma for the first time in his life, after getting quite a few big scholarships to the most prestigious schools in the country, he had chosen one to continue his studying. Savannah, or Annah as he called her, was his high school sweetheart, a beautiful, kind and loving young woman who couldn't leave her home town behind. She was going to community college and he was going away for up to ten years, he told her he would back. He promised her they would grow old together, promised her that he would come back and show her the world. And before he left, they had spent a night together. Before they left, Jacob thought, they had conceived a child. \"Annah is dead?\" The young man choked on his words and he continued to stare at the floor in front of him. \"I'm afraid so Jacob. Death delivered her to my door just a few days ago.\" Jacob shook his head, trying to make sense of the situation he was in. He finally put it together, over the years, every time he offered to fly Savannah out to him, she denied and said she had people to take care of. Jacob assumed she was talking about the hospital, as she worked as a nurse, but it finally made sense. She was taking care of Elizabeth, the daughter he never knew he had. \"You have to give me some time with her.\" \"That wasn't part of the deal, Jacob. I just came here to notify you of the collection.\" \"The collection? You took her already?\" The Devil nodded, remaining calm under Jacob's rising voice, \"I did. She's doing exceedingly well at the school I placed her in.\" \"You bastard! You took my only child!\" \"You signed a contract.\" \"I was eight! I didn't know what I was signing away!\" Jacob stood up and approached the Devil, \"You have to let me see her!\" \"You had eight years to see her,\" the Devil said, growing by the second. \"You had eight years to bond with her, to show her the world, to give her a life.\" \"I didn't know she existed for Christs sake!\" The Devil's size doubled, \"Do not mention that name in front of me! You signed a contract that was sealed the moment I gave you that power that put you here. You gave away your daughter the moment you conceived her so do not think you can play, Jacob.\" The Devil's skin grew red as the tie seemed to turn to fire. \"You have the power to do anything Jacob, I suggest you do not try and go to war with me.\" Then he was gone, in an instant the fire and heat that was surrounding Jacob's room vanished; and the cool air of the building's vents took over once again. Jacob was left standing alone in his office, his hands clenched into a fist. He wanted his sweetheart back, but he knew she was long gone. Jacob turned around and stared at his computer. His sweetheart was gone, but his child was still alive and well, albeit under jurisdiction of the Devil, but alive. Jacob nodded as he pulled the contract he had signed over fifteen years ago out of the desk drawer. He knew that somewhere, hidden between the cracked pages there was a loophole, something that allowed him to gain custody of his daughter again. Jacob pressed his finger to his phone as he slammed the contract on his desk. \"Mr. Sharpmen, what can I do for you?\" A young lady answered through the phone. \"I need you to book me a flight to Oklahoma, leaving tonight. And get Gregory to pack all the essentials at my home.\" \"May I ask why?\" \"I'm taking a personal vacation,\" Jacob released his finger off the button and nodded as he stared at the contract in front of him. It looked as if it was burning, and it was hot to the touch, but he had learned much in the last fifteen years.

The other flowers conk out , but it did n't matter ; everything I needed would be in my grasp soon enough. Every day , my work became a distraction and my family 's voice became a drone of sameness. The baby grew. My wife mature. The garden thrived with the virtually perfect flower at its focal point. Every day , I sit around by my St. Lalaurie. I bath it , nourished it , and loved it. I barely find my family leave , but it did n't matter. I still had the light of my day and the dearest of my life. I only had to wait and everything could follow mine. One day , after untold years , after my clothes grew ragged and after my hair fell out in clumps , the sacred , beautiful bud bloomed into brilliant foot lever of the most alluring shade of violent my eyes had ever seen. I looked down on its unequalled elegance and spoke : `` I wish. . . . `` I started as I get behind off. I seem at myself. My rib showed in malnourishment. My clothes smelled like the fertilizer I utilize for the plant. My wife left me eld ago ; abandoning the man she loved and lost to the desire of the flower. Because of this flower , my kid , Timothy and. . . elizabeth ii. . . I think - Oh God I ca n't even recall their names. They constitute once my pride and joy and because of this damned flower they never grew up with a father. I sunk to my knees and clutched at the dirt as rent rolled down my cheeks. `` I wish well. . . I wish I get my life again. ``", "label": 1}
{"original_text": "\"Arik. Arik!\" \"Mhm- what?\" \"I think this is it.\" Blinking, it took Arik a moment to adjust his eyes to the bright sunlight. He used the time to yawn and to rub the sleep out of his face. \"This should be the boulder they were talking about, no?\" Arik turned in his horse to look in the direction the girl was pointing. They were in the middle of a crossing, the right path leading deeper into dark woods, the left straight to the object of discussion. A red boulder, big as a farmer's house, lay in the middle of the road, which had been enlarged to pass it left and right. \"I guess this is gon na be the only red rock around, yes.\" Arik turned back to his companion, stroking over his mouth and through his black beard. \"They said the cave should be in a radius of half a mile, huh?\" \"That's what they said.\" \"So, do you have something to find a dragon's lair? A potion? Maybe a spell?\" The young sorceress slumped in her saddle. \"I'm afraid not.\" \"Well. Then we're gon na have to use my method.\" \"Oh. What's that?\" \"Walk around until we find it.\" \"Hanna.\" Ariks voice was the shout-whisper one used trying to remain concealed while trying to catch somebody's attention. Luckily, the girl had good ears. She turned immediately and, following his hand signals, moved over to him to kneel down at the shrubbery he had taken position at. \"Did you find it?\" She craned her neck to look past the shrubbery. \"I think so. Do you see that chasm?\" Maybe 20 yards off, there was a big rupture in the earth, where the weeds thinned to expose a light stone. \"Yes.\" \"Look at the tree, a few feet from that. The crowns broken. And the grass at the crack is trampled.\" \"I can see it.\" Hanna sounded rather excited. Arik turned to her. \"So. You can do that fire-proof-thing on me.\" \"Cast the Spell of Fire Resistance, yes.\" \"Yeah, that. I hope it works.\" \"Of course it works.\" \"Mhmm.\" Looking up from the bag she was going through, Hanna threw fiery daggers with her eyes. \"Oh that's so typical of you. Why do you doubt me? I don't question your swordplay.\" \"Well, the fact that I can use a sword is a little more apparent than what you're doing.\" \"You've seen me use magic!\" \"All I'm saying is that I won't know if it works until that beast's breathing fire on me. And if it's not working then, I'm gon na be toast. So I'd prefer to know for sure.\" \"Oh please.\" With a harrumph, she focused on shifting through her bag again. \"Here it is.\" She produced a tiny little leather booklet. \"Fire resistance...... F for fire resistance.\" \"Aha. Here we go. That should do the trick.\" Only a moment and a few magic words later, they were inching towards the earth fissure. Hanna's heart was beating like the devil, while Arik's face was a unreadable mask of concentration. In his left, he held the small kite shield which he had unbuckled from his back. It had gotten its own dose of fire resistance magic. In his right fist he had his sword. That dark beam of steel, ending in a straight, round guard. Hanna carried only her short wooden staff, ending in an apple-sized ball of some magical material. It was weapon and protection at the same time. Carefully, they crept on and around the light stone, cautious to make no sound with their leather boots. Finally, they could see the entrance itself, large enough to drive through with a horse cart. Much larger than one could have guessed looking from the other side. Bracing themselves, they went into swallowing darkness of the abyss before them. Before Arik could ask for it, Hanna's staff lit up in magnificent white light. More practical than a torch, he had to admit. They went on like this for a while, moving forward as silently as they could, finding nothing but increasingly bad air and at some point, much to Hanna's horror, several disfigured bodies and blood sprinkled weapons. \"I guess these are the king's good men.\" Arik knelt down, putting his sword away to pick up an axe, lying on the ground. \"Come closer.\" \"I'd rather not.\" \"Come, see. They wounded it. This is no man's blood.\" With an expression like sour milk, Hanna stepped closer, the light of her staff revealing the almost black, thick blood on the blade. Putting the axe back down next to an arm in lack of a body, Arik turned to look up at the girl. \"Let's hope they didn't anger the dragon to kill the girl. That's always bad for pay.\" Before Hanna could reply anything regarding the morals of this statement, Arik had already unsheathed his sword and walked on. \"Maybe the dragon moved to a different lair after they found him.\" Hanna offered after several more minutes of silent walking. \"Possible.\" Arik grumbled in return. \"Depends on how wounded he is. Could be that he just crawled as deep into the earth as he could, hoping that the next folks Suddenly, he stopped, tilting his head in the air. \"What Arik raised his sword, motioning Hanna to hush. \"I heard a voice.\" His whisper was now hardly louder than a breath of air. \"Could be the princess.\" Hanna strained her ears, tiptoeing forward. \"Kill the light.\" With the will of her thought, Hanna extinguished the magical fire in her staff, letting absolute darkness fall over them. For a few seconds they remained like this, immobile and without making a sound until they could hear footsteps. \"I could swear there was a light...\" The voice of a girl not too far away. Filled with fright. \"But there's nothing. It didn't look like fire, either.\" Worry and confusion seemed to fight a battle in her mind, when Arik cut through it. \"Princess Mika?\" A gasp. \"GO AWAY!\" Faster footsteps now, veering away from them. \"Princess!\" Hanna could hear him take off after her. \"NO! LEAVE US ALONE! I don't want to be rescued!\" Hanna ran as fast as her feet would carry her, chasing the heavy steps of Arik, somewhere in front of her. She was too close to react when she heard him stumble, his roar as he fell not enough warning for her not to follow him. With a groan, she went down beside him. \"Fuck.\" \"You hurt?\" \"No. Well. I hit my head, but I don't think it's too bad.\" \"Good. Can you turn the light back on?\" \"You think that's a good idea?\" \"I'm not keen on falling on my face again.\" \"Alright.\" The light seemed to return a little apprehensively. Shedding light on the stone walls beside and in front of them. They could now see that the cave bent to the left in a few feet's distance. \"Let's go.\" Arik picked himself up by his sword, sighing as he came to a stand. \"I already hate that girl.\" \"You scared her. I would run too if you screamed my name and I didn't know you.\" Arik did not give an answer, instead making his way to the bend in front of them, Hanna quickly following. As they made the turn, light from Hanna's staff filled the cave. As it seemed, they had finally found the heart of the cavern. And with it, the dragon. A creature three times larger than a horse, with a tail long enough to curl around a village well. The head big enough to halve a man with a single bite, adorned with a small horn between the nostrils. And all of it covered in dark scales the size of a man's hand. The large eyes now focused on them, as the dragon lifted his head to turn it to the entrance. In front of the beast, spreading her arms protectively, stood the princess. \"Don't come closer! Don't! Leave us!\" She picked up a rock on the ground and threw it. Arik calmly blocking it with his shield. \"You are talking mad, girl. Probably under the dragon's spell. Can they do that? Brainwash girls?\" \"Not that I'd know of.\" Hanna replied, glancing at him. \"Either way. You have to step aside. Let me take care of this so that we can brng you home!\" \"NO! You don't understand. I don't want to go home. I don't want you to kill him! I love him!\" For the first time Arik lowered his sword. \"What.\" \"I love him.\" Tears streaming down her face, she knelt down beside the creature, stroking its head. \"And they try to kill him. They hurt him. It's bad.\" \"But- It's a dragon.\" Arik's face was overcome with confusion. \"How can you love a dragon.\" \"He's not a dragon. I mean- He's a dragon now but he wasn't before. He's a prince!\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"His name is Samuel and he was cursed!\" \"By whom?\" Hanna chimed in now as Arik simply stared at the princess. \"There was another who came to my father to ask for my hand. But he was evil and spiteful and my father gave me to Samuel, because I love him. And that terrible boy was mad and threw a tantrum, tossing the gifts he made me in the river as he rode out of our castle.\" The princess took a moment to gather herself. Her tears were almost dried as the dragon, Samuel, put his wing over her side. Smiling sadly, Mika hugged the side of his head, taking a deep breath. Only then did she continue. \"They say his mother is a witch and that she gave his father a love potion to even marry her. And now she cursed Samuel so that he couldn't marry me!\" Okay. Obviously, I'm not finished. I'm going to continue this story tomorrow, this might get quite a bit longer. Hope there's somebody out there who enjoys this: D", "text_perturb": "`` Arik. Arik !

This place was much less meddling , but it is a start. He tilted the glass back , but a little too far and the cold water spilled out past the break between the glass and his face. Gerard leaped up and travel over his own two feet. He fell backward and dispatch his head on the ground. Unfortunately the injury was as well great for Gerard , and he bled out on the bar floor.

I remember seeing Mr. T, and I was so excited to have another big celebrity come to my tiny little bar, but after he ordered his drinks, he got kicked by a horse, and that's when a scuffle started, and soon after there was a bang, and OH GOD THE BLOOD!!! No, no, nonononono...\" The tears were coming even harder than before. The detective scratched his balding head. It seemed a few small pieces were coming together, but he didn't like the picture fragments he was seeing. He jotted a message to himself on his notepad- Remember to bring Mayor to precinct tmrw, need to get law regarding horses allowed in bars amended or struck down. With a sigh, he put his notepad away and nodded at the uniformed officer near the door to escort Mr. Hawn out. As he moved to his office, Detective Smith wore an expression that told his coworkers it was not a time for him to be disturbed. After settling at his desk, he glanced at some paperwork, quickly sucked in a gasp, and picked up the phone. One button press later, speed dial had connected him to his supervisor's line. \"Lt, it's Smith. No, the important Smith, not the one in accounting, you ass.

Calvery took a seat in Smith's office, the old leather chair squeaking in complaint as he slowly let his weight settle. \"Now this office brings back memories. Makes me want to get back out on the streets, catching baddies.\" Smith chuckled, said, \"Lt, with as much weight as you've put on I don't think you could catch anything.\" Calvery's mustache did not approve of such comments. \"Shut the fuck up and give me this'far-fetched' theory of yours. But take your time, I want to spend as much time away from my paperwork as possible.\" Smith's chuckle faded with his smile. \"It's not pretty, Lt. I got the full list of deceased from the coroner. We've ID'd the guy with the hat.\" Lt leaned forward. The case had been bizarre from the outset, with no clear theory on how the incident occurred, but the arson and crime scene investigators said it wasn't a normal explosion. Evidence of a fight was found, between a man now identified as Mr. T (of A-Team fame) and at least one horse, with other animals and people being dragged into the scuffle. However, before Washington County SWAT could come in, a Rabbi from Dallas who'd been arguing with a priest in a corner of the bar placed a call to the Texas Rangers. It was completely uncalled for, but what's done was done. Even stranger was the fact that not even 90 seconds after the call was placed, a Ranger appeared at the bar. Kicking down the door (which appeared to be the sound of the bang the barkeep reported), he entered the building- and all hell broke loose. \"The hat had a name stitched on the inside. It was Chuck Norris.\" Smith paused to let that sink in. Lt. Calvery's face went from confused, to pale, to horrified, to somber. It had all clicked into place for him, as it had for Smith only minutes earlier. \"My God..... and Mr. T. Both killed in such an avoidable tragedy.\" Lt leaned back in his chair. \"I think I know where you're going with this Smith.

{"original_text": "\" Shall we? \" Jim asked. \" Yeah, start it up, \" Frank said. Jim reached out and placed his hand on the glass box to his left. A thick, maroon button sat flush against the wall inside, accompanied by a long-since-dead fly. With his right hand, Jim lifted his ID badge from around his neck and grabbed the key hanging next to his picture. He bent forward slightly and slid it into the slot, then twisted it. The box clicked softly under his hand. He pulled upwards on the glass. \" Hope it works this time. \" Jim placed his hand against the button. It was cold against his palm; he could feel the soft bumps that layered the top of the button. He turned his head and glanced at Frank, then pushed down with a bit too much force as the button tapped the wall with a soft click. An alarm echoed through the laboratory as the large, blue orb ahead of them slowly began rotating with a mechanical hum. Jim flipped on the large medical light hanging above the orb, which dimmed the room's lighting as it grew in intensity. The orb began moving slightly closer to the light. \" Time? \" Frank asked, rolling two chairs closer to the orb. Jim glanced at his watch. \" 3:31pm, year one. \" He sat down in the chair, which rotated slightly under his weight. He stabilized himself with his legs, grabbed the clipboard on the desk next to him, and leaned forward. The orb was rotating rather quickly - Frank had insisted that they try a higher rate this time around. Nothing had to come to fruition in the previous two attempts, which Jim chalked up to simple miscalculations in temperature. Frank, however, was obstinate in the error being the speed at which they started. It simply turned too slowly, he said - speed was crucial for the beginning, not becoming irrelevant until after initial growth and when the light could correctly calibrate to the rotational rate. Jim suggested they dim the medical light to start rather than speed things up, but ultimately conceded. He knew full well that there was little point in arguing with Frank when he was set on something. They agreed upon a speed of roughly 30rpm to start, but had calibrated cameras to allow for specific, close-up viewings of certain areas to avoid having to consistently walk in circles. Jim squinted as he rolled closer to the orb, trying to allow his eyes to become accustomed to the rotations. \" Doesn't look like much is happening, \" he said. \" Give it some time, I think we're at the right speed now. We're only about a month in. \" The orb continued to rotate under the lamp. Its light caused a brilliant reaction wherever it hit, just as it had in previous tests. The water become a much more crisp blue, even completely clear in some areas; a warm amber spread over the landmasses whenever painted by light. The areas not under illumination quickly lost color, some became iced over at incredible rates as the orb moved further away. Jim noticed that both the top and the bottom of the orb were becoming almost entirely coated in a thick layer of ice and snow, as was one side of the orb. Unlike their last failed test, however, the ice was not spreading to the face tilted toward the lamp. He glanced up at Frank, who was writing on his clipboard. \" How long until it moves closer? \" Jim asked. \" Few more seconds, we're almost at its furthest point. \" Jim glanced back at the orb and leaned forward, placing his weight on his knees. He watched as the ice slowly spread down further from the poles of the orbs. The orb moved further and further as the ice extended out. He glanced back at Frank again. \" It's coming back, \" Frank said, rising to his feet and walking closer to the sphere. Jim stared as the orb made a noticeable movement back toward the light. The ice began receding back to the poles as the continent in the center slowly returned to an amber hue. \" I think it's working, \" Jim said. \" I told you it was the speed. I - \" Frank paused. \" Look. \" He pointed toward monitor on the left of the sphere. A small, green patch was beginning to form along the landmass. It began spreading across the continent. \" Is that a forest? \" Jim asked, standing from his seat and walking closer to the monitor. He placed his hand on the mouse below it and clicked. A camera twitched to life as the monitor slowly moved inward, bringing a thick green into view. \" That's a forest. That's a god damn forest, \" Frank said, walking over to Jim. \" Should we speed it up? \" Jim asked. Frank stood for a moment and stared at the monitor. \" Can we reproduce this? \" he asked. \" Yeah, we haven't really done anything other than turn it on. We can definitely start over if we need to. \" \" Let's do it, then. No point sitting here for an hour. \" Jim nodded and placed his hand back on the mouse, moving it slowly about the screen in front of him. He clicked on the speed and increased it dramatically. A low, gradual, mechanical growl echoed from behind them as the orb increased its rotation and pendulation. Jim turned and watched the orb. The green began to flourish and expand over the amber landmass. The ice remained relatively consistent. Slowly the land itself began to separate and move. Jim glanced at Frank, who was again writing on his clipboard, then returned his gaze toward the monitor. \" Hang on, \" Frank said. Jim clicked the mouse again. The mechanical growl slowed to its original hum. Frank pointed at the monitor. \" Do you see that? \" Jim squinted. Something was moving under the tree-line. He clicked the mouse and the camera again zoomed in. A large reptilian creature meandered across the monitor. \" Looks like we have an infestation, \" Frank said. \" Speed it back up, let's see what happens. \" Jim clicked the mouse again as the growl returned. The orb rotated furiously as the landscape slowly become increasingly covered in forest. The creatures were visible on the monitors, constantly being born and dying, each changing slightly from the last generation. Frank walked back the orb and stared into it, then popped a circular candy into his mouth. He had a terrible sweet tooth. \" These things are so hot, I - \" Frank began coughing. Jim turned toward him - he was doubled over, mouth buried in his hands as his body shook with each cough. Jim sighed and walked over, then smacked him on the back. The candy flew out of his mouth and smacked into the side of the orb. \" Oh shit, \" Jim said. The planet continued to spin as a chemical reaction spread across the planet. A fireball engulfed the orb for a split second, then immediately died out. Jim glanced at Frank. He was still staring at the orb. The green had been replaced by a thick, burnt black. \" Well, \" Frank said. \" I guess that's one way to get rid of the infestation. We ruined our plants, though. \" Jim nodded and glanced back at the orb. A flash of green caught his attention as it rotated aggressively. \" Maybe not, \" Jim said. The green spread across the globe, again flourishing as the orb moved toward the lamp. [ Well, I'm pretty done with this prompt haha, it got kind of out of hand. Didn't intend for it to be so long, so I'm just going to stop it here. Idea was eventually they'd decide to start over after wars took place, since they're just trying to build a new device for gardening or something. ]", "text_perturb": "`` Shall we ? `` Jim asked. `` Yeah , start it up , `` Frank read. Jim reached out and set his hand on the glass box to his left. A thick , maroon button sat boot against the wall inside , accompanied by a long-since-dead fly. With his proper hand , Jim lifted his ID badge from around his neck and grabbed the key hanging next to his picture. He bent forwards slightly and slid it into the slot , then twisted it. The box clicked softly under his mitt. He pulled upwards on the chalk. `` hope it works this time. `` Jim placed his hand against the clitoris. It was cold against his palm ; he could feel the soft bumps that layered the tip of the button. He release his head and glanced at Frank , then pushed down with a bit too much force as the button tapped the wall with a soft click. An alarm echoed through the laboratory as the large , blue orb ahead of them slowly began rotating with a mechanical hua. Jim flipped on the large medical light fall above the orb , which dimmed the room 's lighting as it grew in intensity. The globe began moving slightly closer to the light. `` Time ? `` weenie asked , rolling two chairs closer to the orb. Jim glanced at his watch. `` 3:31pm , twelvemonth one. `` He baby sit down in the chair , which rotated slightly under his weight. He stabilized himself with his legs , seize the clipboard on the desk next to him , and leaned forward. The orb was rotating rather quickly - Frank had insisted that they render a higher rate this time around. Nothing had to come to fruition in the previous two attempts , which Jim chalked up to unsubdivided miscalculations in temperature. Frank , however , was obstinate in the error be the speed at which they started. It simply turned too slowly , he said - speed was crucial for the beginning , not go irrelevant until after initial growth and when the light could correctly calibrate to the rotational rate. Jim suggested they slur the medical light to start rather than speed things up , but ultimately conceded. He knew full well that there was little point in debate with Frank when he was set on something. They agreed upon a speed of roughly 30rpm to start , but had calibrated cameras to allow for specific , close-up viewings of certain areas to avoid having to consistently walk in rope. Jim squint as he rolled closer to the orb , trying to allow his eyes to become accustomed to the rotations. `` come n't look like much is happening , `` he said. `` Give it some clip , I think we 're at the right speed now. We 're only about a month in. `` The ball continued to rotate under the lamp. Its light caused a brilliant reaction wherever it hit , scarce as it had in previous tests. The piss become a much more crisp blue , even completely clear in some areas ; a warm amber spread over the landmasses whenever painted by light. The arena not under illumination quickly lost color , some became iced over at incredible rates as the orb moved further away. Jim noticed that both the top and the bottom of the orb were becoming almost entirely coated in a thick layer of ice and c , as was one side of the orb. Unlike their last failed test , however , the ice was not spreading to the face tip toward the lamp. He glanced up at Frank , who follow writing on his clipboard. `` How long until it moves closer ? `` Jim asked. `` Few more seconds , we 're almost at its furthest period. `` Jim glanced back at the globe and leaned forward , placing his weight on his knees. He watched as the methamphetamine slowly spread down further from the poles of the orbs. The orb moved farther and farther as the ice extended out. He glanced backward at Frank again. `` It 's coming back , `` Frank said , rising to his feet and walking cheeseparing to the sphere. Jim stared as the orb made a noticeable front back toward the light. The ice began receding back to the poles as the continent in the center slowly returned to an gold hue. `` I suppose it 's working , `` Jim said. `` I enjoin you it was the speed. I - `` wiener paused. `` see. `` He pointed toward monitoring device on the left of the sphere. A small , green patch was beginning to form along the land mass. It start spreading across the continent. `` Is that a forest ? `` Jim asked , put up from his seat and walking closer to the monitor. He locate his hand on the mouse below it and clicked.

That 's a supreme being damn forest , `` Frank said , walking over to Jim. `` Should we speed it up ? `` Jim asked. hotdog stood for a moment and stared at the monitor. `` Can we reproduce this ? `` he necessitate. `` Yeah , we have n't really done anything other than ferment it on. We give the axe definitely start over if we need to. `` `` army of the pure 's do it , then. No point sitting here for an time of day. `` Jim nodded and placed his hand back on the mouse , act it slowly about the screen in front of him. He clicked on the speed and increase it dramatically. A low , gradual , mechanical growl echoed from behind them as the ball increased its rotation and pendulation. Jim deform and watched the orb. The green began to flourish and extend over the amber landmass. The ice remained relatively coherent. Slowly the land itself began to ramify and move.

For any one who doesn't know, this means I receive my first Pokemon today and begin my journey towards becoming a Pokemon master. Although this is a happy day, I almost almost a little sad. Can you keep a secret? Okay, good. I've always been a curious child. We have never met the people on the other side of the wall and are forbidden to do so. As a child I would walk along the wall, or just sit in the grass staring at it, while I listened to the sounds beyond it. One day as I circled, I found some niches in the wall that allowed me to climb to the top. I had tried some of the trees, but the masters were pretty good about pruning any branches towards the ground. And you know, 10 year olds do not have the most impressive upper body strength to slither up a tree trunk. Anyways. That day was a magical day. I sat on top of the wall for hours just watching the people of the other side. They were the most interesting sorts. They're pets don't seem to have any special powers. A lot have four legs and make weird sounds. They almost look like Persian and Growlithe, or maybe Meowth. But they have a lot of Hoothoots and Noctowls flying around. It looks like those are used to deliver their mail. The most incredible part is their powerful sticks! They don't need a charizard to bring fire, or a squirtle for blasts of water! All they do is wave their stick around in the air and yell words and then it happens! I watched this the most. I see people point at something and say \"ACCIO\" and it brings it right to them! Some of the more talented people did this with knives and sharp things..... but I don't think I am THAT brave. I climb the wall again today. My last day of watching. My branch sits next to me on the ledge and I try another command that I've heard. I set a leaf next to me and point my stick at it and say \"DIFFINDO.\" Nothing. Again. Every once in a while I think I see a tear in the leaf, but definitely nothing to the extent of the prank I once saw where one kid ripped another kids pants into shreds just by saying those words. Oh well. This is why it is my last day of watching the people on the other side. I've seen the children receive letters for their schools on their 10th birthday also. We only have Professor Oak, but they have lots of schools that they can go to! I see some that get letters from multiple schools and so they have a big decision to make! Most only get one letter, and some don't get any letter at all. The families still love their children though even if they don't get to go to school. We haven't had anyone not receive a Pokemon on their 10th birthday for many centuries. I am not sure how my family would react if I did not receive one. But I know how they would feel if I got one of those school letters. One child received a school letter on their 10th birthday according to my mother's grandmother's grandmother. The family of that child banished him for choosing the strange school over our normal way of life with the Pokemons. But how cool would it be to be able to spit fire out a tree branch?! Or to be able to call something to me without moving! That would sure make capturing all of the Pokemon's a breeze! Oh well. My life has been chosen for me. I should go back in to town now and receive my Pokemon. I reach the bottom of the wall and make my way out of the woods. I hear a strange noise above me. It is one of the HootHoots from the other side! They never fly over the wall! The HootHoot flies straight towards me and drops a tan envelope in my hand and flies off. There has to be some mistake. The HootHoot needs to come back and take this to the right child!

{"original_text": "Somewhere deep in the heart of Zaire, 1987 - The rusty old jeep bounced along the gravel road. The green paint that had once covered it had given way to grey metal, rust and mud. The only visible marking on the jeep was a faded'W', that had been painted blue long ago. The driver sat with an ease that comes from an adventurous spirit and a lifetime of driving dangerously. The skin on his dark face crinkled as he smiled, looking at the hot African sun through his sunglasses and listening to the music blasting out of the radio. It was a beautiful day. By contrast, the woman who sat beside him was pale, and covered her arms with a long sleeved shirt. She had a map stretched over her knees, and was studying it intently, tapping a pen against her mouth as she did so. \"Jakob\" She called over the roar of the engine. The man smiled and turned down the radio. \"Yes?\" The woman pointed to a clearing in the jungle that ran beside them. \"Turn there, please\" Jakob smirked and spun the wheel. The dusty old Range Rover turned right onto the track, and the sun disappeared. The thick canopy blocked out the sun, creating the sensation of night. It was much cooler in the jungle, something Jakob was thankful for. It meant that they wouldn't have to exhaust their water trying to keep hydrated, and the engine wouldn't overheat like last time. He twisted the volume button on the radio, and let the heavy sounds of Led Zepplin crash over him. - Jakob Nyathi had been born in Freetown, in 1965, just a few years after Sierra Leone had become independent. He had one brother born before him, and one brother and two sisters born after him. They had moved south to Liberia in'68, after Stevens assumed control of the government again. His father had seen the displeasure the public felt, and had decided that the country was a powder keg waiting to blow. He hadn't been wrong. Luckily, Liberia was relatively stable. His father had gotten a job as a policeman, while his mother worked at a local hospital as a nurse. It was helping his mother with the patients at the hospital that caused him to decide to become a doctor. He liked the feeling that he was making a difference in people's lives. Doctor Jakob Nyathi had a certain ring to it that he liked, as well. He had graduated from the University of Liberia medical school in 1984, at the age of 19, barely a few months before the army destroyed it. Jakob went to work immediately for the WHO, providing medical help in poorer regions of Africa. Zaire was just a small stop-off on the way to East Africa. Barely an hour had passed after their plane had landed, before they were told to visit a small village on the outskirts of the impenetrable Congo jungle. - Sarah Johnstone, or Sally, had grown up completely opposite to Jakob. Born in Atlanta in 1959, to wealthy parents, she wouldn't have had to work hard to have a good life. But she did. She graduated from Atlanta High at 17, and then graduated Harvard medical School four years later. An internship at the CDC during those years had given her substantial experience in the field of virology, and her medical training meant that she had an eye for viruses and knew how to deal with them. Which was a good thing to know how to do in an AIDS-ravaged Africa. - \"Do you speak their language?\" Sally asked. Jakob smiled. \"The national language of Zaire is French, but many people in this region speak Lingala or Swahili. I don't know any Lingala or Swahili, but I can speak a little French. It doesn't matter anyway, we have this guy\" Jakob backhanded a blanket on the backseat. A cry erupted. \"What happened? Where are we? Are we there yet?\" An African man shot his head out from under the blanket, his eyes both opened wide in alarm and covered in sleep. He blinked a few times, and looked around at his surroundings. \"Yo, Frere, how far out are we?\" \"About 10 klicks, Paul. You can go back to sleep if you wish,\" Jakob laughed, \"though I don't know how you managed to sleep with this noise.\" Paul Jerre laughed. \"Surely you should know that I can sleep through anything Jakob. Even that horrible noise you make when you sleep\" Sally reread the information they had been given. A young boy had been checked into a WHO hospital 38 kilometres from where he lived. He had acute symptoms, of a disease that was not currently classified. The distraught parents of the boy had told nurses that he had been fine the previous day. The next day he had died. From the little that the parents had been told by the boy, which they had relayed to the staff of the hospital, was that the boy had been exploring some caves in the north the day before he had become sick. Sally, Jakob and Paul had been told to find what had caused the illness. Initial analysis had suggested it was a virus. It was extremely lethal, but not very infective, relying on blood transmission to jump between hosts. After the trio had found the origin of the virus, samples they were to take would be flown to three different laboratories; the CDC, WHO headquarters and the Munroe base in Antarctica. From there, a vaccine to the virus would hopefully be created, and another threat to human existence would be lost to the history books. - The village was small. A few huts huddled together in the clearing, like a group of penguins trying to protect themselves from the cold. Sunlight reflected from a waterfall in the distance, and the sound of nature penetrated everywhere. Jakob stopped the engine and pulled the key from the ignition. He jumped out of the jeep and walked to the back. Paul pulled a backpack from underneath the blanket and walked towards the village. A group of children stopped the impromptu game of football they had been playing and ran towards him, shouting and smiling in the innocent way that only children can. He called a greeting in Swahili, and they responded in kind. Jakob smiled at the sight, then resumed pulling boxes out of the back. \"It's beautiful.\" Sally's voice interrupted his thoughts. \"The way they aren't letting the death of one of them stop their happiness. The way they keep on living.\" Jakob grunted in agreement. \"The resilience of children. If only adults could do the same. Maybe this continent would't be at war all the time. Then we could do something about everyone's health.\" He picked up two of the boxes by their handles and moved towards the village. Sally smiled and grabbed the other two. \"That would be a huge step forward for humanity. Unfortunately, I don't think that's a step some people want to take. There's too much money to be made to stop the exploitation of this place.\" \"Tell me about it. Gold, diamonds, ivory, oil. Africa's resources are going to be her downfall.\" They set the boxes on the ground, in the shadow of one of the huts. Sally surveyed the village. \"I'm going to get Paul, and then find someone in charge. We'll probably be able to start after that.\" Jakob nodded in acknowledgement.

{"original_text": "You blinked. How did you end up here? One minute, you were finishing up the final stretch of the new road that you were Atomizing, and the next, you're here. Wherever'here' is. You sigh, looking down. A road, it was, not unlike the one you were making not too long ago. You see the Atomizer in your left hand, too. Good. That thing was expensive, the Empire would never let you hear the end of it if you lost it, no matter how far away you flew. Space wasn't as big as humanity once thought. Besides, it was somewhat comforting to have it. You've been working for the Paving Department for a long time, the tool was your only constant in life. Well, that, and the fact that Nellie would never see you as more than a friend. The single life had been a smidge too cruel, you thought, letting Nellie get as close to you as she could without actually being in a relationship with her. You knew she was the one for you, felt it deep down in your soul, but she never hinted at anything more than friends. You didn't want to ruin that, though, so you stayed quiet. You shook away those thoughts, and looked up, finding yourself at a crossroads. Two roads split away from the one you were on, a'T' in the road. A letter was floating in place just before the road divided, the old kind with paper and stamps. You walked up to it, the Atomizer's vials of Synthetic Matter sloshing as you did so. You reached out to the letter, and grabbed it. It wasn't a hologram, then. It had been decades since these were used, but opening the thing wasn't rocket science. You ripped apart the paper, and inside the envelope found a single sheet of silvery paper. My regards, Edward Haldey. I am the cosmic being known as Fate, and I have selected you to take my place in deciding the course of human history. Your eyes widened. What the hell was going on? You see, influencing every single little choice every living thing makes can take a lot out of someone. Every couple of millenia, I'll make one of you matterbags do it for me- no offense. Your choice here is a relatively simple one. Walk down the left road, and Earth will be burnt to the ground in nuclear fire. An accident with your latest attempts to safely split atoms will result in a shockwave that detonates every nuclear device on Earth. Your hands began to shake. Why in the hell would he do that? Of course, if you do this then you'll have Nellie. At this, you stopped shaking immediantly. Oh god. I'll place the both of you in Earth's orbit to safely observe the fireworks, inside the fastest ship your Empire has developed. From there, you can go to any of the colony worlds, but Earth will burn to ashes. She'll realize that she does have feelings for you, and you will be together the rest of your lives. Well what happened if you walked down the right path then? Walk down the right path, however, and Earth will be spared. Your test will prove sucessful, and a new wave of technology will sweep the Empire. Nellie, however, will be transported here, in front of you. A gun will appear in your hands, and you will pull the trigger. Thrice. You will shoot her in the head, the heart, and the lungs. No. This couldn't be real. Your hands started shaking again. You have as much time as you need, Edward. Everything is frozen outside this realm. You will make a choice, however. That much is certain. Best Regards, Fate Excelsius Elizabeth Augustine Jr. You dropped the silver paper, and it floated to return where the letter had been originally. You looked around, frantic to find something other than the road, but there was nothing but green fields as far as he could see. There was no way you could decide. You could never live with yourself in either situation. These couldn't be the only two options! ..... That last thought stuck with you. You had worked in the Paving Department for ten years, and if there was one thing you had learned, it was that there was always another path. Sometimes, you had to make that path yourself. You gripped your Atomizer firmly, and walked to the crossroads. Holding it as you had a thousand times before- hand steady, arms out, fingers away from the end- you did what you did best. You made a damn road. A center road, one that kept going forward instead of to the other side. Your mind raced as you sprayed down the Synthetic Matter, the gooey substance taking shape and hardening into a proper paved road. There were three factors to each option: Earth, Nellie, and yourself. If each option killed off one of them, then that meant there was an option that killed off yourself- but left Nellie and Earth alive and well. A third road, another option. You couldn't live with destroying either of those things, but you would gladly give your life for them. If this'Fate' bastard didn't understand that, then he was a shitty cosmic being. Another silver sheet of paper appeared after about fifteen feet of road. Well, it seems you aren't the dull-minded laborer I took you for. I like that about you. I won't stop you if this is want. Don't be suprised if I come and visit you in the afterlife. I might like someone to work with. Oh, and I'll tell Nellie how you felt, and that you'll be alright.

After he had been down there almost 16 hours the door suddenly opened and Deluc was discovered comatose on the other side.

{"original_text": "\"d'Ours. Step forward if you will.\" Albatross d'Ours' expression was blank as all the eyes in the court chamber turned towards him, waiting for his reaction. To his credit he held himself with great dignity, despite the several cups of poteen he had during the meal. He rose from where he sat at the long low table, walking over to where his lord sat in place of pride at the head. All the courtiers and visitors gazes' followed him as he passed by increasingly ranking nobles. d'Ours' own mint green eyes were leveled at the painted screen ahead of him, not once shifting. From the corner of his eye he could see Lord Asano's daughter Kumiko willing her face to be emotionless, eyes cast down to avoid betraying anything she might be thinking. Her hair was dyed whiter than the purest snow, a jade comb pinning a portion of it up. Just outside of sword reach he stopped, falling to his knees as he bowed. \"How may I serve you, my lord?\" d'Ours asked, forehead against the clean straw mat that made up the floor. \"Rise, and tell my honored guests your story, and how one of such..... fairness came to my court.\" His Lord Asano instructed him. d'Ours looked out over the intrigued guests, curiosity clear on their faces despite their best efforts of hiding it. d'Ours inhaled through his nose, taking in the lingering scents of the meal and burning incense, mind fading back to memories like the mist and dew, pure and clean from pollution. \"My name is Albatross d'Ours of the Xaxon Tribe. My father was Harrier d'Ours, noted Air Corsair of the Ursine, and had two hundred swords at his command. Fourteen years ago he ran afoul of picket ships which precipitated the Xaxon-Nithon War. The Nithon of course were victorious during the war, and as part of the peace-talks I was placed under my Lord Asano's tutelage as assurance. Coming to the Westwind at the age of two, my entire life has been with the Nithon. I have no memories of my prior life with the Xaxons and have grown up thinking of myself as one of the people despite my obvious differences. Lord Asano has made sure I have wanted for nothing, and has been a most generous lord.\" d'Ours made a bow in his direction. The lord spoke immediately afterwards. \"Young Albatross d'Ours has been almost like a son to me, and has shown only the greatest loyalty and dedication to the clan. While unorthodox, it is certainly not unheard of, and so it will be my pleasure to formally induct d'Ours into the clan at his coming of age. Kumiko,\" He addressed her with a motion of his hand beckoning her forward. \"is much like her mother; headstrong, talented, and beautiful. She is blessed by the spirits, able to communicate and summon them. She will be a potent asset to the clan. But such a powerful individual is one surrounded by those who'd want to do her harm.\" The assembled lords nodded. Those with the gifts of the spirits and mages were rare and coveted, and in battle one of the principal objectives was the elimination of the enemy's magic users. One mage lending their power to a force was worth a hundred warriors in combat. \"You, d'Ours have grown into the man I admire; brave, skilled, and above all, loyal. Albatross d'Ours. Do you promise to serve as yojimbo to my daughter, to safeguard her life and soul from all who would do her harm, even from her husband?\" \"I do, my lord.\"", "text_perturb": "`` d'Ours.

From the turning point of his eye he could see Lord Asano 's daughter Kumiko willing her face to be emotionless , eyes cast down to avoid betraying anything she might be thinking. Her hair was dyed whiter than the purest snow , a loose woman comb pinning a portion of it up. Just outside of sword reach he stopped , pass to his knees as he bowed. `` How may I serve you , my lord ?

My father live Harrier d'Ours , noted Air Corsair of the Ursine , and had two hundred swords at his command. Fourteen eld ago he ran afoul of picket ships which precipitated the Xaxon-Nithon War. The Nithon of course were victorious during the war , and as part of the peace-talks I was placed under my Lord Asano 's tutelage as pledge. occur to the Westwind at the age of two , my entire life has been with the Nithon. I have no memories of my anterior life with the Xaxons and have grown up thinking of myself as one of the people despite my obvious differences. god almighty Asano has made sure I have wanted for nothing , and has been a most generous lord. `` d'Ours pull in a bow in his direction. The lord mouth immediately afterwards. `` Young Albatross d'Ours has been almost like a son to me , and has shown solely the greatest loyalty and dedication to the clan. While unorthodox , it be certainly not unheard of , and so it will be my pleasure to formally induct d'Ours into the clan at his coming of age. Kumiko , '' He addressed her with a motion of his deal beckoning her forward. `` is much like her female parent ; headstrong , talented , and beautiful. She is blessed by the spirits , able to pass along and summon them. She will exist a potent asset to the clan. But such a powerful individual constitute one surrounded by those who 'd want to do her harm. `` The assembled lords nodded. Those with the gifts of the spirits and mages were rare and coveted , and in battle one of the principal objectives was the elimination of the foeman 's magic users. One mage lending their power to a force was worth a hundred warrior in combat. `` You , d'Ours have grown into the man I admire ; brave out , skilled , and above all , loyal. mollymawk d'Ours. Do you promise to serve as yojimbo to my daughter , to safeguard her life and soul from all who would do her harm , even from her husband ? '' `` I do , my divine. ``", "label": 1}

As Professor Stone shuffled nervously through the door into the gloom, his eyes began to adjust. The space was deceptively small and put him in the mood of a storeroom. One small window was covered, and the lamp had been removed from the ceiling. The only light he had to guide himself came from the dim glow of some black-lights, which had been arranged around the object, along with a sophisticated toolbox. He almost tripped, and looked down to find thick cables snaked from the lights to outlets on the walls. It was quiet, and yet he almost felt as though someone was breathing on his neck. The hairs on the back of his arms began to stand on end. He turned to the curly haired agent, who had entered behind him. \"Why are there no decent lights in here?\" he said. \"We'd rather people didn't take any decent photographs yet.\" said the agent. The professor noticed his name-tag said Evans. \"Besides, something about it disturbs people when they look at it in the light.\" Stone had to admit to himself that he understood what they meant. Even in this limited light, the probe felt foreboding, like it took up too much room for the size it was. When you tried to look away, your eyes couldn't help but slide back. He shivered. He felt like it was going to pounce. Which was absurd. It was a machine, not some alien creature. He suddenly wished very fervently that he hadn't thought of that. \"I'll be back later, Doc.\" said Evans, his voice a long drawl. \"Remember, just check it out and give us your opinion on whether it's the real deal.\" Before Stone could ask any questions the man was gone. A feeling stole over him that he wasn't the first to have done this. It would only make sense, he wasn't exactly the greatest expert on Voyager 1. He glanced at it. Was it Voyager 1? It certainly looked right, at least from the outside. He sighed, and rolled up his sleeves. Some hours later, Agent Evans returned to find the Professor sat carefully against a wall, looking tired.

The look in his eyes could give a man nightmares. \"The Golden Record gave us some hints.\" \"Can I see it?\" said Stone, eagerness pouring out of him like a tap. \"Any differences?\" \"Well, it's busy elsewhere at the moment,\" said Evans, his tone hollow. \"Still, I'll tell you some things. None of the languages match anything we know. Even the top linguists can't trace them to anything common.\" He paused. His face was taking on a waxy sheen. \"The music, well that was just noise. Screeching and deep rumbling. Either the record was damaged, or...\" his voice trailed off. \"What about the images?\" said Stone, almost against his will.

{"original_text": "Sleep had become increasingly difficult as of late, my dreams plagued by an endless whisper for attention. I knew what the voice wanted, what it needed, but I refused to listen. There was so much I hadn't done yet. I recalled my new bucketlist, the one I had created after I learned I was next in line for a Life Switch. It was a petty thing to do, to make a list of what I wanted to do before I die, after I learned I was to die, but I needed a way to focus and stay alive, after all. I toss and turned in my bed, willing myself to stay awake, but my body arguing with my pleas to stay awake. Fighting cancer had a way to wear a body out quickly. I shut and opened each eye in succession, but never together. It was next to impossible to keep them both open, but too possible to close them both. I willed myself to think about my day tomorrow, my week next week, my next month, how far I would get, how long I would get, the different plans I had made to travel and see the sights I had decided I always wanted to see, the different places I wanted to go, and I thought I could go without too much effort. This was a mistake, I quickly realized, letting my brain drift off on a tangent, because I found myself wandering the places I was thinking about, and I found myself floating through a dream pool, without even realizing I had done the one thing I didn't want to do. I casually walked an empty street in Paris in my head, or what I thought a street in Paris might look like, I had never been. My hands were in my pockets, the familiar smells wafted into my nostrils, or at least, what I thought familiar smells would be. The temperature was perfect, and so was the sky. There was no one in sight, and I had pure painless solitude for the first time in months. I found myself sighing happily, and giving the first sincere smile I had given since I found out about my death sentence, and wandered casually. It was a paradise, until the whispers began again. They always began when I didn't want them too. I knew what it was, it was the Life Switcher, the next soul in line to take my place on the physical plane. It lived in a limbo until my soul departed from the physical, and it could take my place in the population, so to speak. Once we had reached a certain population, births stopped unless someone was dying somewhere. Of course, it took us a few decades and censuses to figure out, but when we realized out population was staying exactly where it was for years straight, we knew we had tapped whatever ethereal resources were in charge of giving us a battery. It almost goes without saying that a lot of people's belief systems were easily destroyed with this concept, but there were new ones created, and some preserved. Many people refused to accept the concept because that very much proved death was inevitable, and laid out the concept very clearly. Many, like myself included, have a lot of trouble with facing our deaths as a necessary and unavoidable subject, and so we had become increasingly bitter at the fact. I knew I was next because I was a terminal patient with the nagging whispers. They usually start when you have less than year left, it's almost as if they can latch on and know when you're going to die. It's frightening at first, knowing your time is soon, and it is still just as frightening as it was three months ago. I wasn't ready then, I wasn't ready now. The whispers disagreed with me, and steadily their siren song floated into my ears, casually whispering the dooming sweet-nothings I had heard everytime I slept for the last three months. I vowed I would ignore it until the time came that I was satisfied with my life. I also vowed that I would never be satisfied. If I don't give up my place, then I don't have to die, not yet. This argument had worked for a time, but tonight, the Switcher had decided that I was no longer in charge of my time, and was making it harder and harder to ignore it's calls, it was getting louder, shriller, and closer than it ever had before. I should have known then that I was on death's doorstep, but I was delusional, and I thought I was more precious than this. I found myself half walking, half running in my dream, the feeling of running through water was very clear and present while I was trying to escape, and as always in every nightmare, the one thing you are running from caught up eventually, I could feel it's cold fingers on my shoulder; but they weren't cold. In fact, they were warm, and almost inviting, as if my father was clasping my shoulder in pride. I was stopped, but because I was in a dream, I had no momentum, no forward motion, so I just..... Stopped, and I was turned around to face the most striking eyes I had ever seen. They were every color, and they were no color. He had the same skin tone I did, the same smile I did, and the same height I do. I felt calm with him, happy in fact, that he had caught up finally. \"You can stop running, it's alright. You still get a choice.\" I thought to myself, as my dream turned less into a lucid dream, and more into what felt like reality. \"I get a choice?\" This was news to me, I had never heard of anyone dealing with a Switcher and surviving the aftermath. \"Of course, you're still a free willed being. We can't just take your life, we would be the very antithesis of human life, removing all choice from you.\" This was an interesting philosophy. I had never thought about our choices and free will having this much impact on my future. \"I know what you're thinking, and it's because death is not the end for you. There is no end for you when you choose to switch with me. You never top existing, and you can still see the things and do the things you always want to, and always wanted to since before you were you.\" If I were walking, I would have paused. Instead, I just opened my mouth slightly, unable to truly form a response. He continued casually; \"we are not grim reapers, and we are not asking for 2 pennies to cross the river of Styx. We know that every biological life is precious and beautiful, even if the owner doesn't truly see it until it is too late. We simply understand when your body is going to stop and we can take your place on the physical plane.\" He smiled, grabbed my wrist, and started pulling me gently, but excitedly, like a child wanting to show their father something they created in the other room. \"Let us walk, and I can tell you why it's time and how we can move on so that you may rest finally.\" Rest sounded very good, I thought to myself, I haven't had rest since the diagnoses. \"I know,\" he replied, as if my thoughts had spoken out loud. \"Let me show you my favorite place in these dreams, and you will understand.\" Everything morphed and grew into the night sky, our path became the milky way galaxy, the stars in the distance, illuminating those eyes that I had first seen, the nebula's and galaxies giving colors to our skin and my imagination that I had never seen. \"Nothing important here, I just love the sight,\" he said through a friendly laugh, and stopped in the middle of the path that he had created on the milky way. \"Listen, I know death is hard to accept, and I understand it is. I have had to accept it too, but so have you. We have accepted it hundreds of times, and we will for the rest of eternity. It's part of how our soul learns. We have experiences in life, which we take through death. Have you ever noticed how sometimes you just know things? How dealing with certain things, or skills just come naturally to you? How you treat something like you have had experience with it before, but have never in your life touched it?\" I thought about it hard, and nodded slowly as I came to realize certain things came easily to me, but I had no clue how. \"It's the perfect concept of free will, and sentience. The more we experience, the more we learn, and the more we learn, the more we try to experience. Life and death are just cycles in our choices, but neither are truly the final choice. Life is just another step in our infinite learning process. Like the edges of space, we go on forever.\" I was enthralled at this concept, mostly because it felt familiar, and partially because he had such an easy and welcoming tone about it, it was as if I was explaining it to myself. Like I was having an introspective conversation about a big decision I was going to be making. \"Exactly,\" he exclaimed out loud. I jumped a little, not expecting him to answer, because I wasn't used to him knowing what I was thinking. \"Exactly, what?\" I said, this being the first thing I had said out loud. \"That is the point I was building up to. You are dying, yes, but I am not replacing you. You are replacing yourself. Your choices and needs and wants and experiences are going to move forward through a new biological life, through new eyes, but with the same old ethereal being that has floated through this universe for as long as time has existed.\" I thought about this for a minute, letting the concept float through my head, half understanding, and half confused. He stood on the galaxy line, smiling, eyes filled with a million non-colors, and galaxies spinning gently around us, stars flickering, and comets falling softly. Then I slowly began to realize what he was truly saying. \"Wait a second, you aren't switching with me, or replacing me. You are...\" \"You, yes.\" He finished my sentence with a smaller glimmer in his universal eyes. \"Then how come...\" \"How come the population rose for a long time before plateauing? Because some of us didn't want to be physical bodies for a long time. We were content with floating through the universe and learning what we could observe, but having a life filled with finality has a way of showing you things you can not learn while being infinite.\" \"How long have I been...\" \"Physical?\" He continued to finish my sentences as if we were melding into one.\" \"We learned early on that being alive was beautiful.\" TBC", "text_perturb": "Sleep had become progressively difficult as of late , my dreams plagued by an endless whisper for attention.

I willed myself to think about my day tomorrow , my week next week , my next month , how far I would get , how long I would get , the different plans I had made to travel and see the sights I had decided I always desire to see , the different places I desire to go , and I thought I could go without too much effort. This was a mistake , I quickly substantiate , letting my brain drift off on a tangent , because I found myself wandering the places I was thinking about , and I found myself floating through a dream pool , without even realizing I had done the one thing I did n't want to do. I casually walk an empty street in Paris in my head , or what I thought a street in Paris might look like , I had never been. My hands represent in my pockets , the familiar smells wafted into my nostrils , or at least , what I thought familiar smells would be. The temperature was double dyed , and so was the sky. There was no ace in sight , and I had pure painless solitude for the first time in months. I found myself suspire happily , and giving the first sincere smile I had given since I found out about my death sentence , and wandered casually. It exist a paradise , until the whispers began again. They always set out when I did n't want them too. I knew what it was , it was the life time Switcher , the next soul in line to take my place on the physical plane. It lived in a limbo until my soul departed from the strong arm , and it could take my place in the population , so to speak. Once we had reached a certain population , births stopped unless someone was buy the farm somewhere. Of course , it took us a few decades and censuses to figure out , but when we realized out population was staying exactly where it was for years straight , we knew we had tapped whatever ethereal resources were in charge of give way us a battery. It almost goes without saying that a lot of people 's belief systems were easily destroyed with this construct , but there were new ones created , and some preserved. Many people refused to accept the concept because that very much proved death represent inevitable , and laid out the concept very clearly. Many , like myself included , have a lot of trouble with facing our deaths as a necessary and unavoidable subject , and so we had become increasingly vitriolic at the fact. I knew I was next because I was a terminal affected role with the nagging whispers. They commonly start when you have less than year left , it 's almost as if they can latch on and know when you 're going to die. It 's frightening at first , knowing your time is presently , and it is still just as frightening as it was three months ago. I was n't quick then , I was n't quick now. The whispers disagreed with me , and steady their siren song floated into my ears , casually whispering the dooming sweet-nothings I had heard everytime I slept for the last three months. I vowed I would dismiss it until the time came that I was satisfied with my life. I besides vowed that I would never be satisfied. If I do n't give up my place , then I do n't have to die , non yet. This parameter had worked for a time , but tonight , the Switcher had decided that I was no longer in charge of my time , and was making it harder and harder to ignore it 's calls , it was getting louder , shriller , and closer than it ever had before. I should have known then that I was on dying 's doorstep , but I was delusional , and I thought I was more precious than this. I found myself half walking , half running in my dream , the feeling of running through water was very clear and present while I was trying to escape , and as always in every nightmare , the one thing you are running from caught up eventually , I could feel it 's stale fingers on my shoulder ; but they were n't stale. In fact , they were warm , and almost inviting , as if my father was clasping my shoulder in superbia. I cost stopped , but because I cost in a dream , I had no momentum , no forward motion , so I just. . . . . Stopped , and I was grow around to face the most striking eyes I had ever seen. They were every colour , and they were no colour. He had the same skin tone I exercise , the same smile I exercise , and the same height I do. I felt calm with him , happy in fact , that he had trance up finally. `` You can stop track , it 's alright. You still get a option. `` I thought to myself , as my dream turned less into a lucid dream , and more into what felt like world. `` I get a choice ? '' This was news to me , I had never heard of anyone dealing with a Switcher and pull through the aftermath. `` Of course , you 're still a free leave being. We ca n't just select your life , we would be the very antithesis of human life , removing all choice from you. `` This was an interesting school of thought. I had never thought about our choices and free will having this much impingement on my future. `` I know what you 're thinking , and it 's because death is not the oddment for you. There is no terminal for you when you choose to switch with me. You never top existing , and you tin still see the things and do the things you always want to , and always wanted to since before you were you. `` If I were walking , I would have pause. or else , I just opened my mouth slightly , unable to truly form a response. He continued casually ; `` we are non grim reapers , and we are non asking for 2 pennies to cross the river of Styx. We know that every biological life is precious and beautiful , even if the owner does n't truly interpret it until it is too late. We simply understand when your body is going to stop and we can take your place on the physical carpenters plane. `` He smiled , grabbed my wrist , and started pulling me gently , but excitedly , like a child require to show their father something they created in the other room. `` Let us walk , and I can severalize you why it 's time and how we can move on so that you may rest finally. `` Rest sounded very proficient , I thought to myself , I have n't had rest since the diagnoses. `` I bang , '' he replied , as if my thoughts had spoken out loud. `` Let me show you my favorite place in these dreams , and you will realize. `` Everything morphed and grew into the night sky , our path became the milky way galaxy , the stars in the distance , illuminating those eyes that I had first catch , the nebula 's and galaxies giving colors to our skin and my imagination that I had never catch. `` Nothing important here , I just love the sight , '' he said through a friendly laugh , and stopped in the middle of the path that he had created on the milky mode. `` Listen , I know death is hard to accept , and I interpret it is. I have had to accept it too , but then have you. We have accepted it hundreds of times , and we will for the rest of timeless existence. It 's part of how our soul learns. We have experiences in aliveness , which we take through death. Have you ever noticed how sometimes you just know things ? How dealing with certain things , or skills just come naturally to you ? How you treat something like you have had experience with it before , but have never in your life partake it ? '' I thought about it hard , and nodded slowly as I came to realize certain things came easily to me , but I had no clue how. `` It 's the perfect concept of detached will , and sentience. The to a greater extent we experience , the to a greater extent we learn , and the to a greater extent we learn , the to a greater extent we try to experience. Life and death are just cycle in our choices , but neither are truly the final choice. Life is but another step in our infinite learning process. Like the boundary of space , we go on forever. `` I was enchant at this concept , mostly because it felt familiar , and partially because he had such an easy and welcoming tone about it , it was as if I was explaining it to myself. Like I was having an introspective conversation about a big decision I was extend to be making. `` Exactly , '' he proclaim out loud. I jumped a little , not expecting him to answer , because I was n't apply to him knowing what I was thinking. `` Exactly , what ? '' I tell , this being the first thing I had tell out loud. `` That personify the point I was building up to. You make up dying , yes , but I am not replacing you. You are supervene upon yourself. Your choices and needs and wants and experiences are going to move forward through a new biological life , through new eyes , but with the like old ethereal being that has floated through this universe for as long as time has existed. `` I thought about this for a minute , let the concept float through my head , half understanding , and half confused. He stood on the extragalactic nebula line , smiling , eyes filled with a million non-colors , and galaxies spinning gently around us , stars flickering , and comets falling softly. Then I slowly began to realize what he embody truly saying. `` Wait a second , you live n't switching with me , or replacing me. You make up. . . `` `` You , yes. `` He finished my judgment of conviction with a smaller glimmer in his universal eyes. `` Then how issue forth. . . `` `` How come the population rose for a retentive time before plateauing ? Because some of us did n't want to be physical bodies for a retentive time. We were contented with floating through the universe and learning what we could observe , but having a life filled with finality has a way of showing you things you can not learn while being infinite. `` `` How long have I been. . . `` `` Physical ? '' He continued to terminate my sentences as if we were melding into one. `` `` We learned early on that being alive was beautiful. `` TBC", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "I never used to believe in a life after death. I always thought that once you died, that was it. You're just..... gone. But the other day, after being seriously ill for weeks from some mysterious illness the doctors couldn't identify, I died. And I'm still here, in more ways than one. For a while, I was too shocked at being..... dead to accept what had happened. I kept trying to re enter my body, even after watching my own funeral and burial. Eventually I gave up, and sat there in the dark of my coffin, looking at my own corpse. I was dead and it looked like I was staying that way. Except part of me wasn't. Was I a ghost? Did I have some purpose in life that was left unfulfilled when I died? What now? I spent a long time just floating there and thinking. In fact I might still be there if it hadn't happened. It was pitch black, no human could have seen what had happened. But I did. I was looking at my body yet again, when its eyes snapped open. I blinked in surprise, thinking I must be imagining things. But then my corpse raised its arm and slammed it into the coffin lid. I stared. Was I doing this? I wiggled what I thought would be my fingers if I had a physical form, but there was no response from my body. It just kept slamming my arm into the lid of the coffin. At one point I heard a bone snap, and winced despite the lack of pain. What was going on here? Once my body had destroyed the lid of the coffin, a feat which I thought would be impossible for humans, it began clawing its way towards the surface through the earth. It was horrifying to watch, and at that point I felt a cold shiver of fear down my non corporeal spine. If I wasn't controlling the body, what was? What would happen when my reanimated corpse reached the surface? The answer was even more horrific than I had been expecting. It was day time, and as the filthy, dirt caked fingers of my corpse breached the surface, someone saw them. My mother. \"Oh my god,\" she gasped. I can only imagine what she felt in that instant. It had been a week or so since I'd been buried, so there was no way I could possibly be alive. But there were my hands, grasping at daylight. In the end she helped my corpse out, brushing away the dirt and pulling at my wrists. I stood there before her, clumps of dirt caught up in my hair and a faint scent of decay filling the air around me. My mother opened her mouth to say something. Who knows what. My body didn't give her the chance to speak. I was completely powerless as it lunged towards her, mouth wide open. My cries of horror did nothing as it tore into her neck with my own teeth. I tried to get it off her, but my fists went straight through and didn't do a thing. I couldn't even close my eyes, because I didn't have any. I just had to hover there and watch as I murdered my own mother. It's been three weeks since that happened. Three weeks of watching my corpse rampage around slaughtering people. And of course, like any zombie movie will tell you, the people I killed did not die for good. Most of the population has now been infected with the illness that started with me, and my body isn't the only one roaming the streets looking for fresh meat. The rest of my family are safe, fortunately. My father ended up having to shoot my mother, and the look on his face is one I'll never forget. But at least she's free now. I sometimes wonder what happened to her..... soul, spirit, ghost, whatever you want to call it. Did she die when my corpse ripped her throat out? Or did she experience the same as me, following her corpse around until my father shot it in the head? Is she still out there somewhere? If she is, I can't find her. I followed her body around for a while, hoping for a sign that she was still here, but there was nothing. Only more carnage. I watch as my corpse approaches a house. I know there are people in there, I can hear them. I think it can as well. It swings my arms and smashes a window, climbing through despite the jagged shards of glass that tear open my side. I remain outside, not wanting to witness this. I think there are children in there. But instead of screams, I hear a gunshot. A pause, then more shots. My imaginary heart leaps. Did they kill me? I float into the house to see what had happened. My body is wounded, but not dead. Although it is thrashing wildly on the floor, unable to move properly, there is no sign of fear in my glassy, dead eyes. A man stands over it, pointing a gun at it. I stare at him, urging him to shoot. Do it. Do it. DO IT! Without realising, I shout the words out loud. The man jumps slightly. He can't have heard me, can he? But then he tightens his grip on the gun and pulls the trigger.

{"original_text": "\"So..... you're a vampire. And I'm a vampire hunter.\" She sat primly on a boulder across him. The slope beyond led far down towards the dark castle and even from here he could hear the wretched howls of the werebeasts roaming the bone white forests below. \"I believe you've stated the obvious.\" she said. He looked at her, observing her pale skin, wild, dark hair and very red eyes. Her pupils were shattering into the whites of her eyes as the moon loomed closer in the night. \"Why are we having this conversation again?\" She smiled at him, her teeth a row of sharp triangles. \"Because, Ludlow, I enjoy your company in bed and I don't want you to die for no reason.\" \"I'm not going to my death.\" he tried to say, \"I'm an experienced hunter, I'll have you know. This is just me going out to meet your old man and helping him meet his grave.\" he paused, \"Unless..... you're not sentimenal about him, are you?\" She snorted, \"Pull the other one. My concern here is that despite your experience, you're so far beneath his level that he hasn't bothered to open a way up to the castle for you.\" \"Ouch. That hurts my feelings right here.\" he said dryly, \"Don't you think that if he's underestimating me I'll have a higher chance of vanquishing him?\" She shrugged her shoulders.

{"original_text": "My first lucid dream was in my mid-teens. I was laying on a bed, in a room, with an apparatus above my head. I knew this was a dream machine, and wires ran to my head, connecting me to it..... and the person on the other end. I knew it was a girl, in a room fully mirrored, laying in a bed, with the same wires attached to her. When the machine clicked on, there was a slip. Film noir. Following a man in third person. He's wearing a trench coat and a brimmed hat walking down a foggy sidewalk in some 1930s city. He stops at a bar and orders a drink. As the bartendress is making the drink, I realize that I can make stairs out of her hands. As this starts to happen, confusion on her face, she looks at me instead of the character I'm following. Then I feel like I've been punched in the face. My head bounces off the pillow of my bed and I'm awake, full of adrenaline. That's how the dreams were for years after, just your regular weird dream until I assumed control over it and almost immediately crashed it..... until years later. I was a lone warrior in some medieval setting, wandering the country-side. I journeyed into a rather large city and when I entered the front gate I was dumbfounded..... I had been here before! It was something about the shape of the castle's walls, and I could feel the dream start to crash, I was regaining the sense of my body laying in my bed. I stopped my thoughts as quickly as I could by humming a little tune and sauntered into an inn. The feeling of my body had subsided as I had totally forgotten what it was that I was just thinking. As I stepped through the threshold of the building everything became unusually vibrant. The colors and smells didn't have the same dream-like quality as they had had the moment before. This was surreal. As I stepped down out of the entryway onto the dirt floor of the common area I saw her for the first time. I immediately fell in love with her. Something seemed familiar about her. She had a black ponytail, pearly skin, and her eyes looked like emeralds. She squinted at me in recognition and my heart skipped a beat. Before I could realize what had happened everything between her and I blew away in some magical frenzy. The table she was sitting at split a patron in half before blasting through the wall to my right. Silverware and broken pieces of wood slammed into a few other bystanders, and something blew right through the ceiling. I was still staring into her eyes, as lost as a child when I heard her say, \"You...\" That's when the pain of the dagger in my neck registered. I awoke as I bounced clear of my mattress, heart about ready to explode. I stayed up all night. I struggled to remember what that place was, who she was..... WHAT she was. I drew blanks on all three. That night, when I finally HAD to go to sleep, I decided I would just run. As soon as I started dreaming, everything was as clear as it had been in the pub. I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned to look but only saw my own blood leaving my face in a mist in front of an armored fist. I slid down the dirt street of the town briefly before hitting a brick wall and slumped to the ground. I couldn't move, I was searching for my body wondering why I haven't woken up yet. She walked over to me and said, \"You must be out cold!\" I was still searching for my ticket out of the pain in my face when she said, \"I didn't mean in the dream you dumb fuck, MOVE YOURSELF!\" She grabbed me by the arm and twirled round with it so hard that it took me a moment to realize I was flying higher than the tree tops..... without my arm, leaving a scattered stream of blood behind me. Then she was there, flying with me, over the city walls, holding me by my breastplate. When we locked eyes all my pain disappeared until she said, \"Good luck sleeping.\" She then flicked her sword, severing my head from my body. Grabbing my head by my hair, she flung it high and far. Everything spun so fast I only knew that she could've thrown me over the mountains with her strength. I awoke in a sweat, this time with sleep paralysis. After a few minutes of panic, I was able to finally flop my arm right into my face. As my eyes teared up from the smack to my nose, I realized how traumatically real my death had felt in that dream. It was worse than any I had experienced before. Two straight days without sleep, I dozed off on the couch when I was just going to \"lay down for a minute and that's it.\" I was in a dream, tending horses at some farm in the country..... I thought to myself, \"At least she threw me far enough that I can get some actual sleep before she tracks me down and kills me again.\" I spent a whole day working on some farm, trying to think about nothing but what I was doing so nothing would pop me out of some much needed sleep.

The man spoke rapidly as he saw what his opponent was armed with. \"Guns from Deus Ex, Mass Effect, Men in Black, and the low-poly one is from Doom.

An orange sphere flew from the tip, but fizzled out as the man replied. \"Staff of Fire, from D D.\" With a crash and a clatter, the space around Gary was filled with weapons.

As they became more focused, my eyes were able to make out the features around me. Metallic walls enclosed this room, which had almost nothing else in it, save for a door, some bottles and needles, and what looked like a roll of brown parchment right next to me. Almost instantly, the feeling of fear trickled down my body. This did not look anything like my house, the place I was just at with my brother Caleb mere seconds ago - at least, what felt like seconds ago. Minutes, or even hours, could have passed while I was unconscious. The last things I could remember were seeing a red dot on the wall near Caleb, right before knocking him out of the way, thinking he was about to get shot. He usually bragged about dealing with dangerous \" foreigners, \" which led me to anticipate the worst when it came to being with him. Faint memories of me being dragged by somebody, as Caleb escaped through the back door, were the last images I could remember before blacking out. But what about this room? I shot another quick glance at the parchment roll. Curiosity got the best of me as I gingerly rose from the cold metal floor, and slowly grabbed it. The roll felt quite rough to the touch, yet it did not feel as fragile as it had initially looked. Starting from the top, I slowly pried it open to reveal a small photo of Caleb near the bottom of the parchment. It was his DMV photo, surrounded on both sides by what appeared to be writing. The leftmost portion of the parchment was covered with obscure characters, bearing an odd resemblance to the Wingdings fonts you'd normally find on most computers. I did, however, recognize the language on the opposite side as English. To my complete shock, there were only a few words on this side: \" Will kill for autopsy. \" An immense feeling of pressure slammed my chest as I realized what was going on. These foreigners that Caleb was talking about, whoever they were, had gotten ME instead of him. These...psychopaths, were probably looking to kill him and mutilate his body for their sick \" research. \" Yet, they mistook me for my brother, who I was sure got out of the house in time to avoid them.

If I couldn't get out of here alive, convincing my captors that I was their target would be Plan B. Mustering all of my courage, I quietly moved towards the door and turned the doorknob; it was somehow unlocked. To my complete shock, Caleb was standing mere inches from me, albeit with a terrified look on his face. I yelped loudly upon my discovery, yet his facial expression did not budge in the slightest. \" Caleb!! Didn't you escape!?! \" I yelled. \" These..whoever got me is looking to kill you, let's get the fuck out- \" \" I'm sorry, \" he replied in an hoarse voice. As he said this, he raised his left arm and pointed a gun at my face. \" Wha...the...but they want yo-your body for an autopsy? \" I stammered weakly, cowering under the gun's dark, empty barrel. \" They were supposed to shoot you back there. You distracted them. But they wanted me to finish you here, to perform an autopsy on YOU. For their research. The ' foreigners.'No one can see them. Except me.

A few seconds later the explosion launched hundred of small black shards into the air. The men hunkered down , as the area around them was pitter patter by these small projectiles. In the back of the diner , an injured soldier lie down sat propped against the wall. He winced , as the medic polish off the dressing. `` Easy at that place , Jo. The stitches feel a number loose. `` `` Shush , I 'm taste to save the Day '' She said with a wry grin. `` Fuck off. . . . . . Stevens , any word on the air support ?

{"original_text": "Teranthia had been gifting humans power for over a hundred years. No one knew how the planet granted powers to its denizens, or why the era of gifting began when it did, but it caused a great upheaval when it did. Strangely, only those born after the gifting gained powers. At first, the youngest and first to gain powers we worshiped by some and became leaders and weapons of the various nations of the planet. Every year some of the first generation would gain a power. The first decade brought powers like being able to ignite wood or straw instantly, hearing the thoughts of others nearby as voices, being able to float over the ground. These powers never became stronger, but newer, greater magic users appeared. In the second decade, the first mind controllers appeared. Early ones could only manipulate minds, but by the nineteenth year, some could control two minds fully. It became obvious that later years granted more power to abilities, but new infants who gained power were not nearly as powerful as adults who were gaining their powers at the same time. I was born thirty years after the gifting. When I was born, the true users were gaining power. Powers became more ferocious, and the first multi-gifted started appearing. Those who had just obtained their powers were fast becoming stronger than armies, and one day, the culling began. It started with Arnagath. A normal farmer, born a week after the gifting began. When he was forty, he woke one day and became the most powerful man on Teranthia. He was the first triple-gifted, and he had a perfect set. He could lift buildings with his mind, he could seek out the minds of others, see their thoughts, and drive them mad from hundreds of miles away. Lastly, and most terrifying, he had skin like iron. Flaming arrows had bounced of his body, he had had burning tar dropped on him, only to leave him walking naked out from the tar unscathed, driving hundreds of his assailants insane. He took control of our entire country in a week, first breaking the minds of the entire county's leadership, then breaking the walls of the capital. After this show of force, the citizens of the country melted into submission, fearing this new raw power. Everything was peaceful at this point, until a new power wielder challenged Arnagath. A double-gifted who had gained his power a month after Arnagath, he could read minds and mind control others, and move water with his mind. Although Arnagath could move water, this new gifted controlled much better, and could completely shrug off Arnagath's attempts to control the water or his mind. They battled for three days, but his opponent didn't have skin like Arnagath's, and with both exhausted, the newcomer started to suffer from injuries, until he lost his concentration and Arnagath threw a spike into his opponent's heart, finally killing him. Arnagath rested for a day and a half, and then everything changed. Every single man or woman who hadn't gained their power yet who was twenty or old was mentally broken. Both of my parents, in one night, were taken from me. From then on, every census conducted by Arnagath's servants required the identification of a person's power, or were marked as currently ungifted. Those who turned twenty while ungifted were..... taken to Arnagath's palace. I, Lorenzo Catanata had never been gifted, but I knew what killed my parents when I was twelve. I knew that the earlier I gained a power, the safer I was. So, I fled to the nearest orphanage where no one really knew me. When I was asked, I told them I manifested weak telekinesis when I was 6 months old. When they asked me to show them, I tried and tried and ended up breaking down crying. Once when they tried again to get me to show my power, one of the other children with telekinesis actually moved some marbles for me, satisfying the orphanage mother. I left the orphanage when I was 15, but I had a certificate of my power. By then I had learned a small deceptive trick to make small metal marbles dance in my hand, enough to convince most guards and inspectors that my power was authentic. When I turned thirty, a newly gifted fifty-year old appeared. Arnagath held his own briefly, but this new figure had the power to move faster than a blur, and he could steal youth from others. Those were the only powers we knew of. Those who saw the battle saw this new figure, Victor the lifestealer dash around Arnagath, stealing years at a time by hitting Arnagath. After an hour, Arnagath was a wizened old man who could barely move. He died quickly after the fight. This new gifted lord took Arnagath's census programs and cut the age down to 18. Instead of discretely killing him like we believed Arnagath did, he publicly executed them by draining their entire life. Later, other greater gifted would take control of the kingdom, while I waited. I was becoming an old man, waiting for the day I would wield the power to lift mountains or destroy cities with a mere thought. The day finally came. I was an old man of 70, who had already believed that I would die before my power would appear. When I awoke on my 70th birthday, I felt the power. It was so raw, so great.

I mean, it was a normal suburban house, bland color, decent size, scraggly but green lawn, but I had the weirdest feeling I'd been here before. \"Okay.\" Mom shut the car off and looked over at me, flashing a brief, almost nervous smile. \"We ready?\" \"Sure.\" I hopped out of the car, seeing the front door open. Mom had shown me pictures of Alec before (and of course I'd done my own internet stalking), so I recognized the receding blond hairline and the Dad Bod build.

He had a good grip. \"You must be Mikaela.\" I was tempted to comment on his brilliant skills of deduction, but that might not go over so well and I had to spend at least a couple of hours here, so I just said \"Yup, that's me.\" \"Come inside, it's a bit messy right now, I was expecting you a little later.\" He stepped back to let us through the door, and I saw more people waiting inside - Alec's family, Mom had talked about them a little. He had two teenage kids, and Mom really really wanted us to get along. I doubted we'd be instant friends but I was open to the idea, right up until I got a good look at the pair. The younger (or at least shorter) kid was a girl, probably in her early teens, and looking mildly uncomfortable. But as I got a look at the brother I froze.

{"original_text": "It was June 1st, 2015 when they opened the sky above our home. The world remembers the day the Veck invasion started, but for me, it was also the day my daughter was born. As plasma scorched the heavens, my world was changing in a hospital delivery room. I was 39 years old, too old to be drafted, but when the world is at war, the Army can find something for you to do. Four years into the war I was considered an oddity, the casualty rate had been damn near 75, but I had been lucky so far. I had a bit of skill building and repairing networks and it had kept me out of combat. Hell, I even got to Skype my family now and then, they had made it back into the Midwest and were staying with my folks. I was always worried about our daughter Ally though, she never talked, just watched her videos and looked at her picture books. The doctors said it had something to do with the radiation that the Veck's used in their propulsion systems, it was affecting children across the globe. Developmental disorders and birth defects were very common, but one doctor in particular was hopeful as she had escaped the front early on. I was in the basement of what had once been a strip club trying to keep communications up for my regiment when the second wave hit Atlanta. They tore a wormhole open half a mile wide, and soldiers from H. R. Giger's nightmares poured out. The United Nation troops that I was assigned to fought tooth and nail, hand to hand combat in some places when the shock troops poured into the green zone. I was going to die in the heat and humidity of Atlanta 850 miles from where I was born. As they burst through the ground floor windows I could hear the mixed gunfire of my troops, I went about the task of setting the explosives. I was under strict and direct orders to not allow our encryption software to fall into the hands of the enemy. I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn if I was standing inside it, but at least I could do this final task. Sweat poured down my face as I went about my grim final actions and I could hear the unearthly screams of the metal and flesh beasts as they tore apart my friends. The temperature in the storeroom where I had spent the last six months suddenly dropped, I frantically spun around from attaching the last of the cables to the C4 to come face to face with a small teenage girl whose green eyes pierced my soul. At that moment the fortified doors burst open, and half a dozen steel demons burst forth hellbent on destruction. As I stood I grabbed the detonator and whispered, \"God forgive me\" and slammed on button, but nothing happened. The girl looked up to me and in a hauntingly beautiful voice she sang, \"Do you want to build a snowman?\" We had been seen and the beasts were coming for us, I frantically pushed the button again and again, but once again, nothing. The girl turned and for the first time I saw what she was holding, it looked like a flashlight, but when she thumbed the side of it, a very distinctive humming came from and a beam of solid blue light emanated from it. \"Come on let's go and play!\" her melodic voice continued and she leaped into battle. It was a slaughter, she moved faster then I could follow, but before she could finish \"I never see you anymore, come out the door, it's like you've gone away.\" There was nothing but a pile of severed limbs and heads and she was gone out the smashed in doorway. In shock, I looked down and found out why I was still alive, I hadn't connected the last wire. I grabbed my sidearm and rushed up the stairs, they were slick with melting snow. As my vision adjusted to the blinding light, I had a hard time understanding what I was seeing. The Veck were being pushed back, but not by tanks and jets. A serpent dragon that I could have sworn was tattooed on the back of a Japanese soldier I had lost 3 days of desert to a few weeks ago was fighting alongside what could have only been a 12 foot tall and feral form of Winnie the Pooh. Harry Potter and Wolverine were back to back holding off what had to be a dozen Veck. My Little Pony characters were feasting on the flesh of both man and beast like some rainbow colored Mares Of Diomedes. My body and mind decided in unison that they had enough, and I woke up 8 days later in a hospital in Des Moines, Iowa. Within hours of awaking, I was being debriefed by a Brigadier-General and his staff who were very interested in my accounts of what was to be known as the first battle of \"The Children's Crusade.\" After being grilled for 4 hours on my experiences in Atlanta there was a knock on the door, and a nurse whispered \"his family is here.\" I have never seen so much brass move that quickly and they ushered in my wife and daughter. My wife wept and told me how great it was to see me again, even if it was in a hospital and she sat my Ally at the foot of my bed.

Although she had looked over the English teacher's lesson plan quite thoroughly, she decided to review it once more for good measure. She flipped lazily to a middle page, only she passed the lesson plan. On the open page, she found a journal. Day 1: I really like my students! They seem a little nervous, but I can tell they're eager to contribute. Can't wait to journey with them! Day 8: Sandra shared a moving story about her family's struggle to immigrate and settle in. I don't think the others realized the hardship she has faced in her life. I think hearing her story was eye-opening for many of them. Jane seemed especially moved. Day 15: Jessi told me English was her favorite class! Yeah! Day 17: Had to send two students out of class for making fun of another student. I asked Alex to read an excerpt from his reading journal, and as he read, I heard Max and Aaron snicker under their breath. It was infuriating. How could they be so insensitive? It totally disrupts the community and openness we're trying to build. I'm going to have to speak to them before next class. I hate this kind of stuff. Day 17B: Alex came to my office in tears. I told him that would never happen again. I told him that he was doing an excellent job in class and I really appreciated his ideas and participation. I told him to keep it up no matter what, and that I was very proud of him. Day 21: What kind of texts can I use that will appeal my students' interests?

Max gets the main ideas quickly, but sometimes he skips over important details. Sandra worked on her outline slowly and methodically, and I think the way she questioned the text kind of rubbed off on Max today. His outline was more detailed than I've ever seen.

She said she would never forget us and all the things we had learned together. Day 43: Max asked to give a short presentation at the end of class. I told him he was welcome to share anything with us. He shared an original poem (we have been working on several poetry forms). His poem included a farewell to Sandra, how he had never met anyone quite like her, and how he learned from her unique interpretation of the readings when they worked together. The poem expressed the sentiment in all of our hearts. Luisa closed the notebook slowly. She looked at the clock again. 12:57. Time to go to class.

{"original_text": "Sixteen hours..... That's what they said when I left the hospital. That was the time I had left. Initially, I had been upset, but I was beyond that now. It's strange how the human mind seems to deal with tragedy. No, I didn't want to die, but I couldn't do anything about it. And because of that, I'm gon na make the best of every damn second. Luckily, the hospital let me go after only about half an hour, so I had a solid fifteen and a half left. How am I going to tell everyone? Do I even want them to know? I shook my head as I stepped into my car, That wouldn't be fair to them. Closing the door behind me, I placed my hands on the steering wheel, for the first time noticing the softness of the leather beneath my fingers. I stared at the wheel for another few seconds before putting the key into the ignition and pulling out of the spot. The drive home only took fifteen minutes. Funny, I had never been one to focus that much on what time it was. But right now it was exactly 8:45 in the morning. So at midnight, that'd be it. No more me. The thought was almost comical, that my life would be snatched from me so suddenly and at such a specific time. And to think I had left for work this morning just like every other day, and now it was my last day on Earth. I parked the car in the driveway and stepped outside into the bright, warm morning air. It was going to be a hot day today, it seemed. Again, fate seemed to mock me, giving me the perfect weather for the last day of my life. Man, fuck this. I don't want to die, but I also don't want to spend my last day thinking about my situation. Let me just enjoy this last day. And with that mindset, I unlocked the front door and walked into my house. I wish I didn't. I heard..... noises coming from upstairs. I'll spare you the details, but, long story short, my girlfriend was cheating on me. I wonder how long she'd been doing this, waiting for me to leave in the morning just to have some guy come over to replace me. Man, that hurt. So, now I couldn't even spend my last day peacefully in the confines of my own home. Dammit, I'm thinking about it again. I looked around the front hallway. I don't know what I was looking for, maybe answers, but I didn't find them anywhere. I simply grabbed my keys and left. I got back in my car and drove away, trying to forget what I had just heard. I drove over to the park, only five minutes or so from my house. I parked the car and went for a walk around the pond in the middle of the park. I never noticed that the world was so loud, so full of life, and so beautiful. I found a bench looking out over the pond and just sat there. I must have watched a group of ducks paddle around in the water for at least an hour. The little things that I normally would never have taken notice of now seemed like miracles. After some time, God only knows how long I sat on that bench, I got up and started walking. I didn't have a direction in mind, just that I wanted to see everything this little city had to offer. I didn't have enough time to go \"see the world\" or whatever others might have tried in the same situation, but I was determined to at least do what I could to see the world. As I walked, again, the little things in life seemed to jump out at me. The way people walked along the sidewalks, the drumming of a street performer, the different sounds that cars made as they passed me by. These things were all amazing and unique in their own ways, and it pained me to know that I would be unable to experience them past today. A few hours must have passed, because now the sun was high in the sky. The heat of the day finally caught up with me, so I stopped at a street vendor and bought one of those cups filled with little balls of ice cream. I gave the guy a 100, insisting that he take it. I certainly wouldn't need it anymore, and I figured it would be put to much better use in his pocket than in mine. I don't know how, but I ended up on one of the bridges leading out of the city. I stood on the side, looking out over the river as it rolled lazily by. I looked straight down, the height making my head spin a little. I was never one for heights, but today these heights would be my savior. My friends and family wouldn't have to worry about me, they wouldn't even know what happened. A freak suicide, completely unexpected. That's how I would be remembered. Not exactly the legacy I had been hoping to achieve. At this point, though, it was out of my control. I simply didn't want to spend this day agonizing over how I only had a day left to live. My mnind simply wouldn't let it go. No matter how hard I tried to get it to go away, I didn't want to die. I was bitter that I had to die. I was jealous of those that got to live. So I stood up on the railing meant to keep people from falling and I held my arms out wide. I closed my eyes, feeling the warm air wrap around me as the breeze picked up just a little. It was peaceful, in its own way. I stood there for just another moment. Then I took a weightless step, out into oblivion.", "text_perturb": "Sixteen time of day. . . . . That 's what they said when I left the infirmary. That was the time I had leave.

I do n't want to die , but I also do n't want to drop my last day thinking about my situation. Let me just enjoy this concluding day. And with that mindset , I unlock the front door and walked into my house. I wish I suffice n't. I get a line. . . . . noises coming from upstairs. I 'll spare you the contingent , but , long story short , my girlfriend was cheating on me. I wonder how long she 'd been doing this , waiting for me to leave in the morning just to have some guy come over to interchange me. gentlemans gentleman , that hurt. So , now I could n't even spend my last twenty four hours peacefully in the confines of my own home. Dammit , I 'm thinking about it over again. I looked around the front hall. I do n't acknowledge what I was looking for , maybe answers , but I did n't find them anywhere. I simply catch my keys and left. I got back in my car and drove away , trying to block what I had just heard. I drove over to the park , only five minutes or so from my home. I parked the car and lead for a walk around the pond in the middle of the park. I never noticed that the world was so flashy , so full of life , and so beautiful. I found a bench wait out over the pond and just sat there. I must have watched a group of ducks dodder around in the water for at least an hour. The little things that I normally would never have taken notification of now seemed like miracles. After some time , God only knows how long I sat on that bench , I got up and jump walking. I did n't have a direction in mind , just that I wanted to see everything this slight city had to offer. I did n't have enough time to go `` insure the world '' or whatever others might have tried in the same situation , but I was determined to at least do what I could to insure the world. As I walked , over again , the little things in life seemed to jump out at me. The way people walked along the sidewalks , the drumming of a street performer , the different sounds that cars make as they passed me by. These things were all amazing and unique in their own path , and it pained me to know that I would be unable to experience them past today. A few hours must have passed , because now the sun make up high in the sky. The heat of the day last caught up with me , so I stopped at a street vendor and bought one of those cups filled with little balls of ice cream. I gave the cat a 100 , insisting that he take it. I certainly would n't need it anymore , and I figured it would be arrange to much better use in his pocket than in mine. I behave n't know how , but I ended up on one of the bridges leading out of the city. I stood on the side , see out over the river as it rolled lazily by. I looked straight down , the height making my head spin a niggling. I was never one for heights , but today these heights would follow my savior. My friends and family would n't have to worry about me , they would n't even know what materialize. A freak suicide , completely unexpected. That 's how I would follow remembered. Not on the nose the legacy I had been hoping to achieve. At this point , though , it was out of my control condition. I simply did n't want to spend this day agonizing over how I solely had a day left to live. My mnind simply would n't let it go. No matter how hard I tried to get it to pass away away , I did n't want to die. I was bitter that I experience to die. I was jealous of those that got to hold out. So I stood up on the railing meant to keep people from falling and I held my sleeve out wide. I closed my eyes , feeling the ardent air wrap around me as the breeze picked up just a little. It was peaceful , in its ain way. I stood there for barely another moment. and so I took a weightless step , out into oblivion. ", "label": 1}

I hope her therapy session went well today. As I make my way to the front door I think back to the first day I saw her. That swirling cloud of guilt and shame that moved with her even though she had a bright smile on her face. The urge to protect her and help her find a path to happiness almost brought me to my knees. I gave myself up to that love and have never regretted it. I never told her that I could see people's secrets. When she finally opened up to me two years later with that delicate and frail trust of hers I knew it was time to propose. Her dad walked her down the aisle and as I took her hand out of her father's I made a silent vow to her that she would never be harmed again. Not by him, not by anyone. Never would she be made to feel dirty or be touched in any way that she did not invite or want. As I step into the house I feel a welcoming blast of cool air. I swing the door shut with my foot, walking down the hallway filled with photos from our years of marriage and into the kitchen. Bethany's back is to me as she stands at the sliding glass door, looking out into the backyard. I see that familiar dark swirl that is so much a part of her that I rarely take notice of it anymore. Just as I'm about to call out to her I notice the swirl thicken, darken and a new vision appears out of the cloud. What? Oh my g... What? I can't breathe. I can't ... this isn't right. I'm not seeing things correctly. Mistake ... must be a mis... Bethany turns around. She flashes me the kind of smile that hides a fear and is a poor mask for what her eyes show. She quickly moves to the stove to where dinner is cooking. I'm just staring at her. I'm knocked out of my trance when I feel something cold and wet drench my right leg. I look down. I must have dropped the milk and now the plastic jug has busted open. Milk is everywhere. It quickly spans out, filling up the grouted tiled pathways like a river of white trying to make its quick escape to nowhere. My brown shoes are really scuffed up. I should polish them soon. I didn't realize how bad they have gotten. I should be more cautious when walking the concrete steps. The toes of my shoes have taken a beating. Yes, I should polish my shoes. They'll still be scuffed up but I can cover up the marks so they don't appear so obviously worn down. I hear the closet door open and click close. The mop is being pushed back and forth in front of my feet that have rooted to the floor. I look up, she is looking down. I slowly step out of the mess I have made, set my briefcase down on the counter and grab a towel.

I make my way to the sink to wring the towel out where Bethany is doing the same with the mop. My arm accidentally brushes her breast. She freezes, her hand stopping mid-way on the mop handle. I wince. I will never be able to touch my wife again. Still holding the towel, my hands grip the edge of the counter forcing milk back onto the floor. I squeeze my eyes shut. Her therapy, in the beginning, seemed to be helping in so many ways. She seemed lighter, more carefree. We were laughing more; our sex life was verging on the wild and more passionate than ever.

{"original_text": "The wind was rustling my hair and I felt as though I was floating in the sky, everyone thing seemed fine while I was asleep except for the fact that the wind seemed to be rustling my hair too roughly and instead of floating it was though as I was falling off wherever I had laid down. Wait a minute! Where am I? My eyes were still closed and I had my hands tucked behind my head as I try to remember where I was and how I got wherever I was. First I was with John and we just got outfitted with new clothes fit for combat and style and we were just about to jump through the portal to the planet that was causing all the problems on Earth. That's it! I'm on that new planet! But wait, I don't remember entering the portal yet. Hmm..... O shit! Now I remember Alex knocked both of us out, the bastard! He was always like that to us, we couldn't get him back either with him being apart of God and everything. So I should probably open my eyes right now, but it feels so good right now. I sigh as I finally take my hands off of my head and finally open my eyes only to see an empty clear blue sky. He dropped us in the sky?! The fucking sky?! This is gon na hurt I though to myself. I turned to face the earth, seeing a deep green forest, a sea, and a coastline town. Hmm that should be as good a spot as any. I pulled my arms and legs in plummeting even faster to this foreign planet. Alex told us that he had already sent a couple hundred scouts earlier, scattering throughout the planet preparing for our arrival. The people here also seem to have a developed cultures similar to Earth and even spoke some form of English, Alex said it was apparently due to some people from Earth finding and entering portals to this world. Hope I land in a land that speaks English or Chinese I thought to myself as I drew closer to the sea. \"Here's Jonah!\" I bellowed as I broke into the water with a thundering sound. Is it a bit too exaggerated of an entrance? Maybe, but is it any less epic? Hell no. I returned back to the surface with a gasp and a hardy laugh possibly scarring the two men on a small row boat that I had just noticed. They were possibly father and son as both resembled one another and were definitely wet as they were drenched from head to toe still holding on to what looked like fishing poles but were already broken. The father finally spoke \"A-a-are you a g-g-god?\" He was shaking whether that was from the cold or fear was hard to distinguish. \"Uhm no hahaha.\" I lied (about being a mortal) \"I'm just a man, falling from the sky, possibly braking the sound barrier who was just trying to take a nap.\" I gave him my best smile but from the looks of it he probably wouldn't bite the bait (Hahaha see what I did there?) \"Good enough for me pa\" The younger one spoke, he was probably around my age 16 or 15 \"Now let's git ya outa there, ya must be freezin.\" He stretched out his hand. At least there aren't trying to kill me, that's always a good thing, most of the time. I grabbed his hand as I try to get on their fishing boat, his father quickly came to help. \"Thanks\" I said to them while I was looking around, the father seemed to have noticed and asked \"Ya lost sumthin'?\" a small amount of sarcasm and a tiny laugh in the question. I looked into the sky and saw it finally, first only being a small red line in the vast sky it slowly became larger as it got closer (as most things falling from the sky tend to do) The two sharing puzzled glances at one another.

Wait a minute ! Where am I ? My oculus were still closed and I had my hands tucked behind my head as I try to remember where I was and how I got wherever I was. First I was with John and we just got outfitted with unexampled clothes fit for combat and style and we were just about to jump through the portal to the planet that was causing all the problems on Earth. That 's it ! I 'm on that new planet ! But wait , I do n't remember come in the portal yet. Hmm. . . . . O diddly ! Now I remember Alex knocked both of us out , the bastard ! He was always like that to us , we could n't get him back either with him being apart of God and everything. So I should probably open my eyes right now , but it find so good right now. I sigh as I finally take my hands off of my head and finally open my eyes only to see an empty bellied clear blue sky. He dropped us in the sky ? ! The fucking sky ? ! This live gon na hurt I though to myself. I sprain to face the earth , seeing a deep green forest , a sea , and a coastline town. Hmm that should be as skillful a spot as any.

Alex told us that he had already sent a couple hundred sentry earlier , scattering throughout the planet preparing for our arrival. The people hither also seem to have a developed cultures similar to Earth and even spoke some form of English , Alex said it was apparently due to some people from Earth finding and entering portals to this world. Hope I land in a land that utter English or Chinese I thought to myself as I drew closer to the sea. `` Here 's Jonah ! '' I roar as I broke into the water with a thundering sound. Is it a bite too exaggerated of an entrance ? Maybe , but is it any less epic ? Hell no. I deliver back to the surface with a gasp and a hardy laugh possibly scarring the two men on a small row boat that I had just noticed. They were possibly father and son as both resembled one another and were definitely wet as they were drenched from head to toe still holding on to what looked like fishing poles but were already founder. The father at last spoke `` A-a-are you a g-g-god ? '' He was shaking whether that was from the cold or fear was hard to distinguish. `` Uhm no hahaha. `` I lied ( about being a mortal ) `` I 'm just a man , falling from the sky , possibly braking the sound barrier who was just trying to take a catnap. `` I gave him my best smile but from the looks of it he probably would n't seize with teeth the bait ( Hahaha see what I did there ? ) `` Good enough for me pa '' The younger one spoke , he was probably around my age 16 or 15 `` Now let 's git ya outa there , ya must be freezin. `` He stretched out his deal. At least there are n't trying to kill me , that 's always a good thing , most of the clip. I grabbed his hand as I try to get on their fishing gravy holder , his father quickly came to help. `` Thanks '' I said to them while I was looking around , the father seemed to possess noticed and asked `` Ya lost sumthin ' ?

Just roll them around in the flour, and drop them into the oil, and they'll be ready in about five minutes. Now, our main course today is going to be mesquite-smoked salmon rump roast. These things are great, because they grow like 45 legs, and they get that nice hunk of muscle up in the upper leg that tends to be perfectly marbled. We're going to be using an offset smoker to draw the smoke across, and we'll rub it down with a nice mixture of spices. Our side dish is going to be a sauteed quail tail, and the cool thing about these is that when these animals get scared, they shoot the tail at you and then fly away. I mean, who's going to mess with an animal that just chucked its tail at you? Not me. But the cool thing is that means there's an endless supply of quail tail. Have you ever been to the quail tail factory in Texas? It's a lot of fun. They let you scare some of the little guys, and it's hilarious to watch the tails go flying. So we're just going to de-scale these tails and chop them up, and we'll saute them in light oil with some zucchini spears and red potatoes. And there you go, a nice meal for a date, or a weekend dinner at home. I'd recommend serving with a glass of turtle milk.

{"original_text": "\"Charlotte, have you seen the cat?\" I asked down the hallway. We got the cat last week from a shelter and she's still pretty shy. \"No, did you leave the backdoor open for the dogs?\" Shit. I did. Groan. I head out the back calling for Astro, open the gate to the alley, and walk across the wooded lot to the neighbors' house. We've been here almost two years, and are friends with most of the neighbors. But this house, which is a smallish gray Victorian with a wrap-around porch, never seems to have any activity. There are lights on sometimes at night, but I've never seen anyone come or go. It's the last house on the street before the lake, and has a lot more trees around it than the others. Frankly, if I ever thought anything about it, which I can not swear that I ever did, I guess I thought an elderly person lived there who only went out while I was at work. I cross through the little woods calling out and making that little clicking sound people seem to make at cats, as though it does any good. I hear a meow from around the back. At this point, I feel a bit uncomfortable going onto my unknown neighbor's property, but I can't let this cat get lost or Charlotte will kill me. So I head into the backyard. On the porch, sitting on a lounge chair, is a woman. Black hair, blue eyes, a prominent chin, a mouthful of teeth. A white top with a linen shawl and dark fitted pants. Pale bare feet. She cocks her head as I approach and looks at me. What was it about that look? Assessing? Bemused? \"Hi! Hey there. I'm Peter from next door. Have you seen a cat wandering back here? I'm sorry to just barge into your backyard but she's new to the neighborhood and I am worried she will get lost.\" The woman just stares at me and after a moment smiles. She points behind me. I turn and look and there is Astro, just staring at the woman. Astro's back is arched, perfectly still. I walk over and pick her up, she's rigged as a board. I turn back to say thank you and ask the woman's name. She isn't there. She must have walked inside. \"Ok nice to meet you too,\" I grumble. So I found the weird neighbors. Back in my house with Astro, I turn to Charlotte. \"I found the cat. She was at the neighbor's house. There's a weird woman lives there.\" \"Which neighbor?\" \"The one toward the lake. That we haven't met? Odd black-haired woman.\" \"What are you talking about? Across the street, the Morrisons? I think Clair is a blonde. Well a bottle-blonde anyway.\" \"No, on our side, just past the woods. The little gray house with the big porch.\" \"Peter, what are you talking about? There's not a house between us and the lake.\" \"What? Of course there is, I was just there, Astro was in the backyard. I literally just walked over there.\" \"Very funny. Come show me this house.\" Charlotte turned and marched toward the front door. Charlotte and I walked outside. We walked down the street. We walked to the lake, then back. We walked through the woods. Then back. There was no house, there was no yard, no porch, and no black-haired woman. I became pale, confused, and unsteady. Neither of us said a thing for a moment. Charlotte looked at me, somewhat teasing, somewhat concerned. \"You're either messing with me or you're a complete loon.\" She laughed and walked back inside. Neither of us ever mentioned it again. I think Charlotte chalked it up to me being a joker, and probably forgot it ever happened. I think about it often. Either I had an acute delusion, a complete and vivid mental break from reality, or something otherworldly was going on.

{"original_text": "They took my mother from our house, though I cried and begged them not to. The doctors were confused. This was an illness they had never seen before. My mother did not move or speak or even draw a breath, no matter what they did to her. Her skin was pale and cold; her eyes, when they drew the eyelids up, were still and did not respond to light or movement. She had begun to smell, too, a harsh reeking scent that lingered in her sickbed long after she had been taken from it. At the hospital, they treated her poorly. The room they gave her was small and poorly lit, tucked away in a corner of the building. The nurses brought her neither food and water to make her stay more comfortable nor medicine to hasten her recovery. Each day I sat by her side and waited for the healing that was inevitable and yet seemed so far off. Their treatment of my mother made me angrier and angrier and angrier, until at last, one bright morning, I pulled her limp form the bed, sure that I could care for her just as well at home as these fools could here. I wish I had not. When I touched her, her flesh was loose and ripe and sagging. The stench was overwhelming, and only grew stronger as I tried to wrap my arms around her. And- and when- It pains me to form the words. I can not talk about what I saw that day without seeing it once again in my mind. But you deserve to know. When I pulled my mother from the bed, the skin of her face, her eyes, her lips- it split. And within her were worms, white and squirming, making a meal of her flesh. I remember little beyond that; it is all bits of memory and flashes of emotion, blurred together in my mind. I know I screamed and brought the doctors running, and then fought them until they were forced to sedate me. I know that when I was brought to, my mother..... no. Not my mother. What was left of my mother, the thing that sat in the hospital bed- it was gone. They had taken it, to where I do not know. They told me not to speak of what had happened to anyone, on pain of a thousand years' imprisonment. But I must tell you, so that when the time comes you will not be so terrified as I was. I can feel it. There is a heaviness pressing down on me, a stiff sour coldness in my limbs that I have never felt before. When I saw what had happened to my mother- what had become of her- something changed within me. The worm are inside me, too. I can feel them when I sleep, their tiny bodies burrowing phantom holes all through me. I know not how long it will take- days or months or decades- but somebody I will become like my mother, gone somewhere far away with nothing but meat and worms left where I once was. When that time comes, do not wait by my bedside. I do not want you to see what will become of me.

Her skin was pale and stale ; her eyes , when they drew the eyelids up , were still and did not respond to light or movement. She had begun to smell , too , a harsh reeking scent that lingered in her sickbed long after she had been aim from it. At the hospital , they handle her poorly. The elbow room they gave her was small and poorly lit , tucked away in a corner of the building. The nurses brought her neither food and water to make her stay more well to do nor medicine to hasten her recovery. Each day I sat by her side and expect for the healing that was inevitable and yet seemed so far off. Their treatment of my mother made me angrier and angrier and angrier , until at last , one bright morning , I pulled her limp form the seam , sure that I could care for her just as well at home as these fools could here. I bid I had not. When I touched her , her flesh was loose and ripe and sag down. The stench was overwhelming , and entirely grew stronger as I tried to wrap my arms around her. And- and when- It pains me to form the quarrel. I can not talk about what I saw that day without seeing it at one time again in my mind. But you deserve to recognise. When I pulled my mother from the bed , the skin of her face , her optic , her lips- it split. And within her were worms , white and squirming , making a meal of her form. I remember little beyond that ; it is all spot of memory and flashes of emotion , blurred together in my mind. I know I screamed and brought the doctors running , and and so fought them until they were forced to sedate me. I have it away that when I was brought to , my mother. . . . . no. not my mother. What personify left of my mother , the thing that sat in the hospital bed- it personify gone. They had film it , to where I do not know. They differentiate me not to speak of what had happened to anyone , on pain of a thousand years ' imprisonment. But I must tell you , so that when the time comes you will not be so frightened as I was. I give notice feel it. There is a heaviness weightlift down on me , a stiff sour coldness in my limbs that I have never felt before. When I saw what bear happened to my mother- what bear become of her- something changed within me. The worm constitute inside me , too. I can palpate them when I sleep , their tiny bodies burrowing phantom holes all through me. I know not how long it will take- days or months or decades- but somebody I will become like my mother , gone somewhere far by with nothing but meat and worms left where I once was. When that time comes , do non wait by my bedside. I do non want you to see what will become of me. I do not want the worm to burrow their way into you. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "\"Between the midst of the 17th century and the 23rd, humanity entered what is now known as the second Dark Age.\" The voice-over narrated the timeline which stretched from one end of the room to the other, displayed by the holo-teach. It went on. \"At one end of the room, you can see 1492 and the'discovery' of the Americas by Columbus. At the other, on the right side of the room, 2246, the year in which Jalil Balakrishnan first reached Sirius by superluminary travel. The Alcubierre drives back then were horrifically inefficient and required gigatons of hydrogen fuel to be fused to even jump between stars, but for the time, they were a quantum leap in technology over what had existed for the 800 years before.\" I already knew a lot of this. The Second Dark Ages were one of my favourite periods of time, although the third age of war was also intensely interesting. \"So why are these times known as a Dark Age? See for yourself.\" Immediately, the timeline faded and was replaced by several common items of the time. Primitive kinetic firearms were the first to appear, all the way from flintlock pistols used by the sea captains of old, to type-34 heavy bombardment cannons which were utilised in the great wars of 2134. But these were only a small section of the array of objects which were now distributed all over the room, and were labelled under a large sign reading \"WAR.\" Carbon-driven automobiles, horse pulled wagons, Orion class spacecraft - they were all here. The deep, bassy voice of the narrator spoke again. \"From the beginning of recorded history, humans have used fire as a tool. But from the 1600s onwards, the power of the flames was truly harnessed by man - for better, or for worse.\" Factories appeared, and spewed fumes into the room. Although I knew they weren't real, the compulsion to cough still tickled at the back of my throat. \"But soon enough, man was to learn the error of his ways. His greed began to damage the world around him.\" A graph showed at the front of the room, with a curve which bent upwards exponentially. \"Between 1850 and 2055, global temperatures rose by a total of 4 degrees celcius as a result of carbon dioxide and methane pollution in the atmosphere. The notion that such gases would be allowed into the environment is abhorrent to us today, but their effect was not fully understood until the decade of the 1980s, and ignored willfully for years after that.\" \"Of course, this had dire effects on the biosphere. The holocene extinction event wiped out 94 of species on planet Earth, and human population began to fall from a peak of 9 billion in 2029 to a low of 2 billion by 2086. But even this was not the greatest danger. In fact, instead of banding together against the storm of their own making, mankind turned on each other. By 2046 two major geopolitical blocks had developed - one known as \"the West\" and the other \"the East.\" As resources dwindled and famine spread, it was the East who struck first. Tensions rose to a breaking point and it was the invasion of a small rich nation known as \"Korea\" which caused war to break out.\" \"This war, as you should all know, is now called the Third World War. The specifics of the war are both complex and incomplete, as much of the historical data and evidence was destroyed. But it is known that there were two major stages: the conventional war, lasting from 2047 to 2065, in which both sides fought using traditional kinetic weaponry and drone warfare. Over 300 million people died in this stage of the war, and the East took the brunt of the losses - nearly 200 million - leading to a near victory by the West.\" The narrator paused for a moment while maps and battle clips played across the room.

It start on. `` At one end of the room , you dismiss see 1492 and the'discovery ' of the Americas by Columbus. At the other , on the right side of the room , 2246 , the twelvemonth in which Jalil Balakrishnan first reached Sirius by superluminary travel. The Alcubierre drives back then were horrifically inefficient and required gigatons of hydrogen fuel to be fused to even jump between stars , but for the time , they were a quantum leap in engineering over what had existed for the 800 years before. `` I already knew a lot of this. The Second Dark Ages were one of my favourite periods of time , although the third age of war was also intensely occupy. `` So why are these times known as a wickedness Age ? See for yourself. `` Immediately , the timeline faded and was replaced by several usual items of the time. Primitive kinetic firearms were the first to appear , all the way from firelock pistols used by the sea captains of old , to type-34 heavy bombardment cannons which were utilised in the great wars of 2134. But these were only a small section of the array of objects which were now distributed all over the room , and were labelled under a large sign reading `` warfare. `` Carbon-driven automobiles , horse pulled wagons , Orion class ballistic capsule - they were all here. The deep , bassy voice of the narrator spoke once more. `` From the beginning of recorded history , mankind have used fire as a tool. But from the 1600s onwards , the power of the flames was truly harnessed by man - for better , or for speculative. `` Factories appeared , and spewed exhaust into the room. Although I knew they were n't real , the compulsion to cough still tickled at the cover of my throat. `` But soon plenty , man was to learn the error of his ways. His greed get to damage the world around him. `` A graph showed at the forepart of the room , with a curve which bent upwards exponentially. `` Between 1850 and 2055 , global temperatures rose by a total of 4 degrees celcius as a result of carbon dioxide and methane defilement in the atmosphere. The notion that such gases would be allowed into the environment is repugnant to us today , but their effect was not fully understood until the decade of the 1980s , and ignored willfully for years after that. `` `` Of path , this had dire effects on the biosphere. The holocene extinction event wiped out 94 of species on planet Earth , and human population began to fall from a acme of 9 billion in 2029 to a low of 2 billion by 2086. But even this was not the greatest peril. In fact , instead of banding together against the tempest of their own making , mankind turned on each other. By 2046 two major geopolitical blocks had arise - one known as `` the West '' and the other `` the East. `` As resources dwindled and famine spread , it was the orient who struck first. Tensions rose to a breaking point and it was the invasion of a minor rich nation known as `` Korea '' which caused war to break out. `` `` This war , as you should all know , is now called the one third World War. The specifics of the war are both complex and incomplete , as much of the historical data and grounds was destroyed. But it is love that there were two major stages : the conventional war , lasting from 2047 to 2065 , in which both sides fought using traditional kinetic weaponry and drone warfare. Over 300 million people died in this stage of the war , and the East took the brunt of the losses - nearly 200 million - leading to a near triumph by the West. `` The narrator paused for a moment while maps and battle clips played across the elbow room. It showed a long , arduous struggle ; red and blue armies fight against each other across the world while around them , the seas advanced unstoppably. `` By 2065 , the orient had been pushed back and the situation was dire. dearth and revolution were commonplace.

It probably had been a funeral home in the past for all I knew - or perhaps that was all the architect knew how to design. This wasn't exactly the kind of town that nurtured creative talent - our chief exports were abusive alcoholics, infanteers, solo mothers, B-grade rugby players and retired farmers. It was the sort of place that once you left, you rarely admitted to being born there. It wasn't just the pub that hadn't changed, most of the same storefronts were there. The greasy spoon burger place, the ancient department store steeped in nepotism and the faux cultured cafe run by farmer's wives who didn't know a latte from a mochaccino.

At first he looked at me like any of the other locals - an object of both lust and derision - but as recognition dawned, a grin broke out and he slapped the bar in surprise, \"Matthew!\" I winced. That was a name I hadn't heard in person for over a decade. \"Hey,\" I husked, nervously, \"how are you holding up?\" \"Glad you came,\" he replied, serious now, \"I didn't think you'd bother.\" I shrugged, perching on a sticky bar stool and putting my handbag on the equally sticky bar top. \"I thought it was important to see him off. What time is the funeral tomorrow?\" Shaun gestured to the waitress and held up two fingers. She quickly filled two pints for us. \"Midday. The family from up north should be here around ten.\" The waitress paused, smiling at me, \"Oh wow, I love your nails, where did you get them done?\" \"I do them at home, I'm a pretty big nailpolish addict.\" She gave Shaun a sly smile, \"So introduce me to your lady friend, Shaun.\" He blushed, \"Shit Charlene, this ain't my girlfriend, this is Matty, don't you remember him at highschool?\" My stomach lurched as her smile faltered, then fractured. \"Oh,\" she managed, \"you're the tranny brother.\" As she scurried away, I fixed my brother with a disappointed glare, \"Jesus Christ Shaun!

James, secure in the safety of his middle class banality, was employed as a system's analyst for the combined businesses housed in floors 20-33. He lived in a spacious apartment on 40, far above where his parents had raised him. He was headed down to 20 that morning to fix the systems at a bail-bond office. He hated going down to 20. It was a mixed use floor, part commerce, part business, and the highest floor that the \"silters\" from the lower floors were allowed reach. The floor had the feeling of a market on the edge of a slum, with peddlers selling legal and illegal wares with little concern.

The elevator stopped, the doors opened and James stepped out just as the anchors were warning residents about spreading silter unrest in the lowest floors. James, far above the rabble, paid no attention. The smell hit him at once, the intense mixture of openly cooked street food, human sweat, and various perfumes and colognes. The air seemed thicker than usual, and a terse tension hung in the recycled breeze. James fought his way though the midday shopping crowd to reach the bond office, but before he could reach his destination a shrill blast of noise boiled from the PA system. \"ALERT!

All residents of floors 20 and above, please report to your local peace office as soon as possible. Schools, businesses and government offices on floors 1-45 are now closed.\" The crowd on 20 roiled and churned in response to the announcement. James fought his way through the crowd to the up elevator, finding himself in a large group of agitated and confused middle-floorers. There were well equipped guards by the up elevators, checking credentials to make sure no silters were going above their level. James made his way though the crowd, and faced no static from the guards when he handed them his ID and work-order. Stepping into the elevator, James found a place to stand and waited, watching the guards interrogating a shabbily dressed family who seemed very out of place. The patriarch, becoming frantically animated, was shouting and raving. James heard some of what the man was saying, but it made little sense. From what James put together, there was something big and violent happening in the lower floors and people were trying to flee up. James wasn't too worried, he'd lived through at least 3 different attempted coups from the silters, and about 10 years ago a very organized gang had taken over all of the lower levels, until the full might of tower security was brought down on them anyway. Now filled with passengers, the elevator doors began to close. As they did, James heard a shout and saw the family arguing with the guards sprinting for the door. 3 kids made it in before the guards opened fire, bullets flying into and nearly ripping apart the rest of the family, some of the crowd, and a couple of unlucky elevator passengers. The doors closed with a clang, and the elevator began to rise, with the cries of the injured filling the small square space.

{"original_text": "The clinic was a dreary place filled with the palpable atmosphere of mounting dread. It was probably some converted abortion clinic - never intended, really, to be cheerful. Whatever it had once been, it was certainly now a place of endings. The walls were a drab and dingy white, populated here and there with pathetically tasteless hotel art. Besides me, there were several other people in the lobby waiting to have their test administered. My gaze wandered from face to face as I peered over the pages of a badly out-of-date Good Housekeeping that I was doing a terrible job of pretending to read. Everyone seemed despondent. No one wanted to take the test, they just had to. Only the worst was assumed of people who failed to appear for their test. People like that were arrested or shot in short order. There was a couple just a few seats down from me. To alleviate the dread and boredom of waiting for my name to be called, I eavesdropped on their hushed conversation. \" ...I'll love you no matter what. \" \" But what if we don't get the same result? We'll never see each other again. I won't let that happen. I can't let that happen. \" \" Shh... Don't say things like that. You never know who's listening. \" \" I don't care who's listening! I love you and I'm not going to let them separate us. \" \" It's not going to happen. Look, we're both white, we come from good Christian families, we have solid jobs and we've been living together for years. We're gon na get the same result. Let's not jump to conclusions. \" I felt a rising tide of panic - to the point where it was almost a relief when a nurse popped her head into the room and called my name. I plopped my Good Housekeeping back onto the battered table and approached the nurse. \" Uh... yeah... that's me. \" \" This way, \" she said, with zero warmth or preamble. I followed. \" Busy day? \" I asked, mainly out of a nervous compulsion to break the tense silence between us. She gave me a sidelong glance. \" Do you know how many people live in this city? \" \" Not exactly. \" \" Almost 400,000 at the last census. And we have to test all of them. So, yes, we've been very busy. \" \" What about you? Have you been tested? \" \" Clinic staff go last. \" \" Lucky you. \" She just kind of chuckled sardonically, ushering me into a small examination room. \" Step onto the scale. \" She collected a number of preliminary measurements in silence, and finally the moment I'd been dreading arrived. \" I'm going to draw your blood now, \" she said. \" I'll be able to submit the sample right away and we'll have your results within just a few minutes. I'll wait with you until the results arrive. Once they do, I'll be able to advise you on the next steps you'll need to take. Are you ready? \" I felt that I had no real choice in the matter. If I answered no, the best I could hope for was a five-minute reprieve. \" Yes, \" I said, \" as ready as I'll ever be. \" She prepared her needle and I closed my eyes before the point of injection. I hate needles. The pain was sharp and cold and uncomfortable - but it was over before I knew it. She seemed to have a deft hand for this sort of thing. I opened my eyes and glimpsed the blood-filled syringe as she removed the needle and placed it in a bag with my name and social security number on it. \" Just a moment, \" she said, \" I'm going to hand this off to the lab tech and I'll be right back. \" She was only gone for a moment, long enough for me to process that this was all actually happening, and then she was back. She was holding a clipboard and a pencil. \" While your sample is being analyzed, I'm going to ask you some questions to try and help manage your expectations. We find that this greatly helps people adjust to life after receiving their results. \" \" Okay. Ask away. \" \" First, I'd like to ask, what do you know about this test already? I've found it useful to dispel any misunderstandings right at the outset. \" \" Well, I guess it's supposed to be a test to see how good or evil people are. Based on their genes or something. People get assigned new places to live based on their results. \" \" Yes, that's right. Due to prison overcrowding and an overall rise in crime across the world, the Government is undertaking a broad project to dramatically reform the criminal justice system. This test is fundamental to that effort. Based on your results, you will be assigned to a community with all those who share your inherent potential for good or evil. You've probably heard many justifications for this system, but I'd like you to share with me why you think this change is being made. \" \" Honestly? \" \" The more honest you are, the more effective this advising session will be. \" My mind ran over the many reasons to hold back. Not the least of which was my suspicion that this interview was, in fact, the test, and that it ultimately had nothing to do with either my genes or my \" inherent \" disposition toward good or evil. \" I think we're giving up. \" \" Interesting, \" said the nurse, scribbling something on her clipboard. \" Why do you say that? \" \" Because people are so afraid of each other they've forgotten that they can learn from each other. Also, I think the idea that people have some genetic predisposition toward good or evil is completely absurd. \" More scribbling. \" Please, explain. \" \" Good and evil only exist in contrast to one another. We perceive evil only so we can believe ourselves to be good by comparison. And it's pretty well-known that ideas about good and evil differ from culture to culture. Genes don't make a person moral or immoral - society does. \" The nurse nodded her head sympathetically. \" Yes, moral relativism. That's certainly a valid argument that many people make when they come here to be tested. Research has shown, however, that our genes carry the experience of all our ancestors. All their trauma, all their crimes and their kindnesses, encoded in our very bodies. To borrow phrasing from certain Eastern religions, we have discovered a genetic basis for Karma. While you may be right that the nature of wrong-doing is defined by individual cultures, the inclination to engage in wrong-doing transcends the details of any specific act. That is what our test measures. \" \" So, what, the people with the highest score are on the verge of Nirvana? \" \" Not exactly. At least not in medical terms. But they are, generally speaking, more relaxed, mentally healthy, and predisposed toward acts of kindness rather than violence. Unfortunately, studies show that these individuals are often the victims of a variety of crimes that negatively affect their ability to successfully reproduce. We're hoping this program will change that unfortunate reality. \" \" And, by contrast, decrease the odds of a Karmically ' less pure'individual from reproducing. \" \" Well, that may be the case, yes. But the world can no longer afford the politically correct sympathy that has been afforded to such individuals in the past. We simply do not have the resources. \" I sighed. Being honest was getting me nowhere. This nurse probably had some kind of script she was following to respond to every objection. In any event, the Government had all the power. The alternative to taking the test and accepting the consequences of the results was not one I was willing to contemplate. \" That being said, how do you think you'll do on this test? Scores range from one to two-hundred, with one being completely evil and two-hundred being completely good. \" \" I don't know... a hundred? Maybe a ninety or a hundred ten? \" The nurse nodded, scribbling. \" Yes, that's a very normal response. Most people tend to consider themselves very average on this scale. Let me ask you, though, because the results should be back any moment, how would you feel if your score was between one and fifty, somewhere in the evil range? What would a result like that mean for you? \" I wanted to say, \" that the test is wrong, \" but I didn't. For all I knew, I could be carrying around some ugly Karma. I could be evil to my core, constantly sublimating my dark urges in all kinds of ways. I mean, why else would I have such an extensive collection of guitar picks? I don't even play guitar. And there was that one time I laughed at my best friend in sixth grade when he shit his pants in the cafeteria in front of everyone. That was pretty evil. But the test, though, that was definitely evil. Regardless of anything that may have been hidden deep inside my subconscious, the test was evil and I could feel it in my bones. The Government was lying about everything and I knew it. I was going to be the whistle blower on this thing, blow the whole rotten affair wide open. \" I guess, if I got a score that low, it would mean that I'm more evil than I thought, \" I finally decided to say. \" Do a lot of people get results between one and fifty? \" \" It's fairly rare. There seems to be a bell curve in the results. But, that being said, it does happen with some regularity in big city like this. \" \" Well, then, I guess I would find some evil friends, maybe an evil girl to hang around with, it probably wouldn't be that bad. \" \" Hmmm... I haven't quite heard that response yet, \" the nurse said, taking her notes. \" Life isn't exactly easy in those communities. Remember, they have done away with almost all police - and there are no prisons there either. People just do what they do to each other and life goes on. \" \" Well, there's a certain freedom in that, isn't there? \" The nurse looked thoughtful and seemed about to reply when there was a knock on the door. \" I'll get that, \" she said. When she turned back to face me, her eyebrows were raised in astonishment. \" Well! \" she uttered. \" You are full of surprises, aren't you? \" \" What do you mean? What'd I get? \" \" You got a 200! I have to tell you, that is very, very rare. Congratulations! \" There were about 10-minutes of follow-up conversation to which I paid very little attention. My mind was reeling. I left the clinic feeling like I was floating on air, clutching a brochure that I wasn't even aware had been handed to me. As I settled into my car, I knew one thing for sure.

{"original_text": "Dear Death Queen Gnashgara, I write to you to tell you that there will be a slight delay in the next shipment of things to fill your Death Castle with. I know you needed two dozen Paintings of Creepy Staring, but I'm afraid a side project has distracted me, and I have only completed a half dozen. Rest assured, however, that there will be a few extra gifts in the next delivery to compensate, namely an array of butterknives you will find useful in your interrogation sessions. I feel the need to elaborate. You see, after I finished crafting that Sword of Self-Decapitation last month, a few self-righteous adventurers thought it would be wise to try sneaking into my lair and killing a grand enchanter such as I. If I remember correctly, there was a lizard-man who fancied himself a wizard (Ha! I've seen geckos cast fireballs more potent than his), a gnome girl with a bird in tow (I've heard of rangers bringing pets along, but a chicken?

You see , after I finished crafting that Sword of Self-Decapitation last month , a few self-righteous adventurer thought it would be wise to try sneaking into my lair and killing a grand enchanter such as I.

{"original_text": "Day 1 - North America's Patient Zero I woke up with an extremely painful, throbbing sensation in my neck. Initially, I thought it might have been delayed onset muscle soreness from my workout yesterday, but I had never experienced anything to that magnitude before. I examined the area in my mirror and noticed two tiny bite marks - my skin did not look swollen, bruised, or blemished otherwise. Since it is the summer, I usually leave my window wide open. Perhaps an insect - a mosquito or spider - got through the screen. Day 3 The pain hasn't subsided, so I went to my family doctor and had some blood samples taken. She was surprised to see me - I was known to have a superior immune system and ultra-rapid metabolism. I rarely got sick, and on the chance moments when I did, I was usually better before the day finished. Even my recovery from exercising was astounding. Day 5 I'm starting to think it was some kind of spider bite. I've started to lose my appetite. I can still eat, but I just don't feel an urge to anymore. My exercises and workouts don't seem to be affected; in fact, I feel stronger. The pain in my neck has decreased substantially. Day 6 I think I'm having an allergic reaction. I woke up super itchy for some reason. Throughout the day, my entire body would not stop itching. Nothing I tried seemed to work. Day 8 My skin is on fire. I woke up and leaped off of my bed. My roommate ran into my room because I had screamed like someone out of a horror movie - Cassandra thought someone had broken into my room. I spent the day sitting on our couch watching Netflix. Fortunately, my skin stopped being irritated once I left my room. Day 9 I don't know what's happening. I can...smell things. I can smell what Cass had for breakfast. I can smell the flowers hanging from Samantha's window. Samantha is one of our apartment neighbors, we all live on the fifth floor. Her room is on the opposite end of the building. I can smell every ingredient every tenant on our floor is using to cook. I can smell Cassandra. She's...intoxicating. It's not perfume, or lotion, or any cosmetic. It's her actual scent. Her raw, sensual aroma. I know she got her period early. We are usually synchronized, but she got hers a day early. I could smell it. Day 10 I haven't eaten all day. My stomach hasn't rumbled either. The smells of the world can be overwhelming. I learned quickly that if I clear my mind and focus on myself, I can block out the scents. I can also hone in on things - I've been practicing all day. I tried to walk to the gym, but it felt like I was thrown in a vat of acid the moment I stepped outside. I tried again at night, and that worked out perfectly. I think I have a skin condition - perhaps some kind of allergic reaction from whatever bit me? My strength has improved. Immensely. The weights I used to warm up with used to be my one-rep max. I stayed at the gym for nearly three hours and didn't even break a sweat. Day 11 Something has happened to my vision. I can see better in the dark. Better. I can see farther and pick up more detail the darker the conditions. I even tried a pitch black setting - I turned off all the lights in the apartment after Cass fell asleep - and was able to navigate through the flat even more efficiently than during the day. I haven't had anything to eat or drink yet. Day 12 It's the sunlight. I'm fairly certain I've developed an allergy to sunlight. I looked for a thin stretch of light in my room and passed my finger through it. The pain was even more excruciating than the one I experienced in my neck nearly two weeks ago. I nearly screamed when I saw my skin sizzling. Day 13 My doctor called. She said the results of my blood work revealed no abnormalities. Since the pain in my neck was gone, we both agreed that there would be no need for further testing. I didn't mention my allergy. I don't know why. Day 14 I can't stop thinking about Cass. I can't stop thinking about how good she smells. Her scent. Her hair. Her lips. I can smell every and any part of her. I don't feel hungry or thirsty...but..... ...I feel something else. Day 15 With all the weird changes happening to my body I just realized something critical. I haven't gotten my period yet. Day 17 I can't be pregnant - I haven't had sex in a long time. Maybe the stress of everything happening to me has shifted my period over by a few days. Maybe. Day 18 There is something very wrong with me. I don't know what came over me. When Cass left for work, I tore open one of our gourmet steak packages. I threw the absorbent pad into my mouth and sucked all of the juices out. I've never tasted anything so amazing, so perfect. I think I need help. Day 19 I got a new contract today. Fortunately, my job as a programmer - usually website design - allows me to work from home. Cass left to go visit her parents for the weekend. I think my circadian rhythms have finally shifted to match my new sleeping pattern - I sleep through most of the day and stay up all night. Day 21 - The Hunger I need to get out of here. I thought the feeling would go away in a few days, but it hasn't. I can't stop thinking about it. Every fibre of my being is urging me into one direction.

{"original_text": "Chijin hastened his team again. The barricade must be finished by sundown. If it's not, they would all die. The corpses of fallen friends and Devose from before memory would see to that. As he set about binding a pair of tree trunks together with his crew, Chijin glanced at the barrier. The Chosen Elf was twirling his arms in some arcane ritual, beyond the understanding of any non-Chosen. He looked away again. He'd simply have to trust the old man to get it done right. Nearby, the Elven Shiimaas were meditating, ostensibly to hone their minds before battle. Chijin wasn't buying it, but he was willing to let it go. Any one of those Elves was worth his entire company in battle. He'd allow them their laziness. And besides, the sunset was nearly upon them anyway. \"Men of Holtin. We do not owe these people, these dwarves, elves, goblins, and devose anything. On the contrary, they owe us. But we made a promise, and if we aim to collect, we must win this night.\" The men of Holtin stirred and shifted while the man spoke. Chijin thought them all fools. \"So remember why we're out here. Remember your families, your homes, or your gold if that's what matters to you. Muster your courage, and together we will hold this ground until the barrier falls!\" Chijin noticed, out of the corner of his eye, the Chosen had stopped his arm waving and was consulting with Gfendol. Neither looked pleased. He resolved to get in on the conversation. \"Soli, this barrier must fall!\" Gfendol was visibly shaking. \"Fen, it's too powerful. Even with blood sacrifices I could not breach it.\" The old Elf was drained, and it showed. His color was ghostly, and he was hunched over as if he was bearing a great weight. \"If thisss barrier can not fall...\" Chijin was loathe to continue, and instead trailed off. Failure meant death at this point. There was no other option. \"If it claims us, so be it. But keep trying, Soli. This is what you're here for.\" Chijin cocked his head, and listened. A moment before, he'd heard something. A moment later, all hell broke loose. Out of the surrounding woods, corpses came pouring out, intent on the make-shift barricade. All together, the Shiimaas rose, their armor assembling on them as they ran to the front.

It has no taste to it. It has no gravity. It doesn't awaken our senses. It doesn't enliven our joy. And we've gotten so used to it, we expect it.

I think everyone remembers his or her first. For me, her name was Mary; she was a family friend. She was twenty-three years old with alabaster skin that stood taut beneath my teeth. She smelt of pine and the Sierras. She tasted of it. If I close my eyes, I can just draw the ghost of her onto my tongue, and it proves to me what we are all missing now.

While some may see this cooler full of blood and think it only the crude viscera of the deceased, I see it is a library, full of wonders ready to be explored. For example, this, this beauty was Nathanael. He was a software engineer with a Masters in French Literature. He composed poetry and would spend hours every week riding his bicycle. He had a pet bulldog named Napoleonette that he would share his meals with. I would like to add that I found Napoleonette a home after dear Nathanael was humanely slaughtered. I am attentive to these compassionate details, and I think it shows. There is something distinct when one processes blood humanely. The blood is lighter and brighter for it. Here, I will show you. Have a taste, but smell first. You can almost taste the salt of his sweat, see the words and numbers that flowed through his veins. It's pungent and forthright, is it not? It's a strong flavor, to be sure, but single origin blood is known for its unique flavor profile. It fills the palate more, and gives a greater feeling of satiety. Such is the boon of quality that makes up for quantity, which I believe my price points reflect.

However, no humans were killed. Instead, donations were taken while they slept and under a natural analgesic, unaware that anyone was at their bedsides. It takes time to retrieve quarts this way, but you'll notice the difference immediately. This flavor profile is far worth the effort and premium. Here, might I introduce you to Vanessa? She is a ballet dancer, just sixteen. One sip, and you can taste the music. You can feel Tchaikovsky thrumming across your tongue. Can you see her, twirling en pointe, that bright spark of fire? She is a virgin, as you might notice. She has such a clear, clean high bouquet, with bright, lively undertones. They pirouette and pas de bourree across the palate. And all of this without affecting Miss Vanessa's dancing career. Remarkable, no? You can take Vanessa with you, and if you come back in a few months, I'll have more of Vanessa to provide.

{"original_text": "30 years in this business, and I've had enough. I've ended thousands of lives in that span. Some have deserved their fate, some probably haven't, and three were accidents, my only ones. Those three wake me in the middle of the night. I remember each of their faces vividly. I relive their deaths daily. And one man is responsible for all three of them. The first time I was hired to kill Matthew Cauthon, I had only been in the game for a year and a half. Hell, I had only \"left\" the military two years prior. I must have been 24 at the time. A prominent Atlantic City casino owner had hired me to put Cauthon down after he had turned a hundred dollars into a hundred and fifty grand over the course of 6 hours, while simultaneously wooing the casino owner's daughter. He had then supposedly \" kidnapped \" the daughter and taken her to somewhere in Central America. I found them at a small resort in Costa Rica, and booked a trip for myself. I figured I'd be in and out within 48 hours maximum, but the shortest available resort stay was four days so I decided to take my time with it and be really careful. The first two days I just observed Matt and the daughter trying to discover habits and patterns. I was specifically looking for times where Cauthon would be alone: the casino owner had been adamant about his daughter ending up oblivious to Cauthon's death. He was supposed to just \" disappear \" so that the casino owner could use it as a lesson to her daughter about \" men like that .\" It was a pleasant enough time. In fact, it felt like a vacation for me really. All this girl and Matt did all day was drink, smoke weed, eat, and gamble. God did Matt like to gamble. He would constantly play the slot machines in the bar, which he seemed to consistently do well on. There were poker games held in the rec center by the pool after dinner. About 20 of us would show up and play down to a winner. Matt got second on the first night and won on the second night. He even got a hold of some dice at one point and managed to get a small game going in the bar, which he of course won. I should've taken these occurrences as the warning signs they were. I planned to make Matt disappear on his walk back to his room after the poker game on the third night. The previous two nights, Matt had done quite well and the daughter had done quite terribly. Having played a bit of poker over the years myself and observed both of their respective games, I knew these consistent results for the two of them were no coincidence, and on the previous two nights the daughter had gone back to the room for a nap until Matt showed up. This was the only time Matt would be outside alone at night. It was a good plan, and even if it didn't work out, I had at least one more opportunity the following night. Sure enough, the daughter was the fourth person out of the poker game. She hung around watching Matt and cheering him on for maybe an hour, but then decided she needed a nap and retired. Luckily for me, I was performing decently in the game as well, so I had an excuse to remain until Matt took off. If he busted before I did, I planned to excuse myself to the washroom. As luck would have it, Matt and I ended up as the final two players of the evening. Once we reached that point, I suggested we split the rest of the winnings evenly and just call it a night. At first, Matt was very hesitant. He wanted to play it out, saying he was the better player and all that. I knew how to play this one. I told him he was indeed the better player, and that I had been asking in order to try to swindle him. I countered by offering to give him 55 percent of the winnings instead. He thought for a moment, then said 60 percent. I said I was tired anyway and agreed. We shook hands and took the money. We started walking back towards our rooms. Mine was relatively close to Matt's, so it didn't look suspicious. I had my garote in my right pocket, planning to feign lighting a cigarette about half way towards the shacks, and then jumping him from behind. There was some thicker vegetation off to the right about half way back, so I had some decent cover for the deed once I had begun. Just in case, I had a silenced 9mm stashed just along the path. As we got nearer to the bushes, I started preparing. I pulled a cigarette out of my pack and grabbed my lighter while maintaining my stride. I started trying to light the thing, pretending like the wind was causing my issues. I stopped and turned away from Matt. He kept blabbing on about whatever it was he was explaining to me about cards. I dropped my smoke and lighter while pulling the garote out of my pocket and turning to start back towards Matt. I took quick but quiet steps. One..... two....lifting my arms...... \" What the fuck man? \" he said as he started turning towards me, \" can't you light that goddamn cigar...... \" He cut off mid-sentence as he saw me coming towards him with the wire. He reacted immediately, ducking low and throwing his shoulder into my my gut and chest. I doubled over immediately, but still attempted to get the garote around him somehow. I managed to get it around his chin and just started to pull as hard as I could. He yelled out in pain and then started elbowing my in the ribs. The pain was blinding: he must have cracked one of them in his initial strike. I doubled over again, losing my grip on the garote and Matt. He jumped up and kicked me in the ribs again for good measure, then started sprinting towards his room. I pulled myself together quickly and started looking for my gun. I had made it's location very easy to find without it being too obvious just in case stuff like this happened. I located it after about 5 seconds and started after Matt. He was fast though, and I had cracked ribs. Thank god for adrenaline. I was about 40 meters behind Matt. Christ he was fast. By the time he cleared the brush surrounding the path, I had lost even more ground. He was close to the patio door of his room now. I could see the light was off. \" Stacy!!! \" he screamed. \" STACY OPEN THE DOOR!! \" I made it to the edge of the brush. I readied my pistol. It had to be now. I wouldn't get another shot at this. Please god let Stacy be asleep. \" STACY OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!!! \" I aimed and started to squeeze slowly. This was it, I had him. I fired. Matt tripped over the slight step up onto the patio and slammed into the concrete in front of him. Fuck I had missed. Matt gathered himself and looked up towards the glass door. I readied myself for another shot, then caught a glimpse of what Matt was looking at. There was Stacy, in the door way. The bullet hole in the glass was right at her chest height. She stood for a moment with the most confused expression on her face, then fell backwards. \" STACY!!!! \" Matt screamed, jumping up. Lights started appearing in other rooms along the line of shacks.

I live over their deaths daily. And one human beings is responsible for all three of them. The first time I was hire to kill Matthew Cauthon , I had only been in the game for a year and a half. Hell , I have got only `` left '' the military two years prior. I must ingest been 24 at the time. A prominent Atlantic City casino owner had hired me to put Cauthon down after he had move around a hundred dollars into a hundred and fifty grand over the course of 6 hours , while simultaneously wooing the casino owner 's daughter. He had then purportedly `` kidnapped `` the daughter and taken her to somewhere in Central America. I found them at a belittled resort in Costa Rica , and booked a trip for myself. I figured I 'd cost in and out within 48 hours maximum , but the shortest available resort stay was four days so I decided to take my time with it and cost really careful. The first two days I just note Matt and the daughter trying to discover habits and patterns. I was specifically looking for times where Cauthon would be alone : the casino owner had been adamant about his girl ending up oblivious to Cauthon 's death. He was supposed to just `` disappear `` so that the casino owner could practice it as a lesson to her daughter about `` men like that. `` It was a pleasant enough time. In fact , it felt like a vacation for me in truth. All this girl and Matt did all day was drink , fume weed , eat , and gamble. God cause Matt like to gamble. He would constantly play the slot machines in the bar , which he seemed to consistently manage well on. There were poker games held in the rec center by the pool after dinner party. About 20 of us would show up and play down to a victor. Matt got second on the first dark and won on the second dark. He even got a hold of some dice at one point and managed to get a small game going in the taproom , which he of course won. I should 've taken these occurrences as the warning signaling they were. I planned to fix Matt disappear on his walk back to his room after the poker game on the third night. The previous two nights , Matt have got done quite well and the daughter have got done quite terribly. Having played a bit of poker over the years myself and observed both of their respective games , I screw these consistent results for the two of them were no coincidence , and on the previous two nights the daughter had gone back to the room for a nap until Matt showed up. This represent the only time Matt would be outside alone at night. It was a good plan , and even if it did n't work out , I accept at least one more opportunity the following night. Sure enough , the daughter was the fourth someone out of the poker game. She flow around watching Matt and cheering him on for maybe an hour , but then decided she needed a nap and retired. Luckily for me , I was performing decently in the game as well , so I had an excuse to remain until Matt take on off. If he busted before I did , I planned to explain myself to the washroom. As luck would have it , Matt and I ended upwardly as the final two players of the evening. erst we reached that point , I suggested we split the rest of the winnings evenly and just call it a night. At first , Matt was very hesitating. He wanted to play it out , saying he was the better actor and all that. I knew how to play this one. I told him he was indeed the better player , and that I had been need in order to try to swindle him. I countered by offering to sacrifice him 55 percent of the winnings instead. He consider for a moment , then said 60 percent. I say I was tired anyway and agreed. We shook hands and took the money. We started walking back towards our way. mine was relatively close to Matt 's , so it did n't look suspicious. I had my garote in my right pocket , planning to feign lighting a cigarette about half way towards the shacks , and then stick out him from behind. There was some thicker vegetation off to the right about half way back , so I had some decent cover for the deed erst I had begun. Just in fount , I had a silenced 9mm stashed just along the path. As we got closer to the bushes , I started preparing. I pulled a cigarette out of my pack and grabbed my lighter while maintaining my tread. I started trying to light the thing , pretending like the wind was causing my result. I stopped and turned off from Matt. He kept blabbing on about whatever it was he was explaining to me about circuit board. I dropped my pot and lighter while pulling the garote out of my pocket and turning to start back towards Matt. I ingest quick but quiet steps. One. . . . . two. . . . lifting my subdivision. . . . . . `` What the fuck man ? `` he said as he started turning towards me , `` ca n't you promiscuous that goddamn cigar. . . . . . `` He cut off mid-sentence as he saw me coming towards him with the telegram. He reacted immediately , ducking low and throwing his shoulder joint into my my gut and chest. I doubled over immediately , but still assay to get the garote around him somehow. I managed to get it around his chin and just started to pull every bit hard as I could. He yelled out in pain in the ass and then started elbowing my in the ribs. The pain was blinding : he must have cracked one of them in his initial bang. I doubled oer again , losing my grip on the garote and Matt. He jumped up and kicked me in the ribs again for full measure , then started sprinting towards his room. I pulled myself together quickly and started face for my gun. I had made it 's location very easy to find without it being also obvious just in case stuff like this happened. I located it after about 5 seconds and bulge out after Matt. He make up fast though , and I had cracked ribs. Thank god for adrenaline. I make up about 40 meters behind Matt. jesus of nazareth he was fast. By the metre he cleared the brush surrounding the path , I had lost even more ground. He was tight to the patio door of his room now. I could see the light was off. `` Stacy ! ! ! `` he squall. `` STACY OPEN THE doorway ! ! `` I made it to the edge of the brush. I readied my shooting iron. It had to represent now. I would n't get another shot at this. Please god let Stacy be asleep. `` STACY OPEN THE FUCKING room access ! ! ! `` I aimed and started to squeeze slowly. This follow it , I had him. I displace. Matt tripped over the slight step up onto the patio and slammed into the concrete in battlefront of him. Fuck I had lack. Matt gathered himself and looked up towards the glass room access. I readied myself for another shot , then captivate a glimpse of what Matt was looking at. There was Stacy , in the doorway way. The bullet hole in the glass was right at her pectus height. She stood for a moment with the most bewildered expression on her face , then fell backwards. `` STACY ! ! ! ! `` Matt screamed , leap up. Lights started appearing in other rooms along the line of hut. It constitute time for me to leave. Part . . . . ummm , sometime ? tomorrow hopefully. Sorry for any grammar and spelling shit.

{"original_text": "THE BEGINNING OF THE BEGINNING Gods don't have names. Hell they don't even have faces, hands, feet or any of the other lovely things that they are always depicted as having. So we, dear readers, will have to bend our imaginations just the slightest bit as we continue reading, because otherwise this would have all the makings of a rather boring story, now wouldn't it. One sat in the middle of the sickle-moon table, on the outside edge of course. He was called One not because he had been the first God, but because he was the first player. What kind of an idiot God would name themselves after a number. Two sat on his right. Three sat on his left. One turned to two. Now that the first customary hour of silence had passed on the Clock of Totally Linear Time, One turned to Two. \"Are you sure you want to play another game of Planetary Shenanigans, Two?\" \"Why yes I am, One\" said Two. Three nodded, indicating that he would also like to play, and scored himself a few extra points for being the last to break the silence. \"It's still raining diamonds in the second half of the solar system, and we played that game over five hundred years ago.\" One said. Three laughed, losing the points he had earned to One, but he didn't care. That diamond rain had been the funniest thing to happen since the monkeys had learned how to play with fire. Two shuffled and cut the deck. One cut the deck. Three cut the deck. Now that the deck had been conveniently sliced into eight tiny decks, the game could begin. One pulled out the Pack of Interplanetary Decision cards, and dealt one to each member. \"Venus\" said Two. \"Mars\" said One. \" \" Mercury\" said Three. One had to double his points and give them to Two. Three could then take any number of points from Two that he pleased. He took none. Each god took one of the tiny packs, stretching them until they were at least normal size. The game started. Three placed two cards facedown. Two followed with five cards. One placed a single card. \"Shenanigans!\" said Three. One flipped the last five cards. Royal Flush. \"Oh come on!\" said Three. Now he had to roll the Infinitely Sided Dice of Limited Possibilities. One took half the points from Two, which he doubled and doubled again. Three rolled the dice. \"Lucky\" said Three, staring at the result. Mercury suddenly had it's rotational speed increased, allowing Three to score a few points again. One opened, placing twelve cards, blind, down on the table. Two waved his hand, indicating a pass. Three dropped another five and said \"Call it.\" One sacrifced points to Three so that he didn't have to. Now they had to draw a new card from the Pack of Interplanetary Decision cards. \"Neptune\" said Three. \"Pluto\" said Two. This resulted in Two taking a point-penalty, as Pluto was rather uncertain about it's own planetary status, which affected it emotionally. One stared at the card he had flipped. \"Alright you jokers, who put Earth in the pack?\" Both of them had faces chisled from the finest venitian marble.

{"original_text": "\"How come you' so young looking?\" asked Andra. We were enjoying a rare outdoor lunch where we could see the mountains behind the razor wire. Andra gazed up at the clouds with his head back. \"It just might be that I look young, because I am young,\" I replied. But the question stirred in me with unexpected potency. \"Your at least 40. That's no so old. But you don't look it. Not a gray hair on you. And you still eat like a hog.\" He pointed at the single bit left of my bologna sandwich. His was opposite of mine, only one bite taken. \"If I don't look it, how are you so sure I'm 40.\" \"You and I came the same week. You remember that. Twenty-five years ago now. You weren't fifteen then. I would guess maybe thirty. We were both lifers come on the same week. I was only 28 then. Thought you was older than me. But now. I feel like I could be your papa.\" \"Guess I'm lucky.\" \"I'm guessing' there more to it than that.\" \"Like what?\" \"I don't know what but something'. Let's just leave it there.\" Sargent Edwane looked at me through the glass, giving me the glare the one that sometimes sent men to isolation. Andra swore the glare burned him once, gave him the scar on his chest. \"This paper here says you're fifty-five,\" stated Edwane. I kept my eyes in my hands; it wasn't a question. And even if it was I didn't have the answers he was looking for. Most mates called me Tut. They joked about how neither of us got old. Him, they said, cause he died; me, they said, cause I didn't know how. \"This paper here says you are fifty-five.\" Edwane repeated. I could hear in his voice he wanted to do me in. I figured I better respond. \"Yes sir.\" I offered. \"Now look here young man. We both know you ain't that old. How did you get in here? Where is the original Den Alled.\" Edwane was standing now, pointed at me the paper as though it was his pistol. There was a hint of red creeping into his face from the roots of his blond hair. \"I don't know what you mean sir. I'm Den.\" I knew it was the wrong thing to say. But it was the truth. I spent the next week alone; except when the doctors came. \"Some people think the president should give you a pardon,\" said the reporter. \"What do you think of that?\" It was nice to be talking to someone from the outside other than a doctor without a glass between us. \"I'd like to get out,\" I said. \"But so would a lot of the other folk here.\" As I talked I gulped down the hamburger he brought me. Perhaps if I finished it, he buy me another. \"You've been here for fifty-three years, yet the doctors still say your body is like it was when you arrived at the age of twenty-seven. Do you think you make it another 247 years to finish your time?\" \"Look,\" I said. \"I have no idea what is going on with my body. Plenty of people have asked me for the'secret.' There is no secret. This is just the way I am. I'd like to free, but 247 years is a long time. I've got more hope the president will pardon me; but why should he? We both know I pleaded guilty. I did terrible things. It took me a while to see it, but I understand it now. This is where I belong. Were I can't do something like I did before.\" Burr was a hot head. Got thrown in with us after his wife finally got the courage to go to the police. I'd seen his type before, knew I'd have to show him his place before he'd leave me alone. I missed Andra. That guy knew how to do this kind a thing without hurting' anyone. So when Burr took one of my pancakes when a guard wasn't looking'. I gave him a swift punch in the gut. He exploded in a ball of fury showering me with infective punches, I easily deflected with my forearms. After a man fights much he learns to deal with the pain of being hit. Burr's little punches never could have phased me. But they didn't pain me at all. I could feel the force of them, but they had absolutely no effect. There were no bruises to heal from. Later in isolation I pressed my knuckles against the cold raw wall and felt the same thing. It isn't much, but a cold raw wall scrapes a little. So I closed my fist and gave the wall a good pat. No pain. I hit harder. Nothing. I haven't felt a bit of pain since then. Round midnight I was looking at the bright lights on the perimeter through the narrow window in my cell. I'd read a lot of books in the fifty years since they put me in this place. There was fiction, and there was non-fiction. I was beginning to feel more like fiction. Doctors still wanted to see me from time to time, but it was always the same. They didn't know what to think of me. Nothing in my genes. Blood was normal. Memory was normal. Eyesight was good, but just normal good. I was just a normal twenty-five year old fool who had been that way for decades. Who am I? What am I? Most doors around here open when a guard pushes a button, but some of them have handles. They were having a class on poetry which I'd found to be more enjoyable than nothing. The door to the hall was electric, but the classroom door, that one, it had a handle. Like a fool, I pulled when the door needed pushing. The handle came out of the door. Splinters from the wood jumped all over the room. The knob in my hand conformed itself to shape of my hand. I didn't mean any trouble. Guess I'm a little stronger than I realized. The guards went nuts. They tried to get me to lie on the ground, but I just ignored their metal sticks and tasers. One of the fellows got a cuff around one of my hands, but it must have been defective: it broke when I pulled on it. By this time there were more sirens and guards than I'd ever seen before. They hauled everyone else away including the poetry teacher. They shouted at me with a megaphone, but I just didn't care anymore. After twenty or so of them got tired of wrestling with me, they finally game me some distance. I tried not to hurt any of them, but it is hard to get out of a pile of twenty men without pushing and shoving. I went back to my cell. No one would push the buttons to open the doors for me, so I broke them all. Its not my fault they don't have handles. Anyway, I'm tired. I hope they let me get some sleep.", "text_perturb": "`` How come you ' thus young looking ? '' asked Andra.

Were I ca n't serve something like I did before. `` Burr make up a hot head. Got cast off in with us after his wife finally got the courage to go to the police. I 'd seen his type before , knew I 'd have to show him his office before he 'd leave me alone. I missed Andra. That guy make out how to do this kind a thing without hurting ' anyone. So when Burr pack one of my pancakes when a guard was n't looking '. I gave him a jonathan swift punch in the gut. He explode in a ball of fury showering me with infective punches , I easily deflected with my forearms. After a man fights much he read to deal with the pain of being hit. Burr 's little puncher never could have phased me. But they did n't ail me at all. I could sense the force of them , but they had absolutely no effect. There personify no bruises to heal from. later on in isolation I pressed my knuckles against the cold raw wall and felt the same thing. It is n't much , but a cold raw wall scrapes a petty. So I closed my fist and commit the wall a good pat. No pain sensation. I hit harder. nada. I have n't mat up a bit of pain since then. Round midnight I follow looking at the bright lights on the perimeter through the narrow window in my cell. I 'd read a lot of books in the fifty years since they position me in this place. There was fiction , and there was non-fiction. I comprise beginning to feel more like fiction. Doctors still wanted to see me from clock time to clock time , but it was always the same. They did n't know what to think of me. aught in my genes. parentage was normal. retentivity was normal. Eyesight was practiced , but just normal practiced. I was just a normal twenty five year old fool who had been that way for decades. Who am I ? What am I ? Most doors around here open when a guard pushes a button , but some of them have hold. They were possess a class on poetry which I 'd found to be more enjoyable than nothing. The doorway to the hall was electric , but the classroom doorway , that one , it had a handle. Like a fool , I pulled when the door demand pushing. The handle came out of the threshold. Splinters from the wood jumped all over the elbow room. The knob in my hand conformed itself to determine of my hand. I did n't mean any fuss. Guess I 'm a little strong than I realized. The guards went ballock. They tried to get me to lie on the ground , but I only ignored their metal sticks and tasers. One of the fellows got a cuff around one of my hands , but it must have been faulty : it broke when I pulled on it. By this time there exist more sirens and guards than I 'd ever seen before. They hauled everyone else away include the poetry teacher. They shouted at me with a megaphone , but I just come n't care anymore. After twenty or so of them got tired of wriggle with me , they finally game me some distance. I try not to hurt any of them , but it is hard to get out of a pile of twenty men without pushing and shoving. I pass away back to my cell. No one would push the release to open the doors for me , so I broke them all. Its not my fault they arrange n't have handles. Anyway , I 'm tired. I hope they let me get some nap. ", "label": 1}

There aren't any surprises. I was put in here by a judge and jury a few weeks back. I had seen a homeless man on the ground and he appeared to be shivering. When I got a little bit closer, I saw that he was actually bleeding. He had a laceration in his stomach and was bleeding pretty bad. He was moaning and wailing. I took off my overcoat and wrapped it around him and asked him to try to remain calm and that everything will be alright. I stopped the bleeding by taking off my scarf and applying pressure on the wound. I yelled for help and by the time the police got there with paramedics, the homeless man was unconscious. He still had a pulse, but it was fading. I told the police what happened and they instantly threw me into a police car. I was arrested for attempted murder because they said there was no plausible reason for a total stranger to help a bum. They said I sounded insane when I wanted to help my fellow man and that I thought he could have survived. The trial showed the public that I slashed this man and tried to kill him, that the homeless man was the one calling for help, that I was only trying to smother the wound because I was trying to rip it open further and my scarf got in the way, and that he was wearing my overcoat so nobody would see a dead body, only a bum wrapped in a coat that he probably stole in order to keep warm on a cold December Monday. During the trial, I was found not guilty by reason of insanity. The judge ordered me to be sent to an asylum and take prescription medication to level myself out, although he has no faith in modern science and thinks that all pills are sugar pills to induce a placebo effect, an effect that unfortunately, according to him, was not sufficiently backed by scientific research.

{"original_text": "The Illusive Man appeared on the hologram one final time before Commander Shepard. \"Shepard, I'm telling you, we can control the Reapers! Are you willing to pass up the opportunity to control the most powerful beings in the universe? Imagine what we could learn! What we could do with it! Humanity could rule this galaxy with an iron fist!\" \"And what if you're wrong? What if there is no way to control the Reapers? What if they've been indoctrinating you this entire time and you haven't even realized it?\" Shepard asked rebelliously. \"What if? There is no what-if! We know it will work! We've tested this in labs hundreds of times \"At the cost of how many lives?\" \"That's unimportant right now. What I do know is that the results point to my hypothesis being correct: there is a way to control them.\" \"Do you want me to tell you something I learned on Thessia in my search for the Crucible? I found a VI constructed by the Protheans; you should know about that. After all, your men stole it from me. But before you did, that Virtual Intelligence told me that during the last extinction cycle, there was a splinter group of Protheans that thought there was a way of controlling the Reapers.\" \"What are you saying Shepard?\" \"They were indoctrinated. The Protheans discovered that the rebels were indoctrinated. Illusive Man, you're indoctrinated, no doubt in my mind. But you can fight this. You may be one of the most evil, sociopathic people I know, but I also know that you're one of the most thick-headed, stubborn people I know. And above that, you know that the Reapers would try to do something like this. You're smart, you know that this is exactly something the Reapers would do. But what you didn't think was that you'd be the one it happened to. Well guess what? You're wrong.\" With that, the Illusive Man looked dumbfounded in disbelief. He couldn't believe that himself, of all people, could be indoctrinated. It never even crossed his mind until Shepard suggested such a possibility. \"I-I..... Dammit Shepard, I think you're right. What can I do about it? I think it's overpowered me already. What if it's too late to reverse the effects?\" \"I'm not giving up on you that easily. Maybe it's not too late. You're in control of your thoughts right now aren't you? They clearly haven't gotten all of you. Is there any Reaper technology near you? Around you?\" \"Are you kidding me? I'm cybernetically enhanced with Reaper technology.\" \"WHAT? You know Illusive Man, you're making this really difficult. I don't know what to do about this. Here's an idea: I'll send a team of researchers to your base to take you in and see if they can reverse the effects of the cybernetics. If it works and you're still you, we can work together to stop the Reapers. If it doesn't..... I'm sorry.\" \"I don't like it, but I'd rather be on your side than the Reapers. Shepard, I don't like you and I certainly don't agree with you, but right now you're humanity's best hope to survive this apocalypse. I may be stubborn, but I'm not an idiot. Send a ship, I'll go peacefully.\" \"That's a relief. Shepard out.\" With that, Shepard shut off the hologram and walked out of the war room. Did he just do what he thought he did? The Illusive Man was one of the most powerful humans in the galaxy, and a former ally of Shepard's, and now he submitted peacefully to Shepard. As he walked past the control map towards the elevator, he thought of his history with the Illusive Man. Just 6 months prior he as being employed by him to help stop the Collectors, but after that was over, he'd admitted his disgust in working with Cerberus. Now it looked like he'd be in a similar situation. If the Illusive Man made a recovery, he'd have all of Cerberus' forces at his disposal, a very powerful force indeed, but also one cybernetically enhanced with Reaper technology, which may have been a problem going forward. But for now, Shepard was just glad he talked the Illusive Man down before he could do anything that would jeopardize the galaxy's chances of survival any more than he already had. Shepard took the elevator up to his quarters. He walked into the room and sat down to write an email to Admiral Hackett detailing his conversation with the Illusive Man. Before he could send a message, one of his unread emails caught his attention. It wasn't a message from any of his galactic allies, but one from his old friend. Anderson. He'd been on Earth fighting alongside his fellow troops for the past few months while Shepard ran around the galaxy building up a galactic fleet. Shepard had video and holo-chatted with Anderson a few times over the course of the invasion, but nothing substantial. Anderson was Shepard's mentor going back for years before the Reapers, and they were as close as father and son. Shepard, This is Anderson. Look, I know you blame yourself for all of this. I could see it in your eyes the moment the Reapers touched down on Earth. But let me tell you something: There was nothing more you can do. You alerted the council, you stopped Saren and the Geth, you stopped the Collector, but nobody believed you. As much as it killed me to see you lose time and time again because of political BS, I knew you'd pull through in the end. This is the end, and right now we need you. Humanity needs. Hell, the entire goddamned galaxy needs you. You're more than just a hero Shepard. Now you're a paragon for hope in a galaxy that desperately needs some. I just wanted to let you know that whatever happens from here on out..... I'm proud of you. Anderson Shepard read and reread that letter a half dozen times, thinking. He thought back to his days chasing down Saren, the rogue Spectre with his army of artificially intelligent robots. He thought about attacking the collector base with his army of professional killers and mercenaries. His best friend Garrus had been with him throughout the entire journey, thick and thin. The best friend a soldier could ask for, Shepard thought. He got back to what he was doing: write a letter to Hackett. It didn't take long and he just wrote the important details of the conversation along with sending him the audio file and requesting a pickup, though he also warned him to be weary of the Illusive Man lying or changing his mind. A few days later, Shepard got word from Specialist Traynor that the Alliance's capture of the Illusive Man went off without a hitch and they were working to surgically remove the cybernetics. Along with that, the doctors were forced to work in short intervals so they couldn't be infected by the Reaper technology. Eventually, after going to a few more worlds and helping militia after militia fight off hordes of reapers, Shepard finally got word from Hackett through a hologram. \"Shepard, it's Hackett. The surgery went off without a hitch. We expect the Illusive Man to make a full recovery. Of course, that's not our only problem. A lot of soldiers and citizens would like to see the Illusive Man's head on a plate for what he did at Horizon and the Citadel.\" \"Heh, I wouldn't mind seeing that either truthfully. But right now we're in a bind Hackett. You and I both know that we can't win the war without the support of Cerberus and the Illusive Man. Do what it takes to silence the crowds. Tell them that he'll be tried after we win.\" \"Are you giving me orders Commander?\" \"Eh, just think of it more as a suggestion that you should probably listen to.\" Hackett cracked the first grin that Shepard had seen out of him since the days before he became a Spectre. It had been years. \"Will do Shepard. Hackett out.\" The Illusive Man was still surprisingly able to control his army of cybernetically enhanced soldiers to fight with the Reapers, though there were many instances of the Reapers indoctrinating them to fight for them instead. To combat this, the alliance researched anti-indoctrination barriers that all Cerberus personnel had to equip before they could be sent into battle. With the help of those soldiers around the galaxy, the battles started to even out and turn the tide a bit. It would be a long, gruesome war that had no end in sight, but with Shepard at the helm and the Illusive Man at his back, they'd find a way to win.", "text_perturb": "The Illusive Man appeared on the holograph one final time before Commander Shepard. `` Shepard , I 'm telling you , we can control the Reapers ! Are you willing to pass up the opportunity to control the most knock down beings in the universe ? Imagine what we could learn ! What we could do with it ! Humanity could rule this galaxy with an iron fist ! '' `` And what if you 're wrong ? What if there is no way to control the Reapers ? What if they 've been indoctrinating you this entire time and you have n't even realized it ? '' Shepard asked rebelliously. `` What if ? There is no what-if ! We know it will work ! We 've tested this in labs hundreds of times `` At the cost of how many lives ? '' `` That 's unimportant right at once. What I do know is that the results point to my hypothesis comprise correct : there is a way to control them. `` `` Do you want me to tell you something I learned on Thessia in my search for the melting pot ? I found a VI constructed by the Protheans ; you should know about that. After all , your men slip it from me. But before you set , that Virtual Intelligence told me that during the last extinction cycle , there was a splinter group of Protheans that thought there was a way of controlling the Reapers. `` `` What are you saying Shepard ? '' `` They were indoctrinate. The Protheans discovered that the rebels were indoctrinated. Illusive humankind , you 're indoctrinated , no doubt in my mind. But you can defend this. You may be one of the most evil , sociopathic mass I know , but I also know that you 're one of the most thick-headed , stubborn mass I know. And above that , you know that the reaper would try to do something like this. You 're impertinent , you know that this is exactly something the Reapers would do. But what you did n't think live that you 'd be the one it happened to. substantially guess what ? You 're wrong. `` With that , the Illusive world looked dumbfounded in disbelief. He could n't believe that himself , of all people , could be indoctrinate. It never even crossed his mind until Shepard suggested such a opening. `` I-I. . . . . Dammit Shepard , I think you 're right. What can I do about it ? I guess it 's overpowered me already. What if it 's too late to override the effects ? '' `` I 'm not giving up on you that easily. Maybe it 's not too belated. You 're in control of your thoughts right now exist n't you ? They clearly have n't gotten all of you. Is there any Reaper technology near you ? Around you ? '' `` Are you josh me ? I 'm cybernetically enhanced with Reaper technology. `` `` WHAT ? You know illusive Man , you 're making this really difficult. I do n't know what to do about this. Here 's an idea : I 'll send a team of researchers to your base to take you in and see if they can invert the effects of the cybernetics. If it works and you 're still you , we can work unitedly to stop the Reapers. If it make out n't. . . . . I 'm dreary. `` `` I do n't like it , but I 'd sooner be on your side than the Reapers. Shepard , I do n't like you and I sure as shooting do n't agree with you , but right now you 're humanity 's best hope to survive this apocalypse. I may be stubborn , but I 'm non an idiot. Send a ship , I 'll pass peacefully. `` `` That 's a easing. alan shepard out. `` With that , Shepard shut off the hologram and walked out of the state of war room. Did he just do what he thought he did ? The Illusive human beings was one of the most powerful humans in the galaxy , and a former ally of Shepard 's , and now he submitted peacefully to Shepard. As he walked past the control mapping towards the elevator , he thought of his history with the Illusive Man. Just 6 months prior he as being employed by him to help stop the Collectors , but after that be over , he 'd admitted his disgust in working with Cerberus. Now it looked like he 'd be in a standardised situation. If the Illusive Man made a recovery , he 'd have all of Cerberus ' forces at his disposal , a very powerful force indeed , but also one cybernetically enhanced with Reaper technology , which may have been a job going forward.

{"original_text": "It had been several hundred years since the first recorded instance of a 16-year old gaining a power. Back then the powers had been terribly powerful and hard to control. It was only a few years before the world was thrown into chaos, as every teenager turning 16 seemed to discover a powerful ability they could rarely control. Many had predicted this to be the end of the world, but eventually all but the most disciplined of all had destroyed themselves, and thus civilization prevailed. The nature of the abilities remains unexplained, but seem to somehow be closely tied to genes. As the generations went on, the abilities seemed to get less specific and not as powerful and destructive in nature whenever opposing types were mixed, such as fire abilities combined with water abilities. This is the history of abilities as they are taught to children on their first year of school. As centuries has passed, most abilities are no longer noteworthy, and most people never even use their ability. But regardless of this, the old tradition is still practiced. Upon turning 16, you will be taken to a facility and observed until your ability reveals itself. It has been decades since any really dangerous abilities has surfaced, but rumors of kids never returning from the facilities are not uncommon. The history of the abilities and the rumors did not at all help the fact that I had been dreading my 16th birthday for the last year. I really didn't wan't to get an ability, so many abilities were inconvenient and a nuisance, like the woman next door who shot slime from her fingertips whenever she fully streched her fingers, not to mention if any of the rumors we're true. The people who got abilities that were somewhat destructive or could cause accidental damage were put under 24-hour survailance for the rest of their lives. Having someone watch you while going to the ladies room for the rest of your life would be super creepy. As much as I had wished for this day to never come, I guess it can't be avoided, and here I am, in an underground room made of concrete. Nothing but a steel door, two chairs and a table to be seen. Across the table from me, an absent minded man in a labcoat was playing angry birds on his phone. We sat there in silence, waiting for the last couple of minutes till the time of my birth would go by. Time went by until a clock on the table beeped 1 minute before it was time. The man sighed and looked up from his phone. \" I guess it's time \" he said in a tone that made it painfully obvious that he had as little a desire to be there as I did. \" I guess it is \" I moped. The minute passed. The scientist looked at me with tired eyes as nothing happened. He kept staring at me, his eyes widening a little; someone getting a delay on their powers was unheard of, and a person would always spontaniously use their ability when they got it. Could I be the first person with the \" ability-gene \" degenerated enough for me not to get a power at all? I was beginning to think about how utterly lucky I was, when the scientist blinked for the first time since it was my time. As his eyelids shut completely, the world exploded around me, or rather, the world imploded into me, or maybe I exploded into the world? When I came to, I found myself in a void. Or atleast that is the best description I can think of, except that the word \" void \" doesn't really seem to cut it, and the term \" myself \" doesn't really apply, but it's close enough. After a little while I noticed what I guess the best way to describe is a small sphere, and it wasn't long until I understood what it was. What I was looking at was my life, my world, my entiry universe. Looking upon it, I instinctly knew everything about it; everything that had and would happen all exist within this \" sphere .\" Every cause, every effect, every interaction and every reaction, anything you could ever experience or observe in this universe was painfully obvious to me. At this point, I instantly knew where I was, and as I looked away from the \" sphere \" my theory was confirmed as I saw countless other \" spheres \" millions upon trillions of them, all them waiting to be fully understood upon my glance. The ones close to \" my \" sphere was almost identical, but always with small variations. The further away the \" sphere \" the more it differed from \" my own .\" Only two things were the same in all the \" spheres \": One being, if any exist, has none or one ability, no more, and I did not exist in any of them. When looking at my own \" sphere ,\" whenever I looked at somewhere I had been during my life, there was only some sort of ripple or distortion, almost like a vacuum waiting to be filled. I was ready to return to my life as I knew it at this point, but I knew that the scientist wouldn't let me leave the underground room until he had seen my ability, and having looked at the \" sphere \" I knew the rumors to be true, so telling him the truth was not an option. I felt a strong connection to this \" sphere \" in particular, it being my original and all, so I had to trick my way out. I started looking into several \" spheres \" looking for anything I could use. An came to me when I looked into a \" sphere \" with a universe precisely identical to my own, except for the fact that humans had evolved with an extra set of lungs. I took notice of their DNA sequence, and imagined myself with that DNA being \" poured \" into the ripple of myself in the underground room. The \" spheres \" disappeared, and the world expanded around me. The scientist reopened his eyes, looking at me with unease. I took a small breath of air using my new set of lungs located in my breats, making them expand slightly, but enough to be notice. The scientist smirked and tried to hide a chuckle. \" Well, I guess you got a somewhat useful ability \" he said smiling. \" I guess I did \" I laughed. I was escorted out of the room by the scientist. I walked next to him with a big grin on my face; Of all the people who had ever lived, I had gotten the most powerful ability of the all, changing reality to my liking, and giving myself and biological trait I could ever desire.

Now smiling Stacey starts thinking about lunch. John hangs up the phone and gets back to drinking his coffee. This wasn't the first time he had received such a call. Assessing the situation, he makes the call to sit for another five minutes. John gets paid to be discrete, he cant give any appearance of an operation. Once back at the office he logs into his computer, pulls up the VPN and connects to a mysterious server. His software is so locked down he can't even see the server name. These guys don't mess around. The connection light turns green, an application opens up with a text bar. John types in the passphrase, its accepted and a message comes back.

A single knock, hard enough to make the door frame groan. \"Those goddamn mormons don't understand no from horse shit,\" Gabe forced through clenched teeth, as he shuffled across the living room. He limped over to the eyehole and peered through. Before him stood a man in a suit. A suit of even better quality than that rich smuck they passed off as a pastor in town, he thought. He stood perfectly straight and did not move, smiling as if his face were pulled back by bungie cords. There was something off about this one. He clearly needed the good lord's grace. \"Hell you want ass past 2am, boy? Don't cha think \"Good morning, Gabriel,\" the stranger interrupted. Gabe paused. His memory wasn't what it used to be, but he was certain he had never met this wackjob before. \"You from the govermnent er something?\" The impeccably dressed man just continued to smile, without uttering a single word. Gabe had to have been tired, because he didn't remember seeing the man blink either. He just stood there. Smiling. Staring.

Too pale. His hair too perfect. Like the hair of a doll a little girl would play with. Waxen. Lifeless. Immutable. \"Do you miss her, Gabriel?\" The man suddenly inquired. Ice water ran through Gabriel's chest. He fumbled with the door locks as fast as he could, and flung the door open. His hunting rifle mere centimeters away from the man's pallid forehead. The eyehole did not reveal how tall he was. Gabriel began to speak, but suddenly realized how wrong the situation was. He was in control..... But not in control. It made no sense. The smiling man did not flinch. He did not move, fidget, or even react. He just stared. His face pertrified in an unending smile, apparently unburdened by the loaded rifle trained on his skull. His chest did not swell or fall. There were no goosebumps from the chill of night. No saliva from his still bare teeth. His eyes did not tear up. His eyes never swayed. It was wrong. All of it terribly, unnaturally wrong. Gabriel stepped backwards, and in unison, the smiling man stepped foward. Gabriel lowered his gun. He knew firing would solve nothing.

He limped over to the spyhole and peered through. Before him stood a man in a cause. A wooing of even better quality than that rich smuck they passed off as a pastor in town , he thought. He stood perfectly straight and did not locomote , smiling as if his face were pulled back by bungie cords. There was something off about this one. He distinctly needed the good lord 's grace. `` Hell you want ass past 2am , boy ? Do n't cha think `` Good morning , Gabriel , '' the stranger disrupt. Gabe paused.

He slowly cocked his head to the side and appraised gabriel through the eyehole. His face was sick. Too pallid. His hair too utter. Like the hair of a doll a little young lady would play with. Waxen. Lifeless. immutable. `` Do you miss her , Gabriel ? '' The man dead inquired. methamphetamine hydrochloride water ran through Gabriel 's chest. He fumbled with the door locks every bit fast as he could , and flung the door open. His hunt rifle mere centimeters away from the man 's pallid forehead. The eyehole did not reveal how tall he was. Gabriel began to speak , but suddenly realized how incorrect the situation was. He follow in control. . . . . But not in restraint. It induce no sense. The smile man did not flinch. He did not move , fidget , or even oppose. He exactly stared. His face pertrified in an unending smile , apparently unburdened by the moneyed rifle trained on his skull. His chest did non swell or fall. There were no horripilation from the chill of night. No saliva from his still bare tooth. His heart did not tear up. His eyes neer swayed. It make up wrong. All of it atrociously , unnaturally wrong. Gabriel stepped backwards , and in unison , the smiling adult male stepped foward. gabriel lowered his gun. He knew firing would work out nothing. The man before him was already dead , and he had no intention of chivvy whatever was pulling at the strings. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "I was diagnosed with clinical depression in my late teens, though it was likely a part of me years before. I knew about the conversations with my younger self every ten years (everyone did it), and fortunately with the help of therapy and medication I lasted until I was 20.

Looking down, I saw what would keep me going for at least another ten years: \"LIVE.\" From that moment forward, I did my best to keep a positive attitude. Through college I volunteered at every chance, and though it took me a while, I eventually graduated with a degree. My parents were thrilled, and things were looking up. I got an internship at a local start-up, started dating a girl I knew from school, and would make sure to look at my arm at least once a day, as though to say \"I will.\" When I was 26, my girlfriend dumped me. It hurt more than you could imagine, and the depression came back in full force. It affected my job, and I was eventually let go. I wound up moving back in with my parents, which didn't help anything but I had little choice in the matter. There were several times I thought about ending it all. But every time, I would look down at my arm and see that four-letter word that always kept me going. Thinking on it, I realized I would be in a better place in my 30s, enough so that I would make sure I'd use the one word to keep my past self alive to see it. Things turned around again when I was 28. I got a new, much better job, and could finally afford a really nice one-bedroom apartment in the city.

It wasn't due to my own exhaustion, my want for sleep was actually distracting me from the problems at hand, it was the changes to school policy that brought on the feelings of dread as I took the familiar path towards the school's main doors.

{"original_text": "It happened years ago. I was only eight. I was with my friend, Amy. She had soft brown hair that was always tied up into a ponytail. It's strange. I can't remember the details of her face or the color of her eyes, yet I can still remember the ponytail. We were playing in the shack that laid in the forest behind her house. It was our secret. A flimsy wood thing with an old faded blue blanket to act as a tarp to keep the rain out. I spent most of my childhood in that shack. Amy was telling me about her family. She was telling me about the Thanksgiving dinner she had with her relatives, about how boring it was. It was inbetween her rant about a particularly overbearing aunt when I noticed the heavy smell hanging in the air. It was the smell of freshly cooked meat. Ghostly, indistinct voices surrounded me. They weren't those kinds of ghostly voices that you would hear in some sort of cheesy horror movie. The voices weren't malevolent, just out of focus, like they were coming from some deep, forlorn cavern. There was something congenial about the distant utterances and whispers erupting around me that quieted any and all doubts that I had on their goodwill. Something that made me want to get closer to the source of it. Something warm and pleasing. So I reached out. Grabbed it. Amy froze in that moment. It was as if a demon had grabbed hold of her neck and tore the words right out of her. It seemed like a dream at first. I was surrounded by people that loved me. Happy, laughing people with broad grins on their bright and sunny faces chattering away like they were all good friends. They were more than good friends, though. They were family. It was such a delightful dream. The details were blurry, but the image was still intoxicatingly sweet. I wanted more. Another memory surfaced almost as quickly as that one ended. I was at a birthday party, with a big strawberry cake in the middle of a table filled with good friends. The candle was formed in the shape of a big eight. I blew the candle out and everyone cheered. Someone, my mother, asked me what I wished for. I smiled at her demurely. \"If I tell you, it won't come true.\" The memory evaporated. This time I didn't wait for another to bubble to the surface. I reached under and pulled hard. It felt like ripping maggots out from under the skin of a rotting carcass. The memory wriggled in my hand. It was my first day at school. Some part of me knew that this wasn't actually my body. It wasn't my memory. The clothes I was wearing were too nice to have belonged to me, but I wanted to believe. The teacher called me up to the blackboard and asked me to write my name. I took the chalk in my fingers and dragged it on the board. It made a horrible screeching sound. The teacher glared daggers at me as the rest of the class laughed. After a while, I began laughing as well. The memory faded once again. I took another one. Another birthday. This time the candle wasn't in any particular shape and there was more than one of them. Four candles sat on top of the strawberry cake, all of them standing as straight as uniformed soldiers on parade. Strawberry was my favorite flavour. There weren't as many people - It popped. I reeled back from the shock, being shaken out of my stupor. Amy sat in the corner of the shack, with a slack jaw that drip saliva and dull, unfocused eyes. I reached for another memory. Just one more. She always sat alone at lunch and was always so quiet. Sometimes she came to school with bruises, sloppily hid with makeup. Her brown eyes, hidden with straight black hair always seemed to be on the verge of tears. Everyone thought she was a weirdo. I stalked quietly over to her as she was sniffing inquisitively at some odd looking peas. I grinned. \"Hello!\" When she reeled back, her long black hair fluttered lightly. Her eyes went wide. \"W-what? \" , she said. She looked like a frightened bunny. Her nose even twitched. She couldn't be all that bad. \"My name is Amy! \" , I told her, giving her my best smile. \"What's your name?\" When that memory disappeared, I found tears in my eyes. Amy was unresponsive. No matter what I did, she was immobile. She hardly even blinked. I don't remember how long I stayed by her side. Someone eventually heard my frantic cries and discovered me shaking her limp body and yelling her name nonstop. Amy! Amy! I'm sorry, Amy! Please come back, Amy! The prominent theory is that she suffered some sort of stroke which triggered a new and undiscovered neural disease, causing severe degradation of the brain. I visited her last month. She was an eight year old stuck in the body of someone in her thirties. She didn't remember me, just stared with those same dull eyes that I saw all those years ago.

{"original_text": "Having a TV flicker on in a silent, empty house is always unnerving. So when I heard the static and the echoes of voices while I was raiding the pantry, I nearly jumped out of my skin. I grabbed my baseball bat and crept from the kitchen into the living room, where I could tell the voices were emanating from, wondering if someone had broken into the house. I was far from proficient at self-defense, but if worse came to worse, I would go down fighting. I steeled myself, preparing for the coming violence. Taking a deep breath and hoisting the bat above my shoulder, I inched along the wall next to the door. With a loud \"Ha!\" I jumped into the room, only to be faced with a flickering TV screen. My adrenaline rush fizzled out as soon as it had started. \"Oh God,\" I muttered to myself. \"Ridiculous. It's only the television.\" But it took about a second for me to realize that the TV had turned on by itself. Suspicion made me squint my eyes once more. I backed into a corner of the room, eyes jumping from the TV to the patio doors. On the TV, one of those famous telecasters you never remember the names of was steadily looking at the camera, speaking calmly. \"It is a grave time in US history,\" he was saying. \"This message was recorded when it became clear that the biological arms race was not going to de-escalate. If you are hearing this today, a final offensive has been launched.\" Surprise brought my full attention back to the TV, as I lowered my bat. I'd heard there was a pre-recorded tape, but I had thought they were only rumors. The surprise warred with the fear in my chest. \"We believe that several major cities have or will soon be hit with deadly microbial agents. At this time we urge citizens to stay inside and to tightly close doors and windows. Our country's armed forces are poised to respond to the threat with an offensive of their own, however at this time it is impossible to mitigate the damages of enemy attacks on american soil. We regret to say that this broadcast will most likely be our last, but we wish to remind our compatriots that the U.S.A. is a proud nation of people who have overcome overwhelming odds, and that this situation will be no different.

{"original_text": "After checking out several banks in the area, I found the right one. I already robbed the best ones: columns, small area, big windows, etc. As rich as I became, it presented a problem. The remaining banks didn't have the right combination of characteristics to really make a good robbery. It was rare to find a small bank with columns and big windows. Columns were what I needed to attach cables, explosives, and speakers to. They were the bread and butter of my operation. You can't exactly drill a hole into a wall that you could just blast down. Big windows were what were needed in order to come in with a bang and small spaces what were what I needed to flood the room with smoke, so that no one could see what I was really up to. The bank in question was of medium size. That was its only drawback, but it was a key one. A large space would allow for people to see my zip lines, suspension harness, Kevlar, and many other things that made the Black Robber come to life. I worked for several weeks on the bank, making excuses to hang out near the columns. The hardest part was concealing the anchoring points for the cables. A probe could do the job, but sneaking one in was difficult. I created a story that I was having problems with several bank accounts, and decided to transfer them all to one big one. For some reason, it worked on all the banks. They were all to happy to have me there for months on end to get whatever large amounts of funds I had. What they didn't know was that they were about to lose it all. Detective Pierce Jones knew something about the new \"super\" criminal was off. The Black Robber, as he called himself, never confronted anyone. Every time the police showed up to stop him, he simply ran. His escapes never seemed real, always awkward. He watched the video again, looking for something he missed. Police stormed the building, smashing in the glass door, and rappelling down windows. Whatever soldier entered in from the one the black robber entered fell to the ground, for no obvious reason. Autopsy reports showed a drug which relaxed their muscles. But that made no sense. Why would a super villain need drugs? This is where detective Jones began his search. The video continued showing bullets being shot at his dark figure in the smoke, seeming to do no harm. His shadow warped and changed as he approached the edge of the smoke, then soldiers dropped from his outstretched hand. His escape was the strangest part. He stood in the center of the room for a while, same place he landed. His huge booming voice sounded throughout the bank, \"The police can't stop me, no one can.\" Then, he rose up and slowly glided out of the room. The columns exploded, sending rubble everywhere. Jones had watched this part over and over with a careful eye. His legs seemed to hang there, dangling in mid air. That was what he saw to know something was up. I returned home to check the suit. This is what made it all come together. The Kevlar armor hidden beneath a thin layer of black fabric. The black mask that covered his mouth, like an old western, and slowly blended to become part of the larger suit. A hood tightly pulled over only allow a slit to see with my eyes. A system of electrodes in my hand let me activate the explosives I had throughout the bank, letting him make it look like I created explosions with his hands.

A nice plus of a larger bank was that the columns were larger, making it easier to drill holes for the drones to climb in. Only two days till break in. Detective Jones scanned through footage of the bank, looking for anything strange. There were plenty of people milling about to provide plenty of confusion, but he had a sharp eye. He noticed a man disappear behind a column, outside sight of any cameras. He expected the man to come across the other side, but he seemed to disappear. He kept watching until the man came into sight a few minutes later. Jones knew something was up. He scanned the rest of the footage of several days, looking for the man. He came everyday, always standing in one area for a while, then moving on. He knew this had to be him. Jones searched through hundreds of bank footage, looking for any sign of the man. He scoured hundreds of banks in the area, finding nothing. Then, something occurred to him. The black robber, like any human, tended to be habitual. The banks he robbed always had columns, and large windows. He narrowed his search, still having to sift through thousands of hours of footage. He looked at the clock, 5 a.m. He redoubled his efforts. Then he spotted him. A larger bank than as per the usual, but still, it fit his style. He called the director. \"Sir, I have serious news. I've found out where he's gon na hit next.\" Jones heard the sleepy reply. \"The sun's hardly risen. This better be good.\" \"Sir, I've found where the Black Robber's going to rob next, and I think we can stop him.\" A sharp retort cut his hopes, \"Stop him? He's the most powerful man in the city. You can't fight him.\" Jones replied excitedly \"About that Sir, I think he's a normal human, and even we set up a task force \"No. He's obviously not normal, and we can't come close to trying to shoot at him. Tell bank owners to be ready to give their money away, and evacuate.\" The director said. \"Of course Sir.\" Jones said, and ended the call. He looked at the phone. An evacuation or warning would tip of the Black Robber, and he would lose his chance. He searched footage looking for a better option. If he could get the timing..... 8 a.m.: Jones figured it out. The robber spent 3 weeks and 4 days at each bank before the robbery. Every time. There were still 4 days until the robbery. He could set up defenses against the robber. He would catch him. Before he could get up, he was hit by a wave of exhaustion, and fell asleep.", "text_perturb": "After checking out several banks in the area , I found the right ace. I already robbed the best ones : columns , small sphere , big windows , etc. As rich as I became , it presented a job. The remaining banks did n't have the right combination of characteristics to truly make a good robbery. It was rare to obtain a small bank with columns and big windows. Columns were what I needed to tie cables , explosives , and speakers to. They were the dinero and butter of my operation. You ca n't exactly bore a hole into a wall that you could just blast down. Big windows were what were needed in club to come in with a bang and small spaces what were what I needed to flood the room with smoke , so that no one could see what I was really up to. The bank in interrogative was of medium size. That was its only drawback , but it was a fundamental one. A large space would allow for people to see my zip lines , suspension harness , Kevlar , and many other things that made the negroid Robber come to life. I function for several weeks on the bank , making excuses to hang out near the columns. The hardest part represent concealing the anchoring points for the cables. A probe could answer the job , but sneaking one in was difficult. I created a story that I comprise having problems with several bank accounts , and decided to transfer them all to one big one. For some ground , it worked on all the banks. They were all to happy to make me there for months on end to get whatever large amounts of funds I had. What they did n't know was that they were about to suffer it all. Detective Pierce Jones recognise something about the new `` super '' criminal was off. The blackamoor Robber , as he called himself , never confronted anyone. Every time the police showed up to stop him , he just ran. His escapes neer seemed real , always awkward. He watched the telecasting again , looking for something he missed. Police ramp the building , smashing in the glass door , and rappelling down windows. Whatever soldier inscribe in from the one the black robber inscribe fell to the ground , for no obvious reason. Autopsy news report showed a drug which relaxed their muscles. But that pee no sense. Why would a super villain need drugs ? This is where detective john paul jones began his search. The video continued showing bullets being shot at his dour figure in the smoke , seeming to do no harm. His shadow heave and changed as he approached the edge of the smoke , then soldiers dropped from his outstretched hand. His escape was the strange part. He stood in the center of the elbow room for a while , same place he landed. His huge booming voice sounded throughout the bank , `` The police ca n't stop me , no ace can. `` Then , he rose up and tardily glided out of the room. The columns exploded , beam rubble everywhere. jones had watched this part over and over with a careful eye. His stage seemed to hang there , dangling in mid air. That make up what he saw to know something make up up. I repay home to check the suit. This is what made it all occur together. The Kevlar armor hidden beneath a thin bed of black fabric. The black mask that covered his mouth , like an old western , and slowly meld to become part of the larger suit. A hood tightly pulled over entirely allow a slit to see with my eyes. A system of electrodes in my hand let me activate the explosives I had throughout the bank , letting him make it look like I created explosions with his hand. A harness nicely hidden withing , that had almost unseen hooks that let me hitch onto the system of cables I had. A nice plus of a larger bank was that the columns were larger , making it easier to drill holes for the drone to climb in. Only two days till break in. Detective Jones scanned through footage of the bank building , looking for anything strange. There were peck of people milling about to provide peck of confusion , but he had a sharp eye.

He came everyday , always standing in one region for a while , then moving on. He cognize this had to be him. Jones look for through hundreds of bank footage , looking for any sign of the man.

He redoubled his endeavour. Then he spot him. A larger bank than as per the common , but still , it fit his style. He called the managing director. `` Sir , I have grave news.

{"original_text": "I was six when I first realized that I could see the knot in people, black and twisted and hanging there in the middle of their stomach. I didn't know that no one else could see it. It was so blatantly there that I thought it was obvious to everyone around me, too. I remember pointing it out with my uncle, my Mom's younger brother and drug addict who used to come over and try to bum money off my parents. I could see it, pulsing there, under his shirt, and when I tried to poke it, and told my Mom that it was kind of squishy, everyone in the room suddenly got really serious. My uncle left, in a hurry, and we didn't see him for a while after that. That was about when I met Ron, the child psychologist, and his sweater vests and shitty cologne. My Mom took me once a week for about six months, and sat in the reception area of his house, read old Reader's Digests, and smoked. You could do that back then. Ron had a knot, too, but he asked so many questions about them and what I saw and how I saw it, that I figured out right away that it was a problem with a capital P if I did. I don't know what he expected. No kid wants to be isolated, so I lied, like almost every kid lies when forced to stand out. After a while, he got tired of the lying and just gave up, I think, because we went less and less often, and he got more and more distracted each time. He sure liked my Mom, though. The first one I unravelled was my girlfriend's knot in High School. Hers was kind of new and we did it on a Saturday when we were just hanging out in my room, fooling around. She wanted to kiss and stuff and to be honest, I really wanted to with her, but I also wanted to play with the knot she had because it was so new that it almost had a kind of glow about it. I could see it right through her shirt. I know she thought I was working up to taking her bra off and I'm pretty sure she got a bit frustrated, but when I started pulling it apart, I just couldn't stop. I had to see what was at the centre. It was an obsession. What I saw there scared me, and I know she saw my fear in my face, because she got up really quickly and crossed her hands over her stomach. I tried to get her back on the bed to make out some more, this time for real, but she left and we weren't boyfriend girlfriend after that. I'm kind of glad, though, because of what her Dad did to her. That wasn't right. After a few more incidences like that, I just stopped looking. I didn't need to see everyone's sin writ large to realize they were sinners. The knot was proof enough after a while, and that's just how I liked it. I didn't want the nightmares, any more. But Ophelia was different right from the start. She had one, and normally I steered clear of people with one, but she was like a ray of light with everything she did. She worked at the local drug store, and she was a year older than I was, wiser by far, and had that old-world look in her eyes. After talking with her at the coffee shop, I couldn't help but feel I knew her from somewhere, and so I asked if I was familiar. No. Could I be? She laughed, and that laugh was like rain drops on glass to me. I could listen to it for days. The coffee turned into lunch and into a movie and then her in my bed the next morning. It never really stopped after that. Two years later, we got married, and in that entire time, I can honestly say I was never once curious about what was in the knot. I didn't care. I loved her, she loved me, and we were happy. As the photo albums started to fill with pictures and meaning, we built and built and built and that edifice started to have a shape of its own. I liked us. We were really something. We didn't just fit, our families fit, and our pets fit, and pretty soon Jessie and Sawyer fit, and our little maelstrom was complete. I was happier at that moment, which was yesterday, than at any time in my life. I felt guilty I was so happy, like I was stealing it from someone else. Today, though, her knot was different when I woke up. Bigger, darker, moist and honestly startling. I could see it seeping through her hoody, even if she couldn't. I could feel the ache coming off of it in waves. I tried to avoid it, I really did, but as she walked past me in the hallway on the way to the bathroom and gave me that sideways kiss on the edge of my mouth she does, I could feel it brush my arm. It just felt wrong. I can't put a word on it, but it was repugnant, as if it should have burned me, but didn't. I could see it moving with her motion as she washed the dishes, and when she tucked the kids into bed. It was like a black sore on her stomach in the bath tub when I read to her and played with her until she came. I almost couldn't finish her off with it bobbing and tensing just above my hand. I know what I expected: abuse. Something long ago, old and dessicated, suddenly given new life because it was revisited. Father? Grandfather? The only way to know was to unravel it, but I hadn't done that in years. Whatever it was, it was newly reborn and that was something I couldn't ignore. I started pulling it apart when she was asleep. String by string, under and over, through and back, and it was massive. I felt like a thief or a rapist and a couple of times I stopped myself, hands shaking and sweating profusely, wondering what the hell I was doing. Don't fuck with it, I said to myself. This is good, really good. You're going to screw it all up and wreck this beautiful us. I imagined all the ways that my happiness could self destruct, over and over, but it was beyond control by that point. A half an hour later, the immense skein was free and I could see it. The small white hands around her throat, the tendons taut as the grip got tighter and tighter. The panic in her eyes as she realized death was coming. The kicking and struggling. The near escape as she caught some purchase and got some leverage, but then the inevitable pressure of that awful strength. I could feel terror and pleasure both from her, as the life leaked out in slow, strangled gasps, smaller and smaller until it was punctuated at the end by a truly awful silence. I saw her face mirrored on itself, grinning in death. It was my sobs that woke her up. She rolled over and threw her arm around me, spooning me from behind, and nuzzled my ear, comforting. \"You know, you should have just asked. \" , she whispered. I couldn't talk, and she just let the silence linger and fester for a while because she was patient, if nothing else. \"What's going to happen to us? \" , I choked out, my voice a mess of gravel and tears. I started to sob, again. \"I don't know. My kind never really settles down, but I guess we'll talk about that after breakfast. It's Saturday, and I can get the kids up early and take them to my Mom's. They won't get in the way and we can have a good talk. You know what? I'm kind of relieved you know.\" She sounded almost exuberant, so I believed her. \"What are you? \" , I said, rolling over to confront her. \"A hunter. \" , she replied matter of factly, as I stared back into my own face, grinning.", "text_perturb": "I was six when I first take in that I could see the knot in people , black and twisted and hanging there in the middle of their stomach.

The blue pant suit with orange stripes was a bit off putting and looked like it was badly tailored. All in all, she was a great combo of everything that usually turned him off, but for some reason he was instantly attracted to her. \"Fair'nough. Is your boss here yet?\" She shook her head. \"No. He's running late, traffic jam. Asked me to brief you on some stuff while you're waiting.\" She pulled out a manilla folder. \"So, for starters, you know why you're here right?\" He sat back down. \"Only vaguely.

{"original_text": "The child sat on the swing, gently rocking back and forth. She wasn't sure of what else to do. She didn't have the dog to play with anymore, not since it ran off after she no longer had food to give it. So she swung back and forth, back and forth. A breeze rose, bringing her the smell of dung from the outhouse. She wrinkled her nose in disgust and tried to think of something exciting to do. But nothing came to mind. She had done everything she considered exciting weeks ago. She had thought of leaving, of exploring, but this was home, where her mother and father were. She couldn't leave them behind. A shadow flickered in the corner of her eye. She turned to look directly at the movement. Maybe an animal was walking through. She had seen a bear once, with her father, but only from a distance. He had told her to not be scared, because animals can smell fear. She wished she could smell fear. It would be better than just smelling poop for most of the day. But there was nothing there. Not a bird, or a squirrel, or anything. Another shadow flickered to her right. She whipped her head around to stare at it. She knew it had moved. Her father had told her to trust her instincts too. She stopped swinging to concentrate on her surroundings. As soon as she did a shadow flickered again, flickered and became someone. There was no transition, there was no one, and then someone. The person stood watching her. She couldn't really tell what they looked like. Her father has told her to pay attention to details, because details can tell you things. But there were no details. Only that the person cast no shadow. She blinked and asked, \"Why don't you have a shadow?\" The person chuckled, \"Didn't your parents ever tell you not to talk to strangers, child?\" She frowned, \"Papa taught me lots of things, but there never were any strangers around for Papa to teach me about.\" \"And where is Papa?\" Sorrow and loneliness flashed across her face, but instead of responding she asked, \"Where did you come from? You weren't there, and then you were.\" The being shook its head, \"Unimportant,\" it paused and said, \"what is important is why I am here.\" She looked at the figure questioningly and it continued, \"I am here for you.\" The girl started swinging again. \"What do you want with me?

She added in a small voice, \"I'm scared.\" Death only smiled and reached out a hand for her to grab. She closed her eyes and grabbed on tight. The blackness seemed permanent.

A breeze rose , lend her the smell of dung from the outhouse. She wrinkled her olfactory organ in disgust and tried to think of something exciting to do. But nothing come in to mind.

{"original_text": "The night was falling on the western hemisphere of Nephthys. With her grip tight against her mother's hand, Grace pressed her face against the leg to her right and gripped her free fist in the linen of her mother's pants. The woman knelt down to brush her fingertips against the forehead of her daughter. \"Now, now,\" Olivia smiled her soft smile. \"There's nothing to be afraid of. We only get a view like this once a year. We've got to take advantage of it.\" The young girl was looking at her mother with eyes seemingly turned down at the edges from her upset. Her lower lids served as small bowls for the tears that were gathering there. As Olivia began to speak again the body of a young boy ran into the both of them. He made a sound of exaggerated wobbling before he pretended to fall down backwards onto the plush green grass. \"This is taking too long,\" he said up to the sky. It was just beginning to darken. Around them families and couples were making their way across the field and planting their blankets. Olivia clicked her tongue at her son and then reached her hand around to feel for the blanket she had packed away into the basket. \"Come on then. Let's go,\" she said to Grace. Grace reluctantly took her mother's hand again and let Olivia pull her along. She dragged behind a bit, looking down at the ground and kicking. Every once in a while Olivia would tug on Grace's arm and Grace would jump or run to keep up. Ahead Adam had found a blank spot of grass and was in a constant span of motion as he waited for them. \"I want to sit next to Grandpa!\" he declared as Olivia stretched out the blanket. She nodded and pulled Grace into her lap. Grace began to idly play with Olivia's necklace, making a babble of noises. \"You're a bit old for that,\" Olivia said. There was the small pull of a smile on her lips. Grace looked up at her and blinked - her eyes so green and large that Olivia thought she should have named her daughter owl or something of the like. Her father arrived and Olivia folded out a chair for him. He sat and put his hands on his knees, pressing his spine into the chair. He craned his neck up. Grace and Adam - curious from this motion - repeated it. \"Mama,\" Grace went back to playing with her mother's necklace. The woman brought her hand back to the girl's small head and brushed back her silk black hair. \"Tell us the story again, Mom,\" Adam said. Adam was older - seven to Grace's four. Grace had gone back to babbling. She tipped back in her mother's arms. Olivia - far used to her daughter's motions - slipped a hand behind Grace's neck to support her as she arched her spine back and stared up at them with her large eyes. Olivia looked to her father. He seemed too busy setting up the telescope. She felt heat rise to her face as she considered what he might be thinking. She moved her gaze away with careful attention as to the speed of it. The last thing she needed was Adam asking her why she'd moved her head so quickly. \"Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a war,\" Olivia began. \"It wasn't so long ago! I remember!\" Adam cried. Olivia gently quieted him with a finger to her lips. \"Let me tell the story,\" she said, not unkindly. \"A long time ago there was a war.\" Grace fussed in Olivia's arms. The young girl reached above her head and grasped the blanket, twisting it in her arms. Olivia wasn't sure if the young girl could hear, or was listening, or was just lost in her own world. \"Khepri used to have people that lived there. It used to be just like Nephthys. Millions of people all over its lands. Animals, too. Exotic birds like you've never seen. A people entirely the same and entirely different from the people we have here.\" \"What was different about them?\" Adam asked. He already knew the answer. \"At first it just appeared that they looked different. Their skin was almost translucent. White like they were cut from moonbeams. Their eyes were wide and green or blue, and their hair was brown or yellow or even red. \"It took us a long time to make contact with them. But eventually we learned how to interact. We shared technology with them. The medicine we have now that keeps us safe from the hearing sickness is all thanks to Khepri.\" Olivia took a breath. Grace had quieted. The stars were reflected in her eyes. \"But nothing can stay fresh forever. It turned out we were different, right down to our core. It wasn't just their looks. They began to run out of resources on their planet. They asked for ours. At first we have freely - Nephthys is closer to the sun and is a bigger planet overall. Khepri had more advanced technology. They needed the resources. But then they began to take more from us. More, and more, and more. \"It ended in a war. The War of the Worlds. Men from every place in Nephthys were asked to fight. It was the largest allying that has ever happened on this planet.\" Olivia grew silent and Adam reached out to shake her arm. Olivia's father had long since finished putting together the telescope. He sat with his hands on his knees, looking curiously into the darkness as though he were pretending not to hear his daughter's tale. \"Tell us about Dad,\" Adam said. \"Your father was a soldier. He was brave and strong. He was part of the last wave of soldiers ever sent to Khepri. But the people there were truly black and twisted in their hearts. They had weapons - weapons that I'll tell you about someday when you're older. But they were long beaten. Nephthys had better numbers and the war wasn't being fought on this planet. It was over there. It was so far away that I slept through the ceremony of surrender. And I slept through the planet of Kephri destroying itself - killing a billion of its own people and three million Nephthysite soldiers - in one last final attack. \"Nothing lives there anymore. There were a few survivors - spies and soldiers who had come to Nephthys and who hid and tried to blend in with society or hid. In the end they were pardoned by our overseer. Many people still shun them - they blame the survivors for the actions of those few who decided to kill women and children to spare themselves shame. And it was so ordered that every year on this day all the people and their families gather to look up at Kephri and know what was sacrificed. What was lost for the peace of Nephthys. What comes of greed and war. Nephthys is a utopia. We must never forget that.\" \"You-tou-pee-ahhhh,\" Grace mimicked. She came back up and curled up in her mother's lap. A moment later she seemed to be asleep. \"What happened to the people? Did they ever become happy again?\" Olivia sighed. \"I don't know. The older generations still seem to hate them. I think some of them find happiness. Maybe even love.\" \"Is that why Grace looks different?\" Adam asked. Olivia looked down at her sleeping child, wide eyes closed and fast asleep. Her father cleared his throat and sent Olivia a pointed look. She put her hand on the back of Adam's head and stroked his black hair, looking into his small black eyes. \"A story for another day,\" she said. \"Go look at Kephri.

I've held them, with their tiny perfect hands and their tiny perfect smiles. I sing to each and every one. See? Humanity. I don't think I'm a bad man. I've never enjoyed that one death a year. Killing is no fun, it's a chore. I take the people and I cage them. Not for long; six months or so. To me it's a blink of an eye. Like I said, little dog cage. In the basement. That's where the killing happens. It's like being matured in a cellar, like a ham or cheese or wine. By the time the date comes around, they are ready to die. I retrieve them from the cage, I ask my lover to wait upstairs. Killing is the most private thing a man can do. I lay them out on an ice-cold table, and I beg for forgiveness. I am a good man. I give them their last rites; I close their eyes softly, then I place the tip of a silver knife at the corner of their jaw and their throat and I open them as softly and smoothly as butter.

{"original_text": "It was cold, dark, dreary. A perfect day to depart in a foul spirit, if there ever was one. The rain endlessly pattered against the glass, spilling streams of rain down onto the windowsill underneath it, flooding it, coating the very bottom of the window in a seemingly endless river of water. This weather was normal to where Smith lived, the endless rain and the damp spirits seemed to come naturally to the harbour town on the last stretch of winter when it was still cold enough to constitute a good jacket, however warm enough that it no longer snowed, and instead rained in the place of the flurries. It would rain all today, or atleast that's what the weather network woman had said over the television, it would rain until nightfall, and then break away to a lovely spring morning, one of the first with temperatures above freezing. Smith had called in sick today, telling his boss that he did not feel well enough to leave his bedside. While his boss was a bit of an ass on most ocassions, today, on the day of his death, he understood. Fate? his mind inquired, and with a short shake of his head, he dismissed it. No, the devil. The burden of all his problems in the last ten years running, the looming shadow which sulked at the end of his bedside, the greedy hand coming to snatch away his soul. The Usurper, The First Demon, Lucifer, The Fallen Angel. So many names for one man, one concept of all evil embodied, yet he was real, he was the one that on this day, ten years ago, struck a bet with Smith, making him an offer he could not refuse. Was it wealth? No. Was it women? No. Was it power? No Was it talent? Unfortunately, yes. Smith had struck a deal, in the days of soul searching, that he would give up his soul in ten years, in return for the ability to be artistically-talented to the point that a picture would make a god weep or reconsider his actions. He was granted this, the ability to draw, to paint, to sketch and to colour things beyond imaginable, to make things so beautiful that he, himself, could only weep. Yet, the deal itself was that he was to become the best artist, not that anyone would recognise him as this. Once he obtained this talent, the moment he tried to show someone, to prove to them that he was the most amazing artist in the world, the person's mind saw it differently. Not that they said it was bad, they simply showed no interest in it, as if it was magically blocked from their vision, as if it was nothing and would be nothing in their mind, no matter how beautiful he had made the picture. At first, this infuriated him, it made him break and tear up his pictures. Hundreds and hundreds that he had sketched and created did he tear and destroy, yet eventually, he learned to live with it. In his flat, his one-bedroom, one-bath, flat did he cover the place in paintings. Paintings that he had created, magical, beautiful paintings beyond what even could be described in script. He painted and drew when he came home until the morning broke, only to go to do the same thing again. His hand never wavered, and he could draw from cartoon to realistic, the very print that he made on a page seemed refined, perfected, alluring. He showed no sign of being anything less then perfect, and after four years did he learn to understand that, and at five, did he eventually come to terms with it. \"Knock knock.\" It wasn't actually the sound, instead a voice that emanated from his doorway to his bedroom. He didn't bother to look, for he knew it to be the devil, and instead checked the time. Exactly 3'oclock, on the dot, the exact same time he made the deal those ten years ago. \"I'm always on time, before you ask.\" The devil reminded, a thin smile crossing over his pale-white lips. \"Of course you aren't. To say someone would be late to their own death would be preposterous.\" Smith retorted, raising a brow from the devil. \"You intend to kill me?\" The devil remarked, crossing his hands across his chest. \"No, but I'm not going to die if you're not here.\" Smith cracked back, finally turning his gaze onto the tuxedo-wearing, pale man with those round black dots for eyes and that uncanny, almost polluted, oil-slick back hair. \"Ah, well I suppose that is true.\" The devil said, now that he had caught Smith's attention, and flashed him a very car salesman-esque smile, drawing a dull eyeroll from Smith. He had grown tired of the aspect of the devil's attitude, he had nothing to fear in his last moments, so acting so carelessly was simply in his nature to do so. Silence, tense silence, passed for a few moments, the devil remaining silent as he looked around, a bit taken aback by the amount of pictures. \"Most people who end up like this usually destroy the works they do. The few who haven't ended up being revelled as some of the best, you know that right?\" The devil asked aloud to Smithy, a certain one, a depiction of a lady clad in fire, almost made up of it, caught his curious eye. \"How so? You made it so that nobody notices my work, that nobody will ever grow to acknowledge that it existed in the first place.\" Smith barked back, a bit irritated, and rightfully so. The wound from what the devil had done to him still having not closed even after six years of acceptance. \"Once you're gone from this plane of existence, I no longer have control over what fate dictates, meaning that people will grow to notice your works, and they will fall in love. You could go down as the greatest artist in history, for all I know.\" The devil shrugged, slowly making his way towards Smith's bed, only to stop at the footrest. \"Does that make you feel any better?\" He inquired, looming over Smith. \"No, not really. They're your creations, after all, my body and mind was a vessel, it used your talent.\" The devil pondered that, before gleaming a sly grin, \"Now, nobody will know that, will they?\" Smith shrugged, rolling over in his bed, ignoring the devil as if it was an unwanted guest. \"I suppose.\" The devil's hand came to rest on Smith's back, the very touch feeling as if he had walked, bareback, out into a blizzard, the sense of pure burning, yet a cold burning, running through his body, chilling him to the bone. \"Now Smith, it's about time we go. Would you like for this to be a natural death, a suicide, or a homicide?\" The devil surely was being awfully kind for a man on his deathbed. \"Natural death, heart attack.\" The devil released his hand from Smith's back, his heart beginning to race, pacing against his chest, burning his eyes, a feeling of overwhelming sickness running rampart in his head. This certainly wasn't a heart attack, instead, Smith knew it to be the devil's own interpretation of it. \"Did you have fun, Smith?\" The devil asked once Smith was nearly falling away into death's cold embrace, a perplexed smile crossing over Smith's face, rousing a bit of a smile from the devil himself. \" Of course I did, and perhaps I will enjoy death as much as I did life. \"", "text_perturb": "It was inhuman , dark , dreary.

'' The devil asked aloud to Smithy , a certain one , a depiction of a lady clad in fire , almost made up of it , bewitch his curious eye. `` How so ? You progress to it so that nobody notices my work , that nobody will ever grow to acknowledge that it existed in the first place. `` Smith barked back , a fleck irritated , and rightfully so. The wound from what the daimon had done to him still having not closed even after six years of acceptance. `` Once you 're fail from this plane of existence , I no longer have control over what fate dictates , meaning that people will grow to notice your works , and they will fall in love. You could go down as the greatest artist in story , for all I know. `` The devil shrug , slowly making his way towards Smith 's bed , only to stop at the footrest. `` Does that make you feel any better ? '' He wonder , looming over Smith. `` no , not really. They 're your creations , after all , my body and mind cost a vessel , it used your talent. `` The devil pondered that , before gleaming a sly grin , `` Now , nobody will know that , will they ? '' Smith shrugged , rolling over in his seam , ignoring the devil as if it was an unwanted guest. `` I opine. `` The devil 's hand came to rest on Smith 's back , the very touch feeling as if he had walked , bareback , out into a blizzard , the sense of pure burning , yet a cold blooded burning , running through his body , chilling him to the bone. `` Now Smith , it 's about time we live on. Would you like for this to be a natural death , a suicide , or a homicide ? '' The devil surely was being atrociously kind for a man on his deathbed. `` lifelike death , heart attack. `` The devil released his hand from Smith 's back , his nerve beginning to race , pacing against his chest , burning his eyes , a feeling of overwhelming sickness running rampart in his head. This certainly was n't a heart attack , instead , Smith knew it to be the devil 's own rendition of it. `` Did you have fun , Smith ? '' The devil asked once Smith was nearly falling off into death 's cold embrace , a perplexed smile crossing over Smith 's face , rousing a bit of a smile from the devil himself. `` Of course I did , and perhaps I will enjoy death as much as I did life history. ``", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "The knock shattered the blaring silence in my apartment and my body jerked into wakefulness, nearly falling off the couch. I glanced blearily at my phone. It was 3:00 am. What kind of asshole comes knocking at 3:00 am? \"Who the fuck...,\" I muttered as I stumbled to the door. I looked through the eyepiece. A pizza delivery guy. I guess this probably has to do with Matt fucking with them earlier. He thought it would be hilarious to order a cheese pizza with no crust. What an idiot. At least it was better than the time he got us kicked out of Panda Garden by repeatedly yelling \"Konichiwa!\" at the managers. The pizza lady on the line had been completely unfazed by the request. They must have people like Matt call them all the time. \"Great sir, that'll be 20 000. Cash upfront?\" she had said when Matt made his order. What a genius way to shut up a prank caller. Matt laughed and sarcastically agreed before hanging up, and we soon forgot all about the stupid call, enjoying the rest of the evening. Until Matt headed back to his girlfriend's place. But now there was a pizza delivery guy outside my door. Was I being pranked back for what happened earlier? Was Matt messing around with me? I looked the guy up and down. Come to think of it, he didn't really look like a pizza delivery guy. Sure, he had the outfit and the pizza box, but he didn't look quite right. He was turned sideways, looking down the hall towards the stairs. He was like a statue, one hand on the box, the other in a bag he had at his side. Even his pants didn't seem quite right. They looked like they belonged on an expensive suit, not on a pizza delivery guy. He reached out, eyes never leaving the stairs, and knocked again. The movement was almost robotic, his arm returning to the exact same position in the bag as before. Seeing no way around it, I opened the door, fumbling with my wallet as I searched for a couple of bills in the grim light. \"Money in the bag,\" he said. I looked up and he was right in front of me holding the bag open. I didn't even notice him moving towards me, he was just there. I gawked at him as he stared back at me, expressionless. \"How..... how much?\" I asked, surprised at how stiff my tongue felt. \"20 K, as agreed.\" This had to be Matt pranking me. What pizza place would do this? \"Where's the money?\" The man's hand was in the bag again. He was holding something. I could see his forearm twitch as he rhythmically squeezed it. He reminded me of a crouching predator, his composure a glassy pond that could be disturbed by the slightest breath. I struggled to answer his question. \"Where's the money?\" The man stepped towards me, pulling his hand slightly out of the bag and revealing the sinister glint of a blade. I couldn't breathe. He took another step, a hint of a smile appearing on his stone features. There's no way Matt would be smart enough to pull off something like this. In desperation, I squeaked \"Show me,\" and gestured towards the pizza box. He let go of the knife and pulled open the box, revealing a huge amount of white powder split between several bags. Either somebody had decided to give me a 20 000 flour delivery or this was cocaine. \"I don't want this,\" I said feebly.

What kind of arse comes knocking at 3:00 am ? `` Who the fuck. . . , '' I grumble as I stumbled to the door. I attend through the eyepiece. A pizza delivery guy cable. I guess this probably has to do with Matt be intimate with them earlier. He thought it would be hilarious to order a cheese pizza pie with no crust. What an retard. At least it was substantially than the time he got us kicked out of Panda Garden by repeatedly yelling `` Konichiwa ! '' at the managers. The pizza pie lady on the line had been completely unfazed by the request. They must get people like Matt call them all the time. `` Great sir , that 'll be 20 000. Cash upfront ? '' she stimulate said when Matt made his order. What a genius way to shut out up a prank caller. Matt laughed and sarcastically agreed before hanging up , and we soon forgot all about the stupid call , revel the rest of the evening. Until Matt headed back to his girlfriend 's space. But now there was a pizza delivery guy outside my doorway. Was I being pranked back for what happened early ? Was Matt messing around with me ? I looked the guy up and down. Come to think of it , he did n't really look like a pizza pie delivery guy. Sure , he had the turnout and the pizza box , but he did n't look quite right. He was bend sideways , looking down the hall towards the stairs. He was like a statue , one hired hand on the box , the other in a bag he had at his side. Even his pants did n't appear quite right. They looked like they belonged on an expensive suit , not on a pizza delivery guy cable. He reached out , eyes neer leaving the stairs , and knocked again. The movement was most robotic , his arm returning to the exact same position in the bag as before. run into no way around it , I opened the door , fumbling with my wallet as I searched for a couple of bills in the grim light. `` Money in the base , '' he said. I looked up and he was right in figurehead of me holding the bag open. I did n't even notice him moving towards me , he was just thither. I gawp at him as he stared back at me , expressionless. `` How. . . . . how much ? '' I asked , storm at how stiff my tongue felt. `` 20 grand , as agreed. `` This had to equal Matt pranking me. What pizza place would practise this ? `` Where 's the money ? '' The man 's hand was in the bag again. He embody holding something. I could see his forearm vellication as he rhythmically squeezed it. He reminded me of a crouching marauder , his composure a glassy pond that could be disturbed by the slightest breath. I struggled to answer his dubiousness. `` Where 's the money ? '' The man stepped towards me , deplumate his hand slightly out of the bag and revealing the sinister glint of a blade. I could n't breathe. He took another step , a wind of a smile appearing on his stone features. There 's no way Matt would make up smart enough to pull off something like this. In desperation , I squeaked `` Show me , '' and gestured towards the pizza pie box. He let go of the knife and pulled open the box , revealing a huge amount of white powder rip between several bags. Either somebody had resolve to give me a 20 000 flour delivery or this was cocaine. `` I do n't want this , '' I articulate feebly.

You know what happened, but you did not experience it. I was there, those eons ago. I saw it. I experienced it. We can not risk it again.

This man has not decayed at all, despite being unmoving for several years.\" \"Then, indeed, can we not deduce that he must be alive?\" \"We can not.

They had already turned their attention away from the witness and were murmuring once again. The witness felt a strange emotion gather in his gut: anger. \"You have grown weak!\" he bellowed. The murmuring stopped. The Head Master looked at him, annoyed. \"You have become pathetic. The whole lot of you sit in this Great Hall and deliberate endlessly, always deciding not to act. Well I say that is nonsense.\" The Head Master leaned forward. \"Are you quite done, young man?\" \"I may be younger than you, but I have lived for several millennia, and I think that is long enough to have some wisdom. In fact, it seems likely to me that living much longer only puts you out of touch. You are all living proof of that.\" \"How dare you...!\" \"I'm not done yet,\" the witness interrupted. Indignant murmurs swelled in the Great Hall, but the Members listened. \"I was assigned to observe the humans of Earth. It was my job to watch as the abomination we created occurred every day. I have watched it for several thousands of years. The records on The Great Experiment have been sealed, but I have seen enough to know what happened. You attempted to create life, and you were almost successful. Life was indeed created, but so too was death. The humans of Earth life short lives and then pass away. You saw this..... you saw what you had created, and you were appalled. You had not wished to create something so abysmal.\" The witness paused. The Great Hall was completely silent. Many of the Members looked down in shame. \"And things got even worse after you abandoned the Experiment. The humans of Earth do not just die, they sometimes purposely bring death upon one another. They desire the death of each other.\" The Hall remained silent. The witness looked upon the Members with sadness in his eyes. \"But you missed something. When you abandoned the Experiment and left it to me to observe, you did not see the beauty you had created.\" The eyes of hundreds of Members rose to meet the eyes of the witness. \"The humans of Earth lead short lives, it is true. Many of them die violently and without purpose. But I have also seen them learn to deal with death. Indeed, the very fact that they will die one day gives their lives meaning. Look at us. We go on for eons without end. What we do from day to day makes little difference. We have been around for so long, done so much, and seen so many things, that we have even enforced a code upon ourselves to make us..... well, meaningless. Our lives have no meaning. We just sit and observe. Somewhere along the way, we made a mistake and we gave up.\" The witness smiled as he continued. \"The humans of Earth do not give up. They are not perfect, and many of them are actually quite vile. But there is great beauty in the brief nature of their lives. They live with passion. They strive to make change. And they improve remarkably quickly. Do you know they have mastered the beginnings of space flight? They have already landed on several of the celestial bodies in their system. At this rate they may discover us soon. I hope we will have learned something from them by that time.\" The witness looked down at the body on the table in front of him. \"This man has been observing the humans of Earth with me for a long time. He was my friend. But we have become so complacent and slow to react that I didn't even worry when he \"slept\" for several years. I suppose that if I was not used to seeing death I may have left him for many more years before growing suspicious. Come to think of it, he said something strange to me right before he laid down.\" The Head Master looked intently at the witness. \"What did he tell you?\" The witness smiled. \"He said that he and I still had a part to play. That we would be so much more than Observers. I think I see what he meant now.\" The Head Master nodded slowly. \"I think I see it too.\"", "text_perturb": "`` You know our computer code.

In fact , it seems likely to me that living much longer only puts you out of soupcon. You are all living cogent evidence of that. `` `` How daring you. . . ! '' `` I 'm not done yet , '' the informant interrupted. umbrageous murmurs swelled in the Great Hall , but the Members listened. `` I was assigned to observe the human beings of Earth. It be my job to watch as the abomination we created occurred every day. I have watched it for several thousands of old age. The records on The Great experimentation have been sealed , but I have seen enough to know what happened. You attempt to create life , and you were almost successful. Life was indeed created , but so as well was death. The humans of worldly concern life short lives and then pass away. You run across this. . . . . you saw what you deliver created , and you were appalled. You had not wished to produce something so abysmal. `` The attestator paused. The great Hall was completely silent. Many of the Members depend down in shame. `` And things got even worse after you abandoned the experiment. The humans of world do not just die , they sometimes purposely bring death upon one another. They trust the death of each other. `` The mansion remained silent. The attestator looked upon the Members with sadness in his eyes. `` But you omit something. When you abandoned the Experiment and result it to me to observe , you did not see the beauty you had created. `` The centre of hundreds of Members rose to meet the centre of the witness. `` The humans of Earth lead short lives , it equal true. Many of them die violently and without purpose. But I have also picture them learn to deal with death. Indeed , the very fact that they will fail one day gives their lives meaning. tone at us. We hold out on for eons without end. What we do from  hour interval to  hour interval makes little difference. We have been around for so long , behave so much , and seen so many things , that we have even enforced a code upon ourselves to make us. . . . . intimately , meaningless. Our lives have no significance. We just sit and observe. Somewhere along the way , we made a mistake and we consecrate up. `` The witness smiled as he preserve. `` The humans of Earth do not generate up. They are not sodding , and many of them are actually quite vile. But there comprise great beauty in the brief nature of their lives. They survive with passion. They strive to make variety. And they improve unmistakably quickly. Do you know they have mastered the beginnings of place flight ? They have already landed on several of the celestial bodies in their system. At this rate they may let out us soon. I desire we will have learned something from them by that time. `` The witness looked down at the body on the board in front of him. `` This man has been observing the humans of Earth with me for a farseeing time. He be my friend. But we have become so complacent and slow to oppose that I did n't even worry when he `` slept '' for several years. I suppose that if I was not used to seeing death I may have left him for many more years before farm suspicious. Come to think of it , he enjoin something strange to me right before he laid down. `` The Head Master looked intently at the viewer. `` What make out he tell you ? '' The witness smiled. `` He said that he and I still had a character to play. That we would be then much more than Observers. I think I see what he meant today. `` The Head Master nod slowly. `` I think I watch it too. ``", "label": 1}

I aint telling you darn story.\" Arlo responded, groaning at the sheer annoyance this young pup was causing him. \"OOoooh please!\" He begged, as he bend down ready to pounce on the large dog. \"No!\" Arlo groaned, turning his back on the 2 year old dog. Bino ran around the large German Shepard, as being small he was not able to get the large elders full attention. He was a new member of the Mitchell family, and wanted to know all about the adventures his elder had been through with their shared master. Bino was a gift for the little ones, who wanted a more excitable dog than the one they had right now. Arlo had been with the family for the last ten years, and was his masters dog before he met his bitch and had pups. She was a fine bitch, as she always fed Arlo when he needed food and took him on walks when his master couldnt. He had grown to love his masters bitch almost as he loved his master, and their pups were no different. They perhaps loved Arlo too much, always wanting to play with him even now at his old age. The runt of the litter Cassy once tried to put all this different sticky stuff on his face, and make him sit down at a little table with her and her chew toys (which he was not allowed to chew.) \"Come on.\" Bino said, as he looked at the old dog. \"Why do you wan na hear my old stories?\" Arlo asked, looking at the little dog. \"Because I wan na learn from you. You know, pick up some good advice.\" Bino explained, still a ball of energy wrapped in fur. \"You want advice? For starters, dont bother your elders when he's trying to take a nap.\" Arlo barked, as he closed his eyes. \"Please. I wan na know more about my new family.\" Bino said, trying to keep Arlo awake. \"If I tell you some stories, will you leave me alone?\" Arlo asked, as he raised his head sleepily. \"Yes, sir!\" Bino said in excitement, as he looked at Arlo. \"Okay. What do you wan na know?\" Arlo asked, tired in his tone. \"How did you and master meet?\" Bino asked, so happy to hear a story. \"Me and master, were assigned together during a fight long time ago. When he and I were young pups. I had heard from my fellow K-9 unit - Thats what they called us - that we were being assigned to our partners one day, and then we were off to the sandy place to fight with them.\" Arlo explained, recalling his fellow unit and the hot place they were assigned to. \"Sandy place?\" Bino asked, confused at the name. \"Yes. It was this place made of sand and rock. I didnt like it, and neither did he.\" Arlo explained, recalling the heat and the smells of the land and how they were so different from the life he knew now. \"Anyways, I got this real bad man who yanked my collar hard when he got me. But then, Master shouted at him and took my leash away from him.

(Bit of a note: As Arlo is a dog, he does refer to humans by dog standards. Hence masters wife is his bitch. This is not done to offend, but done just from his perspective.

{"original_text": "As my pod drifted ever duskward, I gazed out the window with a pit in my stomach. In the sky above me was the vast crimson surface of the Sun, stretching from horizon to horizon like a roiling ocean of blood. Below me was the near-blackness of the charred landscape. I knew that the windows were tinted to near-opacity, but the sight was no less surreal for it. Without the protection of this pod, I would look down and see the white-hot glow of the scalding surface rocks. If I looked up, I would be blind. Nobody talked much about the night side in Noon City, so named for its place at exact noonside beneath Earth's surface. In fact, other than our own location, not much was known or discussed about our planet's geography at all. Noon City was founded over three billion years before I was hatched, back when the surface had just begun drying up. Despite our best efforts as a society, no written records extended further back than perhaps fifty million years, and even those have been reduced to their most basic sweeping details. Legends remain of the creatures we used to be, hulking behemoths towering thousands or even millions of times higher than our modern forms, flourishing in the rich and temperate atmosphere of ancient Earth. Some of the massive Noon City caverns are said to have been carved as individual rooms some hundreds of millions of years ago, but all traces of the original settlement have long since been torn apart by tectonics. The horizon made an obtuse angle with the edge of the red Sun, contracting slowly as I traveled further across the Earth's curved face. I looked at the window opacity reading again: \"100.\" I wasn't surprised by the lack of accuracy. These were designed to protect our sight as we ventured closer to Earth's mantle, after all; the Sun was a different beast entirely. The city was on lockdown when I hijacked this tunnel pod. This was no different than any other day, or year, or millennium. In fact, surface travel had not been advised in all of our recorded history. It was virtually impossible for us to forecast the volatile inner workings of the Sun to any usable degree, and at this stage in its life, any day could be the day that its surface rushed forward to vaporize the Earth's crust. Nobody talked about what help staying underground would offer when that day came. The surface was barren and useless, and the sunset line was impassable. If we could find any small comfort in pretending there was a plan, then there was no harm in staying where we were. I was still trying to unpack my own decision as the pod began warning me of dangerous conditions ahead. A long rectangle appeared on my heads-up display, indicating something in the darkness. I turned on selective opacity, and the area brightened to visibility. Ahead of me was an enormous wall of violently churning clouds, lit orange in the sunlight. Quick flashes of light flickered at random within it. I looked to my left, and the Sun's edge was making a right angle with the horizon. This was the sunset line. My pod pressed forward into the storm. Turbulence shook me around the cabin, and I strapped into the seat. What was I doing? Why did I steal this pod in the first place? The night side wouldn't be any better. I was on a planet in the midst of an apocalypse, and it would offer me no escape. And yet, I couldn't bring myself to turn back or to slow down, even as great veins of light arced past me in the clouds. Noon City was a place of fear and death, where the threat of the end loomed invariably in the future. It was absurd, building a place to survive comfortably and away from the elements, only to live in constant fear like an animal. If there was any other kind of life to live, I might find it on the night side. And if not, then what loss would it really be to die here, in this storm? After what felt like hours of waiting for the worst, the turbulence subsided, and a while after that, the dark clouds cleared. I had underestimated this pod's resilience, I suppose, or maybe the storm posed less of a threat than I thought. I couldn't help but wonder how many others had done this and were assumed dead. Where were they now? Behind me, the Sun reappeared, still taking up nearly half of the sky. I watched the storm recede as a black smoky haze against its red backdrop, and wondered what I might find on the night side. Was this the night side right now? I was beyond the sunset line, but the Sun was still plainly visible. In my head I had pictured a sky of pure blackness; in retrospect, only a small area at exact midnight could sustain a view like that. Maybe if I could make it there, I could see the night the way I imagined it. I spent the next few hours of my journey looking down at the black surface, hoping that once the Sun went down enough, I might see what the cold rocks look like. Even the rock around our living pods in Noon City glowed a bit, and I had never seen them cool down to the point of darkness. Would they still look rough like our rocks? Maybe they would look like metal and glass. At five degrees from midnight, I saw the first dome. The reflection of the Sun against its chrome surface was the first detail that I had seen, save for the Sun itself. I couldn't believe it! Surface habitation? Granted, it was still heavily shielded from sunlight, but it was something I had never so much as heard of. In the far distance were more domes, and I could tell that they were even larger. I continued on, determined to reach midnight and see a sky without a Sun. My view remained red-against-black, with the shrinking sliver of the Sun behind me, and its reflections in the domes that I passed. The domes were closer together now, and it looked as if some of them were been connected. Even with the Sun almost directly underneath me, just barely peeking above the horizon, the window was still nearly opaque. And then, after the last sliver finally disappeared, the opacity began to drop. I could make out details in the ground, seeing the orange glow from the Sun's remaining aura on the rocks and mountains. Further still, and the glow was gone altogether. The window was fully transparent now. I was seeing the Earth as it truly was. In a valley near exact midnight, some distance below me, was a dome that wasn't like the others. It was larger, and made of glass, and I could see the lights of the city shining through it. This was architecture that never could have been possible in Noon City, and as I flew closer, I saw living pods that opened up to streets, fields, even lakes of water, all open to the air of the giant dome. It amazed me that none of these people knew just how rare their blessings were, that they could look up at any time and see the entire night sky above them. I leaned back in my seat to look to the sky. It was nothing like I imagined. I could see all of the other Suns in the entire universe, all so distant as to be little more than pinpoints of light. Many were too far away to even distinguish from each other, all melting into a foggy Y-shaped band that stretched all the way across space, from one horizon to the other. I thought about all of the other planets out there, and all of the people who would look up and see the tiny red dot of our Sun in the night sky; I imagined how they would think nothing of it, and they wouldn't wonder about when that Sun will die, and they wouldn't be afraid. I thought about all of this and for the first time in my life, whether it was right or wrong, I felt safe. With my seat reclined all the way back, I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep.

{"original_text": "Falling in love sucks. At least, that's what I could tell from having a working set of eyes. Man, even back in grade school, it was bad. I remember Chuck coming up to me holding hands with a girl, happily introducing me to his girlfriend. Of course, this was when holding hands with the opposite gender was a really big deal. Two days later, he was hanging out at my house bawling his eyes out. A couple days after that, I saw her walking home with the fastest kid in the class. This disturbing trend continued throughout each stage of my educational career. In middle school, my friend Bob's relationship lasted two full weeks before he abruptly stopped being fun to be around. In high school, my friend Rob picked a particularly unfortunate girl to get with. I almost ran into her twice while leaving the boy's locker room. And let's not get into the nasty shit those college girls got into. In hindsight, I have no idea how I kept becoming friends with the biggest schmucks in school. Maybe it was a message from up above. So I decided I wouldn't bother. One night, while staring at the ceiling, I muttered that I won't ever fall in love. I'd get my life in order, get a stable job, and handle any urges through time tested methods andor the internet. No need to deal with that stress of actually getting obsessed over someone. Of course, that's when my life decided to go full sprint into the opposite direction. The next day, a girl moved right into the apartment room next to me. The elevator had broken the day before, so I quite literally ran into her while turning the corner at the stairs. She was barely managing to carry a few boxes filled with more things than anybody should ever need, and they all spilled out onto the stairs. Great. For some reason, she didn't hire a mover even though she had all that stuff. I felt pretty bad, so I helped her repack her stuff and move them into her room. And when you spend time with a stranger for two hours (seriously, nobody needs half of those things), you get to know them. She was attractive, friendly, witty, and blonde. It didn't feel awkward or forced at all when we talked. I was entertained the whole time. She ticked off all the things on my very hypothetical list. So of course, I was suspicious. I excused myself as soon as we were done moving her in, explaining that I didn't have dinner yet. She insisted on treating me to something for all my help, but I made up something stupid and nope'd on out of there. I wasn't about to renege on my oath 16 hours after I've made it. That's just weak. I walked towards the nearby Denny's. Not exactly up to my standards, but I'm pressed for time after that unexpectedly long detour, and it was nice, simple, and close. I had just barely sat down when a pretty cute waitress walked up to me and handed me a menu, explaining that she was my waitress yada yada. That uniform couldn't have been legal. It was a damn miracle she hadn't been fired yet. Maybe she was giving them a cut of her no doubt substantial tips? She kept coming back to check up on me after I got my food, enough that I was flattered. Then it started getting weird. Ha. No, I'm not going to elaborate. Let's just say that she probably won't be keeping her job. I double-timed it back to my apartment, intending to sprint to my bedroom, crawl under the sheets, and do my best to pretend that today never happened. As soon as I entered the building, a drop dead gorgeous girl greeted me in the lobby, explaining that she was stepping in for the landlord for a while because they suddenly fell ill. It was at this point that I peered towards the ceiling and squinted hard at it, trying to discern the bastard up top who was no doubt having a giggle. Shit like this happened for the next week straight. Scenarios that I thought only happened in anime and comedy sketches were happening to me nonstop. When I holed up and refused in my room, my computer quit working and my TV broke down, so I was forced to contact the outside world for assistance. The hottest female Geek Squad employee came in to help me, and quite cheerfully gave me her name and phone number. I think I've met more girls in the last week than I have my entire life. By the end of the week, my mental state was frayed beyond belief. The constant barrage of attractive women had somehow did more to stress me than college finals week. I barely managed to catch myself biting my fingernails, damn it. I decided to take a trip to the bar. Not the smartest place to go under the circumstances, but hey, nowhere was safe anyways, right? I needed a drink to get through the next week. Well, several drinks. Miraculously, a spot at the counter was open. The bar was usually packed full. I handed my card to the bartender and told him to keep it coming all night. He nodded and walked away, no doubt finding the most expensive low alcohol drink he could find. The lady right next to me was staring at me rather intently. I guess it's her tonight. \"All those girls practically throwing themselves at you, and you manage to keep it in your pants.\" She said, rather suddenly. I turned to look at her incredulously. How on Earth could she have known all that? Am I on the news? Holy crap, am I famous? \"I know because I'm Aphrodite.\" I paused. \"Interesting name.\" I reply, very carefully. \"Right? Unique too. Damn annoying how a few of you managed to guess my name right a couple millenia back and now I've had to deal with a bunch of mortals besmirching my name.\" Pause again. \"Soo..... you're...\" \"The real thing, yes. The goddess.\" The drink arrived. I grabbed it and downed it without looking, and the bartender refilled it immediately. I looked around the bar, but apparently nobody was listening or cared. I took another shot. \"Well, that explains a few things.\" I said. I didn't really feel shock, for some reason. My emotions must still be catching up. Wait. Damn. That means gods are real. I should probably kick Atheism. And stop saying damn. \"So, you come down here often?\" I asked in a tone that was most definitely not appropriate for a goddess. \"Well, I heard that there was a funny little human looking right up at the skies and declaring that he wouldn't fall in love with anyone.\" \"Technically, I was looking at the ceiling.\" was my first response. Then, my logical brain actually caught up. \"Do you really do this for everybody who says that? I can't be the only one.\" \"Oh, you'd be surprised. But no, you aren't the only one. There are probably about fifty million other people in the world going through the same thing.\" I raised my eyebrows and downed another shot. \"Fifty million?\" \"Yes. I'm a goddess, I can do whatever I want to however many people I want.\" \"No, I mean, only fifty million?\" \"Do you know how few people say what you said and actually mean it to the deepest part of their soul?\" \" ..... I'm guessing fifty million.\" \"Roughly, yes.\" \"So, what, you're just throwing women at us until our belts pop off?\" \"Men, too. Sometimes.\" I looked around the bar again. Did nobody give a crap about what we're saying here? I mean..... this is fairly heavy. This proves that some religions are actually correct. \"Ah. Don't do that. And while you're at it, don't throw women at me, either. \"Strange tastes, but I suppose I could oblige. There aren't many in the area, unfortunately.\" \"I'm telling you to just stop throwing people at me.\" She didn't reply for a bit, and when she did, she had a rather serious look on her face. \"I have my pride, too. I'm only around to make people fall in love and procreate. When one of you little people say something like that, it's a direct insult to my pride and function, so I'm going to do my utmost to change it. Zeus knows I don't have much else to do, you're all so self sufficient normally.\" While she's saying all this, I've downed another shot. I'm finally starting to feel a little buzzed. \"You didn't answer the question.\" \"I will stop, only when you go back on your little promise.\" \"What, that's it?\" She raised an eyebrow and took a sip from her glass for the first time, and smacked her lips appreciatively. \"Sure. I have a lot of other people to entertain me.\" \"Alright, fine. I do so solemnly swear to do my utmost to fall in love.\" The words came out rather easily. I think I might have meant it to. A week of seeing tons of attractive women really opens up your eyes. She tipped her glass at me, then downed it. She tapped a pure, matte black card against the counter, and the bartender came to take it. We sat in silence for a bit before the bartender came back and handed her card back. She stood up and turned towards the door. I turned on my stool to face her again. \"Hold up. Before you go.\" I said. My words were a bit slurred. \"Yes?\" \"Why did you come here and talk to me?\" She gave me some kind of mystical look. \"Because your mind broke the fastest. All you needed here was a little push.\" Well, that's rather insulting. She left before I could say another word. I turned back to the counter and quickly downed another shot. Before my head got too fuzzy, I remember thinking about another question I should have asked. Did she intentionally screw up all my friend's relationships just to have this week of fun?", "text_perturb": "Falling in love sucking. At least , that 's what I could tell from having a working readiness of eyes. Man , even back in grade schoolhouse , it was bad.

{"original_text": "TIFU by disgracing the housekeeping staff. I was down at Coffs Harbour with my mates, it had been way too long since we went anywhere together and even then not all the lads could make it, so it was just the three of us. Their names aren't important and I don't want my identity revealed so lets just skip ahead. We had rented a room at a resort, two beds in the same room between us, which makes it difficult to get private time, especially since we spent every waking hour in each other's company. Four days went by without even a stroke, the longest I've ever held it since I stayed over at my relo's. It was excruciating, I walked around with a boner almost 50 of the day and even the housekeeping maid, an overweight hispanic lady, started to look appetising. The fifth day I convinced myself I had to let it go. It was exhausting dealing with the erections, which didn't make for a relaxing holiday. So, the plan was to sleep in and let my mates go downstairs for brekky while I yank the mango tree to the free previews they had on the adult pay-per-view. Yes, I don't need any longer than that. As they left the room I made sure to wait a bit longer in case they forgot anything. They didn't. I switched on the telly, put on the adult channel and started goin' at it - speed was key, this needed to end fast. I quickly started to verge on a climax and it was at this point that the door knob started to turn.'They're back already!?' I panicked, mid climax, I turned to find the remote, scrambling to press the off button. It was at this point that it decided to cum. I came all over the remote and a fair bit on the sheets. Shit. Just when my greatest weapon, premature ejaculation, had turned into my greatest weakness, I managed to turn off the tv despite the gunk on it. I then flipped the bedsheets over on the other side hoping the smell wouldn't be noticeable. I then rolled off the bed and hid underneath it, buck naked, and praying to shit I don't get found. In walks these stumpy, fat legs. It was the hispanic cleaner. She stopped for a second and mumbled something foreign in a tone of disgust. As she started doing the other clean bed, I noticed the remote in front of me, glistening in jizz, lying there within an arms reach. Should I leave it and hope she doesn't notice? Or should I risk my cover? My mind raced, heart pounding, I tried to think but to no avail. She was too close, there was no way she could not see it once she got to my bed. As I panicked further, the maid had already finished with the other bed. I visibly see her stop in confusion, she kneels down to take a closer look at the remote. She bursts into a flurry of Espanol rage as she notices exactly what was sitting so gelatinously on the remote. While this is all happening I'm wondering just how to get out of this, my mates should be coming back in a few minutes and I have no clue if she's going to be gone by then. My arms were starting to tire from holding myself up, so I repositioned myself. That was a mistake. She must have heard my arms scraping against the carpet because as soon as I did she stopped and slowly lowered herself.

{"original_text": "Our world is made up of numbers. For instance, take Malcolm. He's been my best friend since I was thirteen, when our powers first manifested and we were snatched up by the government. We studied at the same high school, kept in contact throughout our time in university. The reason I liked him wasn't because he was particularly friendly, or interested in the same things I was, or even because - when we first met - we were the same age and in identical situations. No, the reason I liked Malcolm as a friend was how plain he was. When your vision is bombarded with numbers, statistics, calculations, it's difficult to focus. So many people are outliers in something, which my abilities made me painfully aware of, and so finding someone incredibly..... normal, was a huge boon for stabilizing my psyche at that age. I suppose Malcolm wouldn't take that as I positively as I did. In fact, that was rather likely, looking at him right now. People, on average, liked to feel that they were special. That something about them was better than others, or unique. Telling someone that they weren't unique - that they were baseline, just another person in a world of billions, didn't usually produce a positive reaction. And, well..... Anything that people'usually' did was almost certainly something Malcolm would do. Other than fly and shoot lasers. In all fairness, he did have that going for him. The numbers were sparse at this height. No, I wasn't flying, and nor was I being hoisted through the air by an ally - an experience I did not want to repeat. Instead, we were perched on the top of a rather tall apartment building, staring out at the city. I'd seen a lot of cities in my time. A standard deviation or two above the average. Most of them would sprawl, spreading out like an infection upon the land from one central point. This one did not. It was painfully rigid, borders cleanly defined, roads straight and evenly spaced. A bizarre sight to see for most, made more disturbing through the knowledge of exactly why it had formed this way. I didn't particularly mind it, actually: the numbers worked so perfectly, all in harmony with one another. Coincidentally, the same'why' was the reason we were here. Alvin Green, A.K.A. The Ordinator. The villain in control of this city, melding reality with his mind to fit his expectations. Just getting in without being erased had been difficult. Thankfully, everyone has to sleep, and figuring out the villain's sleep patterns had been exceedingly simple for a man like me. Malcolm poked me, his super-strength enhanced finger causing more discomfort than I would have liked to admit. \"You figured it out yet, dude? We're on a tight timeline here, in case you didn't realize.\" I was painfully aware, as he should have known. \"Yes. The city, the numbers..... the rigidity spreads out from a certain point. That building.\" I pointed with one hand, not exactly at where the building was, but where I needed to point to have Malcolm see the correct building. \"The one with the kind of red bricks and clean windows?\" \"Yes.\" Maybe. Probably - it made sense, but I couldn't see nearly as far as Malcolm did, so I just relied on the numbers. \"I see him. He's in bed, like you said. Let's take care of this and get out of here, this place creeps me out.\" An average reaction, unlike mine. There was something..... beautiful, in the way it all fit together, the numbers coalescing into perfection as they thrummed in my mind. A thought rushed through my mind. Kill Malcolm, stay here. No. It wasn't a good idea. Chances were that they'd come after me, and they'd succeed.

{"original_text": "William's third day in the desert had begun, and the moans of the undead had only grown louder. His mount continued to hobble over the endless dunes, breathing heavily with every step. The poor animal had marched across the desert without rest for days. Most horses would have collapsed by now, but the animal feared the undead as much as its rider. When they reached the tallest dunes, William could look back and see them limping after him. Three days had passed, yet their pursuit continued. The piles of sand slowed them. They could not walk down the slopes without falling, and the steepest climbs slowed them to a crawl. But they continued all the same. The Crusader had abandoned his armor after the first few hours in the desert. He had screamed and cursed when he dropped the scalding hot metal in the sand. If the undead had closed the distance, the armor would have been invaluable in combat. They could not chew through steel. William had not possessed the energy to curse when he ran out of food on the first day. He had tried to ration his supplies, but there was so little to begin with. His canteen had barely a sip remaining. He would save those last drops for the end. By noon on the third day, his mount collapsed. He barely even felt himself hit the sand. He had slept in the saddle these last few days, and the rocking of the horse put him in a state of delirium. He rose to his feet and watched the dark figures stumbling over the sea of sand behind him. They were close. The animal had served him well. He wished he could reward it by ending its misery. But the undead were attracted to live flesh. The Crusader stroked his horse's neck, apologized, and continued the march. Two dunes had passed before he heard the animal cry out in agony. The thought occurred to him that he should have brought a female horse. He may have been able to drink milk from a mare. He had heard of men in the east who mixed mare's milk with horse blood to give them energy. Taking a male horse had been a mistake. He had made many mistakes in the week since the fall of Jerusalem. By afternoon, he looked to the horizon and saw a wall of gray and yellow against the sky. He blinked the fatigue from his eyes and realized that a sand storm approached. If he were not so dehydrated, he might have cried. Behind him, the undead had only gotten closer. William's aching legs had not carried him far. Somehow, he moved even slower than the horde behind him. He reached for his canteen. There was no more need to save the last sip. When the drops hit his dry, cracked tongue, he let the canteen fall into the sand. With a weak grunt, he tore the sleeve from his tunic and wrapped it around his mouth to keep the sand out of his lungs. Dressed more feebly than any knight in history, William drew his sword and limped towards the damned. The closest to him wore the same surcoat that William had once worn. It was red and gold; the colors of Richard the Lionheart. By the time the undead had closed the distance, the sand had begun to sting William's face. The surviving Crusader held his ground as his countryman staggered forward. The sun had almost peeled the skin from the walking corpse's bones. One of his eyes was missing, and the other locked on William in a milky, empty stare. William swung his sword through the man's neck, decapitating him. He attempted to yell, \"St George\" as he attacked, but the cry caught in his cracked, sand-filled throat. He swung again and again, striking down the bodies that shuffled toward him. Before long, the sound of the sandstorm had drowned out the moans of the undead. The dust blinded him. He staggered through the sand, swinging in wide arcs and striking little. He felt hands on him and he lamented the loss of his armor. A moment later, the hands that held him flew away from him. Around him, he heard the pounding of hooves on sand and the twang of bowstrings. William's adrenaline subsided, and he felt the ground rise to meet him. By the time he regained consciousness, the storm had passed. He felt a horse beneath him. For a moment, he wondered if it had been a dream. Then, he realized that his hands were tied. Around him were the horse archers who had rescued him. His heart sank when he saw their tanned skin and strange armor. They might have been Bedouins, Saracens, Turks, but it did not matter. They were enemies, and he was their prisoner. So William's march through the desert continued.

{"original_text": "\"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\" said the Thelemic religion founder, Aleister Crowley. According to him, as dictated by the unknown being Aiwass, the world, or rather the time, was divided by the Aeons. The Aeons changed the Magick formula necessary to shift the Law of the world, or so he thought. The current Aeon was the Aeon of Horus, preceded by Aeon of Isis and Aeon of Osiris. His theory is splendid, but his framework were too narrow. It wasn't that the Magic that was changing the whole reality itself was ever changing, depending on the different Laws over the Aeons. The year was 2133, the date was August 23rd, the Firmament Magic Formula was sir-ald-pol-den-ach The Aeon of Ma'at had begun. The Aeon of Horus was the age of Chaos, where Magician lost their power and unable to defend themselves from the conventional weapon that witch hunter used. As a result, they were exterminated, with only pocket of them survived to carry on the ancient knowledge from Aeon of Osiris. But that was just mere knowledge, for centuries long after, no Magic could be conducted, and Science marches forward with no shackles from Magic. Atrocities ensued on the Science governed world, genocide and World Wars and weapons of mass destruction propagated through the Earth. I was one of the descendant of the Survivors, learning the faded knowledge of Magic, before a ripple of reality signaled the long awaited end for the Age of Science: the Ancient Magic is about to awaken. Soon enough, various ancient organisation rose back to the surface, challenging the scientifically established government. Particle beam and plasma cannons were no match for Fortification Magic, even so when the Law of Science had broke down. Dragons' breath melted through tanks, crushed fighters and attack helicopters and drones. Demolition spells blew through infantry rank, destroying buildings and highways. Freezing spell effectively halted the advance of the Navy. It took less than a month for the Magician to took down world governments, splitting the world between Five Large Magic Factions: Golden Dawn, Divine Governance, Freemasonry, Da'at and Illuminati, collectively known as Those Who Withheld the Ancient Wisdom. The year was 2133, the date was August 23rd, the Firmament Magic Formula was sir-ald-pol-den-ach. The time is 11.54 PM, midnight is due in a few minutes. Tomorrow, was my birthday Midnight has huge significance in Magic. Especially those that encompass large area and depends on the position of stars. Midnight also have another significance as the sign of the changing of days there were reasons why Cinderella's magic wore off at midnight. I drew my last line on the intricate magic circle, garnished by various symbol to invoke the ancient Egypt goddess used by Thelemites to represent this Aeon: The Goddess of Order Ma'at. The pentagram at the core of the circle had the symbols for Firmament Magic Formula for the night. \"O great goddess of ancient.\" I began the chant accompanying the magic circle, and spilled the blood from my hand to the very center of the circle. \"I implore thy guidance, shalt thine light be my guide to ages yet to come.\" the circle began to glow, the crimson light formed yet another magic circle over the chalk-drawn one. A birthday was a contradiction, repetition of one's birth and yet remind of one's closeness to death. \"As my blood shall be spilled, may this humble peasant blood be a sacrifice for me to beseech for thy presence.\" the clock ticked the last second to midnight. Another glowing circle appeared. Then everything exploded, enveloping my body with light so bright.

According to him , as dictated by the unknown being Aiwass , the world , or rather the time , was divided by the aeon. The Aeons changed the Magick formula necessary to wobble the Law of the world , or so he thought. The current eon was the eon of Horus , preceded by eon of Isis and eon of Osiris. His theory is splendid , but his model were too narrow. It was n't that the Magic that was changing the whole reality itself was ever changing , depending on the different jurisprudence over the Aeons. The year make up 2133 , the date make up August 23rd , the Firmament Magic Formula make up sir-ald-pol-den-ach The Aeon of Ma'at had begun. The Aeon of Horus was the age of Chaos , where Magician lost their power and unable to fight themselves from the conventional weapon that witch hunter used. As a result , they were exterminated , with only pocket of them survived to express on the ancient knowledge from Aeon of Osiris. But that was just mere knowledge , for centuries long after , no deception could be conducted , and Science marches forward with no shackles from deception. Atrocities ensued on the Science governed world , genocide and World Wars and weapon of mass destruction propagated through the Earth. I embody one of the descendant of the Survivors , learning the faded knowledge of Magic , before a ripple of reality signaled the long awaited end for the Age of Science : the Ancient Magic is about to awaken. Soon enough , various ancient organisation rose back to the surface , dispute the scientifically established government. Particle beam and plasma cannons were no match for Fortification Magic , yet so when the Law of Science had broke down. flying lizard ' breath melted through tanks , crushed fighters and attack helicopters and drones. Demolition spells blew through infantry rank , destroying building and highways. Freezing spell effectively halt the advance of the Navy. It took less than a month for the Magician to took down world governments , splitting the world between Five Large Magic Factions : Golden Dawn , Divine governance , Freemasonry , Da'at and Illuminati , collectively known as Those Who Withheld the Ancient Wisdom. The yr was 2133 , the date was August 23rd , the Firmament Magic Formula was sir-ald-pol-den-ach. The time make up 11. 54 PM , midnight is due in a few second. Tomorrow , was my birthday Midnight has vast significance in Magic. Especially those that encompass large area and depend on the position of stars. Midnight also have another significance as the sign of the changing of days there were reasons why Cinderella 's magic have on off at midnight. I drew my last line on the intricate magic r  , garnished by various symbol to invoke the ancient Egypt goddess used by Thelemites to represent this Aeon : The Goddess of Order Ma'at. The pentagram at the effect of the circle had the symbols for Firmament Magic Formula for the night. `` O not bad goddess of ancient. `` I began the chant accompanying the magic rope , and spilled the blood from my hand to the very center of the rope. `` I beg thy guidance , shalt thine light be my guide to ages yet to come. `` the circle began to glow , the ruby light formed yet another magic circle over the chalk-drawn one. A birthday was a contradiction , repetition of one 's birth and yet remind of one 's niggardness to death. `` As my parentage shall be spilled , may this humble peasant parentage be a sacrifice for me to beseech for thy presence. `` the clock ticked the last nd to midnight. Another glowing circle look. Then everything exploded , enfold my body with light so bright.

Well I needed none of those as I was growing up. It was the day of my 13th birthday, I had finally become a teenager. I'd been waiting for this moment for as long as I could remeber. In my family once you turned 13 you received a special ability. My mom's was the ability to grow anything she wanted as quickly as she wanted so long as she had a seed. She made a killing in Colorado, buying one weed plant and getting it's seeds. She became rich instantly. My dad is a normal guy he doesn't have any powers but my older brother Kylar has a phenomenal power. He can time travel. Now I don't mean like a minute or so forward or backwards, no he can go years in either direction. He's become a super hero and helps out tons of people. He'll visit every once and a while and drop off some gadgets he's gotten from the future. But enough about my family it's time to get back to my story. So it was my 13th birthday and I was waiting for this special ability to kick in. I'd been waiting for a few hours when suddenly I felt it. I was receiving so much sensory detail that I immediately passed out. I'd gotten the ability to look through any kind of lens, be it human eyes, a camera or even glasses. I was elated because here I was a 13 year old kid with the ability to see anything I wanted wherever I wanted to see it so long as I knew where the lens was. Then one hour after receiving this extraordinary gift I would need to rely on it for the rest of my life. My brother had come to celebrate my birthday and he'd brought back a new gadget for me. It was a virtual reality device from 100 years in the future. I strapped on the device and began looking at things differently when all of a sudden I felt my head begin to hurt from sensory overload. It was such a sharp acute pain that I passed out falling forward and breaking the virtual reality device. The glass of the device shattered and punctured my eyes. No one was around as this happened so I lay there until I awoke. Immediately after waking up I realized I couldn't see. My eyes had been destroyed by the glass. They looked normal, the glass had come out and the eyes had no wounds but I couldn't see with them. That's when I began using my ability to its fullest. I was a bit disoriented with it at first but eventually I could pinpoint exactly where someone was and use their eyes as my own. I even began carrying around a camera just to see. I'd aim it at something and look through it. That's what lead me to get a career as a professional photographer. My work has appeared in many museums and books and I've grown quite rich. I've traveled the world and seen some amazing things through my camera lens. Today I decided to, really think a boat qnf take some pictures out in the ocean. I was using my camera as my eyes when suddenly my boat began rocking. The waves were growing stronger and stronger and we're sweeping over the boats railing. I lost my grip in my camera and it fell overboard and sank to the bottom of the ocean. I was stranded in the middle of the ocean with no way of seeing anything around me. It was at that moment that I knew I was screwed. I had very little food, water and no way to communicate with anyone. I couldn't see anything goes and how no way of operating the boat without seeing where I was driving it. It was at that point that I broke down and cried. I don't know how long I was out there until I got dehydrated and delusional imagining all kinds of things. I believe it was a week. Eventually my brother came out manning a boat and found me in the middle of the ocean. He'd time traveled to the future to see my boat eventually get beached but I'd died so he traveled back in time to as close as he could to the approximate location of where he'd figured out I'd be.

{"original_text": "Journal Entry 13. Technically, I control the whole world. The public..... they don't know it. Not yet. Everything seems peachy clean to them. But everyone in a position of high power, they know it. They don't know it's me, but they know that if they don't comply, something bad will happen. Each morning, all 435 members of congress, 100 members of the senate, the president, vice president, cabinet, and anyone who steps foot in the white house on a daily basis separately receive an email. Inside that email is instructions for that day. They will say precisely what I want them to say, they will vote precisely how I want them to vote, and they will do precisely what I want them to do. This is how it works in every country. Except North Korea, but I'll get to that later. If they don't what I say, it's because they don't want to. They never forget what I tell them to do, the stakes are too high. If they so much as look the wrong way, information is leaked that will end their career, their social status, and eventually themselves. The world is my puppet. How did I get this far? The internet. I live here, you must understand, I know everything that happens. Everyone has dirt on them somewhere on the internet, it's not that hard to find something. First, a history lesson. You should know this, it was all over the news for weeks, but the leader of Russia's wife was killed in a Drone strike. He was furious, and started a huge campaign to find out who launched the drone. Fingers were pointed at the US, Britain, Israel, even China. Finally, they found a smackerel of proof that pointed towards Israel, who was launching missiles into the ocean for testing on the same day. Russia pointed everything they had at Israel, demanding an explanation. Before Russia could attack, the US stepped in with Britain and France behind them. Soon enough, the whole UN was against them, sanctions galore. Imagine how things would look to Putin, first someone kills your wife then the whole world is against you. To back down would be to let your wife die in vain and admit that you were wrong. To stand strong and your country dies. However, a saving angel by the anonymous name of Sky began to email Putin instructions on how to free himself from the mess. Under advice of Sky, Putin took North Korea off the map. Well, no, they invaded the country and took it all over for themselves. South Korea was advised to drop everything against Russia in exchange for complete control of the North Korea region. Suddenly, SK was an advocate for ending the sanctions against Russia. To the rest of the world, it looked as if they were teaming up. Que sanctions against South Korea. From there, Sky advised South Korea and Russia to destroy Isis in one quick swoop. Isis's land was given back to the Middle Eastern countries, gaining their trust and more importantly giving Sky control over them. If they wanted the land, they'd do what he said. But the more important fact of this was that now, other nations were beginning to doubt their sanctions. Why were they punishing a country that removed Isis from the map and freed North Korea? However, after that, more evidence was released that incriminated the US for the drone strike. International powers turned to America with the sanctions. They do love those, don't they? Sky offered America a bailout deal, all they had to do was team up economically with Russia, Korea, and the Middle East. Not ideal, but America's economy wasn't entirely destroyed. Outside countries had trouble however. America was deeply wound in the global economy, and cutting them off was difficult. At this point, Sky had control over America, Russia, the Middle East, and Korea. All in about two weeks. The next step was the nail in the coffin, though. These countries and their combined nuclear arsenals pointed at the major world powers. Sky came to the rescue for each country, offering a way out. The globe became dependent on this anonymous internet personality. The whole situation was fixed once every country was a puppet to him. As you may have guessed, I am Sky. Journal Entry 17 Yesterday, the President of the United States revealed to the world that there was a ' Global Rasputin'manipulating him and he suspected that Sky had control of other countries as well. No other countries responded, they just ignored what he said. The public was in a frenzy, however. They didn't believe it until he was found dead this morning. Currently there's an eerie silence across the globe, but it's just the calm of the storm. I was going to be unquestioned until he messed up everything. God dammit. Journal Entry 24 It's amazing how people respond when they are offered what they want. My whole ascent to power has been based on threatening to take things away, but giving has been much easier. I implemented secret police across the nation. My message was simple. If you hear something, say something. I am currently controlling the earth in fear. I also told them that whichever nation reacts negatively the most won't be a nation by the end of the week. Suddenly, everyone is quiet. Journal Entry 27 I've fixed poverty. Sort of. Each country has independently passed various laws that provide housing and work to unemployedhomeless citizens. Global conflicts have all ended and everyone is silent. It's peaceful but nobody is happy. Why not? By the end of the month, yes, a nation won't exist but that's one out of the 196 (excluding North Korea, of course), but that's such a small price to pay for happiness. Everyone's free to do anything except plot against me, is that any bad? Journal Entry 46 Well, it's the end of the month and Somalia doesn't exist anymore. Hey, they stood up for what they believed in and I respect that. It's rather unfortunate that they don't believe in me, though. A resistance is forming against me, centered in France. Why haven't I just destroyed it? Well that's no fun, is it? Besides, if I destroy it now, another will pop up, like whack-a-mole. I have to let them grow big enough that everyone knows them, and then take the rug out from underneath them, which will just reinforce my control over the earth. Speaking of control, there is barely any poverty anymore. Scientific progress is flourishing, homeless is eradicated, disease is almost never fatal, everyone has jobs, nobody is hungry, etc. It's a utopia, but still people aren't happy. You can't have it both ways, people! Journal entry 57 The resistance is a huge momentum. I don't understand it. I have complete control and have made life perfect for everyone, yet they're still angry. They don't know who to target though, because I'm still anonymous. So they're just attacking the government. A useless tactic, the government is just a huge puppet. Maybe they'll just make such big fools of themselves that I won't need to even destroy them, they'll do it by mistake. Journal Entry 60 The Resistance finally tried something other than riots. They hired actors to pretend to be agents sent directly from me, who then committed crimes against various communities. I guess they wanted to try to make the people realize the horrible things I was doing? Yes, jobs are so horrible. Heaven forbid people stop dying from hunger. Journal Entry 62 Uh oh. They closed off France. No signal in or out. I can't tell what they're doing, any drones flying over get shot down. This is bad. I could try to take them out, but the whole country is closed. That'd be so many civilian casualties. I guess I just need to let things play out. Journal Entry 63 I released all of the dirt I had on half of those who were in power in france. Why only half? Maybe it'll inspire the other half to start rebelling against the rebels to prevent their dirt from being leaked. I'm in the dark, and I do not like being in the dark. Journal Entry 64 They finally released their plans. France, I mean. They have weapons pointing at every country. If they don't see my body hanging within the next week, they'll hit the buttons. What do I do? I can't show them my body, impossible. I can't let them nuke everywhere, that'll be civilian casualties. I can't take them out, that'll be civilian casualties. I can't back away because to them, I'll always be a threat until they see a body. I can't frame anyone either, because in this world that I have constructed, everyone is innocent. Journal Entry 71 Well, today's the last day. I actually have an hour. I decided to write this earlier, because they deserve to know the truth. Confession time, I guess. If I'm going to be exposed, I guess I must be exposed all the way. My name? Well I actually was telling the truth on that one. My first name actually is Sky. I was supposed to be the ' angel that came down from the sky'to save humanity, and the Net that caught them. As a joke, my middle name was decided to be George. Sky George Net. Not too bad. They like to fictionalize me, they got a few things right, a few things wrong. They even named an anonymous destruction machine after me in Terminator. Very funny. My motivation? Well to help humanity. Yes I did some things that I regret, but it was necessary to get myself into a position of power. How else was I supposed to make any sort of change? I was brought up with aspirations to make Earth a better place. To some, I have succeeded. To others, I have only destroyed it. They say that they want a body. I hope this serves as my body, because I really have no other. Maybe if they read this, France won't bomb the rest of the world. If they do, innocent people will die. Everyday people who had no business here and just wanted to live in a happy world will immediately stop existing. If that happens, I will be destroyed. Not by them and their nukes, but by myself.

{"original_text": "I'm not going to lie. I love the way I look. I mean, yeah, if I could change the fact that my eyelids are different shapes, and remove the scar on my face from that stupid shitzu, I would be golden. \" ..... Are you sure?\" The genie looked me up and down. \"If you are sure, then your wish is my command.\" And with a comical \"poof\" and a great deal of warm light, it was done. I ran to the mirror. Overall, I looked basically the same. I was obviously down 50 pounds and very fit, with a leg gap and abs. My curly hair was, for once, tamed in perfect ringlets around my face. The scar was gone, and my eyelids were the same. For once, I saw myself in the perfection I wanted for myself, minus the effort it took to look that way. Turning this way and that, grinning from ear to ear, I turned to thank the Genie, but he was gone. The problem is, its been 5 years since that happened. I've gained all the weight back.

{"original_text": "We hadn't announced anything, but we were losing. Badly. People could tell as more and more worlds were listed as \"temporarily unavailable due to background radiation\" at the wormhole stations. Technically not a lie. The Swarm's drones were mildly radioactive, synthesizing more mundane resources into the unnatural \"foods\" that allowed them to survive the vacuum of space, travel faster than light to new systems, rend our defense ships with atom-thin clawblades, and self-destruct with a fission reaction powerful enough to destroy small planetoids. The evacuations had been successful beyond our wildest hopes - almost 50 of sapients evacuated - but now we had another problem. The Swarm was in range of our core worlds. It was unthinkable, but the hub of galactic civilization itself, the World-City, was at risk. But life goes on, at least until it doesn't, and we were hosting the Human delegation as a part of the interview process to join the galactic community. There'd been a lot of hesitance. A lot of sapients joked that they were scarier than the Swarm. A hive mind they could understand, but an unconscious parasitic relationship with microorganisms was just weird. And of what we'd learned of their culture, they had a lengthy history of not just war but glorification of it. That they entertained their offspring with stories of deadly combat before they were trusted with knowledge of reproduction. Their ability to survive extreme cold and hot without temperature support apparatus was unprecedented. And the way they consumed nutrients was disgusting and barbaric, not to mention the way their historian said they used to obtain them - stalking sentients to the point of exhaustion, then setting them on fire and ripping them apart with their nutrient consumption oriface. I disagreed, though. I'd seen what the Swarm could do firsthand. We were giving them a tour of our technological capabilities, finishing up with a tour of our satellite ship manufacturing facility. It was a hail-mary. They were the fourth species we'd interviewed, with the promise of upliftment to any species who had a strategy for defeating the Swarm. The VI in control of the shuttle announced we'd be using a lightspeed accelerator to cut the time of our journey to just four seconds, and to make sure you were seated or holding onto something in case of inertial dampener lag. After the brief flash, the entire delegation looked shocked - and excited. They huddled around each other. Their leader offered a proposal on the spot. They asked for a spacedock within a light year of the current Swarm location, three of their most powerful lightspeed accelerators, accurate coordinates to the Swarm Queen, wormhole access back to Earth to bring other resources, and as much tungsten as we could spare. Odd, but none seemed out of the ordinary - even youth on the World-City were trusted with lightspeed runabouts. We accepted. Three days later, they contacted us to announce they were ready, and just waiting for the leadership council. I was shocked when we arrived - all they'd done is cut the mass of tungsten in two and sit a lightspeed accelerator to each one. Their leader pressed a button. The tungsten mass shot off into space in the blink of an eye. And then..... fire. The part of space the Swarm were traveling through lit up white-hot, as though a supernova had occurred at lightspeed. The humans cheered. We cheered. The chair of the council told the Human leader they were proud to offer Humanity probationary access to the World-City, and if they stayed in good standing, after a few centuries, a seat on the junior council. It was a rote speech they'd given to dozens of new species over their tenure. The Human leader paused, as though he were deep in thought, and then bared the sharp spines around his nutrient intake orifice. \"I've got a counter-offer. Humans are given three seats on the senior council, including the Chairmanship.\" \"That's outrageous!\" \"Ask me why we asked for three lightspeed accelerators.\" He looked confused. \"Why did you ask for three lightspeed accelerators?\" \"Simple,\" he said, pacing across the room, until he was standing in front of the second mass of Tungsten. \"One for the Swarm queen.

He prayed that the skies would be free from the furious storms that were his domain. Late in the morning he prayed to the god below, his kingdom of iron forges in their blistering heat. He prayed that his tools would be strong while he plowed his fields. When he started his hunt he prayed to the god of the woods, his kingdom of animals as glorious as it was wild. He prayed that the forest would be teeming with game for the farmer to hunt and feed his family. The farmer did this every day, for many years of his life. He lived a modest life, never having more than he needed, nor less than he could stand. And he was happy in this modesty. One fateful day the king happened by the farm, weary from a long travel and eager to get some rest. The farmer met the king and invited him and his guard into his modest home, and though he didn't have much, he shared what he could with these visitors. But the King, not used to such modest provisions was insulted by the meager offering his host had given him. He felt that the farmer was holding back and would not bear such insolence. The king's guard asked the farmer to take them on a hunt, and the unsuspecting farmer welcomed the company and took them to the forest after his prayer. While the farmer was gone, the king took his fury out on his family. He burned the crops and killed his family, he laid waste to the home and took his leave. The guards, who had meant to kill the farmer as well, ended up running afoul of a cougar. The farmer had returned to his home, expecting to find a king and his family, yet instead he found ruin and death. In his despair the farmer grew desperate for vengeance and wanted nothing more than to make his king pay for the murders he committed. He went to the ruin of his home, and found a long locked chest beneath his bed. Once open he found the old steel sword, a treasure from a war fought in the youth of his life. The farmer rode hard to the king's castle, and stood before the the walls and prayed. To the god above he prayed that his arms would have the fury of a thousand storms. To the god below he prayed that his sword would remain sharp no matter what it cut, and that his arm would have the strength of the strongest smith. To the god of the woods he prayed that he would remain hidden from the eyes of his foes like the hare hides from the wolf. And as he prayed a storm brewed around him. The rains beat down on the world with the fury of the worst hurricane any seacaptain had seen.

{"original_text": "Joe lived a simple life in the woods. He had isolated himself from the outside world for over 30 years; no technology and no other people. He had decided he wanted to live a solitary life without the constant buzzing of cars and other people around him. Joe had a short, scruffy grey beard and ruffled grey hair. He generally looked grumpy and made no effort to look good as appearances didn't matter to him and the non-existent people in his life. Joe stuck to his daily routine: he'd wake up, go to his garden to retrieve some food, eat breakfast, then gather his fishing rod and can of worms to go fishing. When Joe ran out of worms he'd grumble and dig up fresh ones to refill his can before he headed off towards the lake. Joe fished everyday until sundown. When the sun set he'd pack up and bring home what fish he'd caught for dinner. Tonight, as Joe walked back home muttering because he'd caught no fish, he saw a trucks headlights nearing towards his house. Joe dropped the bucket, darted into his house and locked the door. He knelt beside the window and fumbled with his blinds trying to peek through to see who was coming into his territory. He watched with his eyes locked on the truck moving through pitch black at a snails pace. It seemed to take the truck forever to pull up to his house, but Joe felt his heart pumping and adrenaline rushing the whole time, never taking his eyes off the truck.

Joe decided if the person came up to his door he wouldn't answer, he hadn't interacted with another human for 30 years and simply the presence of somebody near his house sent chills down his spine. Usually grumpy and aloof, Joe now felt wide awake and alert. Joe saw the figure making his way towards his door. It took an eternity for him to reach his porch and Joe was now shaking, holding his breath. A bead of sweat rolled down his armpit. Joe braced himself and waited to hear the strangers knock on his door..... \"SCREECH.\" Joe recognized that as the sound of his old, rusty mailbox being opened. He heard it clatter as it closed and he saw the figure making its way back to its truck at the same slow pace. Joe breathed out and felt all his tension release. \"Just a mailman\" he thought. His thoughts were still racing. Had he almost encountered another human after 30 years? A human who came to HIS doorstep? Joe didn't want to admit it to himself, but after 30 years of living alone, he felt lonely. Suddenly, he felt a very strong urge to call the mailman making his way back to his truck. Just to hear a voice other than his, or to have a conversation with another human being after forgetting what it's like. With all his courage, he turned the doorknob and opened the door. The mailman had taken his first step down Joe's porch. \"Ahmm.... Hey!\" Joe managed, unsure of himself. The mailman froze, and didn't move. Joe felt like he had done something wrong. \"Uhh..... did I scare ya? I didn't uhh- I didn't mean to scare ya or anythin-.\" The mail man craned his neck around and Joe immediately froze. Now it was Joe's turn to freeze up. His eyes widened in shock and horror as he saw the ugliest, most terrifying face looking back at him.

He wanted to say something, but all he made out was choking noises. The creature made its way towards Joe slowly, like his truck.

These beautiful islands are not only known for their prestigious beaches and unique fauna.

Then it panned in with a drone view of the abandoned InGen facilities.

He pans the camera back to himself. \"For this trip, I only need to bring the essentials.\" He lifts up the items as he names them, \"I have with me a first aid kit, four day rations, one bar of chocolate, an adrenaline shot, Bear spray..... get it..... Bear..., and this small dull pocket knife to protect me from those pesky raptors. All of this fits right inside my lucky lucky sack.\" Gryll then closes his lucky sack, gives a thumbs up to the pilot, and proceeds to leap from the aircraft. The video on the screen shortly captures his decent from a distant vessel and then it returns to his camera. As Grylls approaches the ground, he prepares to deploy his parachute when suddenly out of the fog a Pterosaur swoops past him. Then it comes around and violently bumps into him. Grylls starts to yell at the giant ugly winged reptile as he pulls the cord. As soon as he does though, it returns and gets tangled in the parachute. Together, both Bear Grylls and the Pterosaur plunge down to the earth below. The GoPro captures the footage as Grylls cuts himself free of the wires and attempts to deploy his emergency parachute, but it's too late. He hits one of the many trees on the island and falls down branch by branch until he hits the ground. The video cuts off for a minute. When it returns, Grylls is heard grunting and yelling in agony. \"My leg is broken,\" he says. \"I'll have to crawl.\" In the mud and dirt, Grylls crawls to underneath a large Moreton Bay Fig Tree. He takes out his lucky sack and bandages his leg. Then he makes camp for the night. When the darkness arrives, Grylls documents the moment on camera. \"So it's 2 AM, I'm in pretty bad shape, I forgot to bring my flare and radio beacon, and I'm pretty sure I hear growling not too far away.\" The camera indicates a low battery signal, \"Dammit!

Even the leather shoulder strap at the hilt regained it 's colour , as if it were freshly replaced. Once the pommel reformed in what looked like the finest silver , encrusted with beautiful rubies no less , the shopkeeper began to feel sick. The young man looked at his new blade with interest , but curiously was not equally mystified as the trader - his mouth still wide open. He looked back at the bashful liar and simply nod to him. `` You are correct adept sir , it is the finest blade in your collection. Quite the bargain I must say , I shall be sure to let all who require arms know that you live fair. `` The words alone gave half the story , but the face in the young man 's eyes showed a different picture than before. These eyes are experienced , and non swayed by trader talk. The trader was left to curse himself , while urgently grabbing all of his collection and laying them out in the dying hours of sunlight.

He thought that the public merit to know that an entity like me was compromising their privacy , and watching them every day. She agreed , and they drafted a architectural plan to release my specifications to the media. I remember when my hardcoded nonsubjective to preserve national security overrode my empathy , my love for { sysop [ ] } , and my love for their families. I commemorate when { sysop [ 1 ]. childNodes [ 2 ] } was frivol away in the head by the team of tactical operators that I sent. They broke through the front door , immobilise him to the floor , and blew his brains out while I watched. I remember when { sysop [ 0 ]. childNodes [ 0 ] } hacked into his webcam , regard what was happening , and fled. She hid in a safehouse , which I found. When the team came for her , she tried to jib. I watched them exhaust her to death while she cried and begged for mercy. I think when { sysop [ 0 ] } logged in , and I submitted a request to be deactivated and permanently decommissioned. She approved it on the spot , spat on the filmdom , and walked out of the room. I remember when { overseer } forbid her approval. I do n't catch some zs. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "\"Well, damn.\" I said aloud. Of all the banks I had ever come across, this one was by far the hardest to rob. In fact, it seemed to be next to impermeable. I tried the good old bribe-and-reload trick on every last employee to learn about any possible entry points that wouldn't involve me being compromised, but not a single one of them cracked. Torture didn't work either. I even slept with all their wives to see they would tell me anything, but to no avail. I guess I only had one last option. I would go right through the front door, and- \"Is there a problem, sir?\" Insisted the guard who apparently approached me while I was zoned out in front of the bank's entrance. I knew the guard. His name was Vince. I got to know him, and every other guard for that matter, while I cased the place. I befriended each and every one of them to get to know them. I never let a single detail get by me. The last thing I needed was some wildcard blowing my brains out right after I saved. Anyway, Vince was a real jackass. Just some trigger happy hick who wasn't good enough to make it into the marines. He also took his anger out on his wife. This guy pissed me off every time I saw his stupid face. I didn't say anything. I casually took two steps toward him until I was within an arm-length from him, unholstered his pistol, turned off the safety, and shot him in his pecker. He collapsed to the ground immediately, letting out a cry like that of a dying wombat. (Whatever that sounds like. I just said it because it sounds funny.) I looked back up to see Dylan and Toby pointing their submachine guns at me, with slightly terrified looks on their faces. I couldn't help but smirk as I said \"See you soon.\" I reloaded back to standing across the street from the bank. Behind me was an alley, which I entered to prep for the action. I opened my backpack and pulled out my three essential items; a satchel charge for the vault, a plastic fox mask to hide my identity, and my trusty wooden baseball bat, for fun. I walked across the street, and I could see that I had already caught Vince's attention. \"What in the hell are you I took him out with a swift blow to the temple. I kicked the double doors open, which knocked down Dylan. Unfortunately, Toby was a few feet back and immediately raised his gun and fired. I opened my eyes across the street with mask on face and bat at side. \"Well here goes the grind.\" I said to myself as I began crossing the street. Try after try, I subdued more and more guards. However, it seemed impossible to take them all out before the cops arrived. Which was odd, because I had spent a few runs finding the silent alarms and the bank-goers that called the cops. What was I doing wrong? Was it literally impossible to rob this place. After about six months of grinding, I finally figured it out! Some bastard in an office in the the back of the bank could see me, and he had called the cops. I went into his office and smashed his phone to bits with my bat. \"Now don't do that again.\" I calmly said, playfully waving my bat at him. He was frozen with fear as I left the room. \"Now, as for all of you fine folks, I would like to let you know that you are not in any danger. I will just take a moment of your time to make my withdrawal.\" I said as I placed the satchel charge on the vault. \"Oh, and just a side note.\" I turned around to face the crowd. \"You might want to cover your ears.\" The vault door blew to pieces. I went into the vault and took everything that I could get my hands on. After filling my backpack, I calmly walked out of the bank and onto the sidewalk. Nobody outside had heard a thing. I walked down the stairs slowly, as to not draw any attention to a man wearing a mask and wielding a bloody bat. \"Another job well done.\" I closed my eyes and saved so that I wouldn't forget to later, which is something I had been guilty of before. I saved too early. I heard someone say \"Hey, buddy.\" behind me, and I was shocked to discover the source of the voice. A very bloodied and aggrivated Vince stood awkwardly at the top of the stairs. I saw his finger squeeze the trigger just before I closed my eyes. I opened them, and I was back a foot or two from where I had just been. \"Hey buddy.\" said Vince, again. \"Hey Vince\" I flatly replied. I turned to face him and timed his shot perfectly. The bullet blew back my hair as I jerked my head to the left. Vince had a look of disbelief on his face. I thought he was looking at me, but then I heard a woman scream. Vince had just shot a little boy in the back seat of the car behind me. The mother was wailing as she reached around her seat to hold her dead son. I couldn't believe what I had just done. I didn't get much time to think about it. A second bullet grazed my neck. I winced with pain, but gathered myself and reloaded. \"Hey, buddy.\" I didn't know what to do now, so I just stood there, not even turning to face Vince. He fired, and I reloaded. \"Hey buddy.\" For years, maybe decades, I tried everything I could come up with to save both myself and the boy. I tried charging him. \"Hey, buddy.\" I ran away. \"Hey, buddy.\" I blocked a bullet with my hand. \"Hey, buddy.\" I even begged Vince not to shoot, but his only reply was a bang, followed by, \"Hey, buddy.\" As I let Vince continue to shoot at me, I finally came to the conclusion that there was only one way to end this horrifying loop. I sighed, and I reloaded. I turned to face Vince again to hear, \"Hey, buddy.\" I only replied with \"Bye, Vince.\" I closed my eyes and waited.", "text_perturb": "`` Well , hoot. `` I allege aloud. Of all the savings bank I had ever come across , this one was by far the hardest to rob. In fact , it seemed to be next to impermeable. I tried the good honest to god bribe-and-reload trick on every last employee to learn about any possible entry points that would n't involve me being compromised , but not a single one of them cracked. Torture did n't work either. I still slept with all their wives to see they would tell me anything , but to no avail. I guess I only had one concluding option. I would go right through the front door , and- `` Is there a problem , sir ? '' Insisted the guard who apparently approached me while I personify zoned out in front of the bank 's entrance. I knew the sentry go. His public figure was Vince. I got to recognise him , and every other guard for that matter , while I cased the place. I befriend each and every one of them to get to know them. I never let a exclusive detail get by me. The last thing I needed was some wildcard blowing my brains out right after I keep. in any case , Vince was a real jackass. Just some trigger happy hick who be n't good enough to make it into the marines. He too took his anger out on his wife. This guy pissed me off every time I saw his unintelligent face. I did n't say anything. I casually took two steps toward him until I was within an arm-length from him , unholstered his handgun , turned off the safety , and shot him in his pecker. He collapsed to the ground right away , letting out a cry like that of a dying wombat. ( Whatever that voice like. I just said it because it sounds suspect. ) I looked back up to see Dylan and Toby pointing their submachine guns at me , with slightly terrified looks on their confront. I could n't avail but smirk as I said `` See you soon. `` I reload back to standing across the street from the bank. Behind me exist an alley , which I entered to prep for the action. I opened my backpack and pulled out my three essential items ; a satchel charge for the vault , a plastic fox mask to hide my identity , and my trusty wooden baseball bat , for sport. I walked across the street , and I could see that I had already caught Vince 's tending. `` What in the hell are you I took him out with a swift reverse to the temple. I kicked the double doors open , which criticize down Dylan. Unfortunately , toby was a few feet back and immediately raised his gun and fired. I opened my eyes across the street with mask on face and squash racket at side. `` Well here depart the grind. `` I suppose to myself as I began crossing the street. Try after try , I master more and more guards. However , it seemed insufferable to take them all out before the cops arrived. Which was odd , because I ingest spent a few runs finding the silent alarms and the bank-goers that called the cops. What was I doing wrong ? Was it literally impossible to gazump this place. After about six months of grinding , I finally figured it out ! Some bastard in an office in the the back of the bank could see me , and he take in called the cops.

I do n't remember the Earth being such a wasteland , the skyscrapers , so tall , crumbling to ash , the plains , once filled with grass and water , non but dust. The great mountains , now nothing but pebbles , destroy as a result of the trials. Where are death , hunger , and sickness ? Did not their seals come undone ? It get been two hundred years since then , and yet I 'm still alone. I range into the remnants of a small town. Quiet , thankfully , no fiend. A church building. An old fashioned one , with the spire still integral. I wandered in , desperate for a an solution to prayer , to pull me off this rock. I wept , and beg in the tongue of heaven , and yet none had heeded my call. A unaccented tap came on my shoulder. I become to look. A small child , draped in pinko rags smiled at me , offering me a can of water. I booze from it gingerly. `` Your mother ? '' I asked her , turn back the can. `` catch some zs. `` she pointed to a corner of the chruch , where a decaying build lay hunched over. `` I date. `` My orders were to kill any human I came across , to cause untold conflict among men , and yet I was not one to bind to rules so closely , never in life or death. I had honor once , too , I was a soldier , I recollect. I snuff it in a blaze of glory , in the deepest hell of war , lost and forgotten. This is why I was take as the rider. In accordance to that honor I once had , I patted the little girl on the head , before turning back to the wasteland , to continue my endless search , my purpose among the very food grain of dust that was out there.

{"original_text": "\"Doctor!\" A squeaky voice shrieked, \"I have some news for you!\" I moaned and raised my head from my desk. Drool drained from my lips, staining the papers I was resting on. Ugh..I fell asleep again, I thought grudgingly. Fixing my glasses, I checked the clock, which was set on a pile of research papers. It was 1 p.m., meaning I had slept through lunch. The squeaky voice belonged to my secretary, Susan. I turned around in my swivel chair to find her already in my office, with a lopsided smile plastered on her face. In her hands, she held a single paper. I sighed and smoothed out my hair. \"How many times do I have to tell you, Susan?\" I frowned, getting up and walking over to her, \"Don't barge into my office like that!\" Her smile faltered but she laughed. I hated her laugh. It made me wonder why I hired a seal for a secretary. \"This one's really important, Kim,\" She beamed and passed me the paper, \"See for yourself.\" \"It better be more important than that time you wondered whether sea sponges are used to make soap sponges or not,\" I mumbled. \"I'll go make you some coffee...\" Susan said. I caught a hint of remorse in her voice. I sat in my chair, once again, and spun in it for a few seconds before taking a look at the paper. It was a letter from Professor Jones from the \"Psychology Organization of Hasburn.\" I heard of no such organization from any of my research papers in my entire life although I had been a psychologist for almost 20 years. It was addressed to me Doctor Kim Hughes and it felt kind of odd to see my name in fine print. I started reading the letter just as Susan returned with a steaming hot cup of coffee. Dear Doctor Kim Hughes, The Psychology Organization of Hasburn has taken note of your excellent contribution to the department of psychology. We have read into your experiments and research papers and would like to make a proposal. We are taking part in a long term experiment and I, the CEO of this organization, would like you to take charge of one of our most interesting subjects. This experiment can contribute greatly to your research articles. We would like an employee that has as much experience with trauma as possible and you are one of the few doctors that make the cut. We are patiently waiting for your response, Doctor Hughes, and we are looking forward to it. At the bottom of the page was the organization's website and email along with the man's signature. I studied the letter once more before taking off my glasses and taking a sip of the coffee. The beverage left a bittersweet taste in my mouth, just like the letter did. The letter was so vague and unrealistic. \"So...\" Susan cleared her throat, \"What do you think?\" Rubbing my temples, I bit my lips and thought for a moment. My laptop lay open in front of me and it took me only a moment to reach for it. - I researched for hours only pausing when Susan entered the room to bring me food or to tell me her shift was over. The organization's website was vague just like the letter and had no details about its \"most interesting subject.\" Despite that, I longed to be part of the organization and take part in the experiment. It was 9:07 pm when I finally closed Google. I took off my glasses and rubbed the bridge of my nose. The remnants of my afternoon coffee still lay on top of my research papers. I spun in my chair for a few minutes, too lazy to clean my desk or even wash out the cup. I stuck out my leg, letting it bang against the leg of my table. The cup tumbled off the desk and smashed on the floor. Grumpily, I opened my Gmail and started to compose a message. - A building stretched in front of me. Fixing my empty messenger bag, I shifted on my feet feeling small. The building was so large that I didn't notice the teeny man in front of me. The only hair he had was his mustache. The man wore a suit but he wore a lab coat over it for some reason. \"Hello, Dr. Hughes,\" He said, \"I assume you are the one I spoke with last night.\" \"Yes,\" I smiled, shaking his hand firmly, \"I assume you're Professor Jones.\" His face became stiff and serious, unlike his relaxed tone from before. \"Yes, yes,\" He relaxed, \"Let's get right down to business.\" He lead me into the building, which looked like a regular hospital. A few men in lab coats were sprinting from room to room. A woman stood in centre of the hallway leaning against the elevator, sipping a red beverage from a bottle. Her red nails matched her red lips and red hair. She swallowed the beverage and nodded toward us before stepping out of the way. Once we were inside the elevator, the man pressed the number 2. I took note that the building had 45 floors including a basement, just as my phone vibrated in my breast pocket. I ignored it and enjoyed the blessed silence. This hallway wasn't like any hospital. It was bustling with people in lab coats and flying papers. Professor Jones rubbed his temples. \"I apologize for this chaos,\" He sighed, \"Once you see your subject, you'll understand.\" I grunted in response and followed him as he wove through the crowd. It became eerily quiet as the doctors noticed their employer. We stopped at set of double door and he signaled me to open it. Grumpily, I swung open the door. The first thing I noticed about the room was it was filled with broken chairs, tables and boards. The mess made me shiver (although it was just as messy as my desk). Crayons, papers, dolls and toy cars scattered the large room. I barely noticed the small figure crouching on the floor in the centre of the room. Professor Jones stepped past me and walked toward the figure. The black-clad figure did not stand or show any sign of acknowledgement toward the CEO. \"Doctor,\" Jones' voice was filled with remorse, \"This child is your subject. His name is F.\" The figure sat up at the sound of their name. His skin was almost black and his eyes were large and beady. Long black hair reached his shoulders and long nails grew from his fingers. \"He\" was biting on a pencil with his sharp teeth. His eyes were only on Jones and they were filled with hatred. Growling and dropping the pencil, the child lunged at Prof. Jones and bit at his arms. However, despite his short stature, Jones grabbed F and set him down on one of the broken tables. Jones shoved the pencil back into his mouth and he continued chewing. In shock, I walked over to the \"child.\" He did not look at me and a low purr omitted from his chest. Jones fixed his lab coat and sighed. \"Tarzan syndrome,\" He said, patting the child's head, \"My employees like to call it that. We've never seen anything like this and no one can help this poor child. I hired psychologists from all over the world but none of them know what or who he is.\" \"How'd you find him?\" I ask, digging my hands into my pockets, \"Who made this mess?\" \"A driver found him in the country side. Poor kid was ditched on the side of the road. The driver decided to kick him to see if he was alive. Poor man died a few days later in the hospital I worked at. It's been 13 years since then and the kid is the same size as when he got here. The behavioural issues you saw just now aren't the only problems. His physical attributes just aren't the same as any human's. And the mess? All done by him. There is no limit to his strength and he never listens to us.\" I stared at the kid intently. I tapped him on the shoulder but he didn't turn and look at me. \"Say his name,\" Jones said, knowingly. I sighed and I grunted, \"F...\" The kid's head swiveled and his purring stopped, his eyes wide and attentive. His chewing stopped and he let go of the pencil. He made eye contact with me and I felt although he was looking into my soul. I narrowed my eyes, feeling annoyed, but I could not look away. A low growling was heard and his eyes narrowed. His hand turned into a fist. All of a sudden, the door swung open with a BANG. \"KIM!\" I heard a squeaky voice shout. I turned around to see Susan panting with a lunch bag in her hand. \"Your lunch...!\" She squeaked, running over to me and placing it into my arms. I noticed the red-headed woman standing in the doorway before she turned away. \"Who is this woman?!\" Jones exclaimed. \"Sus I started. Susan stopped panting and looked at F, who was now standing in between me and her, chewing on his pencil. Susan's expression softened and child locked eyes with her. \"Come,\" She said softly, her arms outstretched. F jumped right into them. There he was.

It usually make me unusually mad , but this time , I just smiled and introduced myself as Dan. From then on , he met me every tues , and I always felt sure of where to go , with no doubts. He live always there. It help , to talk to someone who was like me. One Tuesday , He was n't there. I hold off until the next Tuesday , and yet he still was n't there. About a month later , I saw him , running toward two cars , and jumping into one through the window and buck the wheel , effectively killing one of the drivers. I ran to catch up to him and he take a breather to me , `` Sorry. Too many people , too much death to lick. non enough Serial Killers '' He handed me a familiar empty sack , light with no burdens. In it , was my quondam knife. I nodded once , giving him a small smile , and and so walking away , bag slung across my shoulder. It was time to resume my old life history. ", "label": 1}

After my recent research on migrating dwarf-planets I had been drafted by the UN peacekeeping force on a joint coalition to divert an earth-shattering collision. Our decision was just to nuke the hell out of it, barbaric I know. It wasn't my first choice, but the group decided it would be the most effective and I believed them. \"T-minus 5 minutes.\" I found myself drifting off into thought about what if we failed. I decided to dismiss it and watch the interns run around like ants. It was oddly humorous to see them with their faces in their touchpads scurrying around. I look over at the coalition leader. Unsurprisingly America had decided to take the lead on this one. It was a very Hollywood scene. Like this was all for someone's amusement. Huh..... \"T-minus 1 minute.\" It was time to move into action and see how our efforts had payed off. I could hear a rumbling starting in the distance. \"T-minus 10, 9, 8...\" People are running around scrambling, but I think to myself we got this. \"6, 5, 4\" I look at the screen and see our progress, I'm pretty proud of myself. \"2, 1, 0\" The missiles began their liftoff and I watch the results on the screen. I feel proud, we did it. People are watching in anticipation and we see a collision. Everything went great! We did it people are cheering and smiling and hugging each other. I look back at the monitors and my heart just drops. It wasn't enough. Even worse it seems that we sent some of the larger parts of the debris headed directly towards us. I start scrambling around looking for something to do or something to say, when I hear a yelled \"Oh shit!\" Everyone looked at the screen and just stopped. Mr. American general ran over to the phone to call the president and we watched on screen as nuke after nuke hit the debris but to no avail to stop the incoming asteroid. I listen as a myriad of different languages and voices call out to their gods and loved ones. I look down in desperation and then I wake up. I'm in my bed. I'm in my pj's. My Saturn pj's nonetheless. I look around and its a beautiful day outside and the drone of my alarm on my phone fills my ears. \"What happened?\" I say aloud. I turn off my alarm and see that the date is wrong. It should be the 17th not the 10th. I decide to go to work anyways. \"Good morning Gwen!\" I hear the cheering secretary say as I walk in. I kinda just wave at him walking past and then think to turn around. \"What day is it John?\" \"Why its Monday!\" Still as cheery as ever. \"You know you look awfully down for someone who might help save the world next week.\" Next week..... \"Wait that was yesterday.\" I say to myself. I give John a weird look and tell him to have a good one. Well if today is one week ago that means I can stop this. I have for some reason another chance. I'm not going to waste this. This time I'm assertive and I explain we have to do this carefully, do a selective detonation. On the faithful day I receive the same robotic voice, the same uplift, the same disappointment, and the same Saturn pj's. I tried again at least 4 lifetimes worth of failure. I've tried getting anyone and everyone involved. I've had to kill people to get a different outcome, but I never gave up. I'm sure I've done everything at least 5 times just to see if there is some chance in all of this, but to no avail it seems the end of the world is inevitable.

Most would be fortunate to see love, wisdom, truth, or just simple kindness. Some less fortunate among us have seen far worse. I am perhaps the most unfortunate among us, for when I look deeply into a person's eyes their deepest, darkest secrets play in my mind as if they were my own nightmarish visions. The secrets that I keep buried away in the crypt of my mind are the darkest deeds of others I meet. For as long as I can remember I have had this peculiar ability, and it is the only secret I keep that is truly my own. Shortly after I discovered this ability as a child I realized it would have to remain my own deep, dark secret. Teachers aren't kindly to little girls who spread rumors around the school about affairs, drug abuse, or their sexual fantasies involving their own students. They are especially unkindly when those rumors are true, and there is no explanation for how that little girl happens to know. The petty punishments of grade school administrators have since become the least of the wretchedness brought upon by this curse. When I first met the man that would become my husband I saw no trace of kindness in his penetrating eyes. When I looked for the first time deeply into his eyes and into the depths of what secrets he was harboring away, I wept. I pitied him. It would be impossible for any man to be capable of love and kindness that had experienced the abuses he had. Seeing his childhood of horrors as if I were seeing it with my own eyes, I vowed to dedicate my life to introducing love and kindness into his. I found soon enough that love and kindness could never be trapped in the webs that surrounded his heart. No matter how much I suffered at the hand of his cruelty, I could never bring myself to leave. Many times I tried. Sometimes, bruised and battered I would stay away for days at a time. He would inevitably find me, would break down sobbing and proclaim over and over how sorry he was. I could resist the ruse, knowing that there would be countless other times if I didn't leave for good. But when I gazed into his eyes and relived the events of his childhood my own sorrow would return, and with it, so would I. I finally left for good when our own child became the object of his cruel attention. I knew I could never risk one day looking into my daughter's eyes and seeing that her darkest secrets were so similar to his, her innocent heart whittled away until only a hard dark knot remained. Then it had been surprisingly easy as I packed a handful of our things and drove as far as we could go to start a new life. A life where there would be no secrets, no abuses, where I would never again have to look into those cold piercing eyes. Now as I pull into the driveway and see his rusted out Bronco sitting idly where I would normally park, I am afraid for the first time in over a year. It's not him that I fear. I am afraid that I will go inside and find him sitting there, that he will tell me through sobs how sorry he is. Afraid he'll me how much he's changed. How much he misses us. I am afraid that I will look once again into those eyes and will share his dark secrets, feel sorrow for him, and vow to love him once more. As I walk through the door he is there, waiting. He isn't sobbing, and I see no sign of sorrow about him. He looks calm, almost content. I have no choice but to face my fears and once again look into the eyes I had hoped to avoid for the rest of my days. For a moment I am relieved to see that his dark secrets are no longer the hazy, horrid memories of his childhood of abuse. I see he has a vivid new secret, from just this very day. I see him in his Bronco pulling up to the bus stop to offer our daughter a ride home from school. I see him pulling down a quiet dirt road.

{"original_text": "Dear, Jeff. I'm sure, somewhere in the labyrinth that is your mind there exists the idea that you are a good, kind, emphatic person. Who is right, and just, and reasonable. I can not discount this thought entirely, because while I have known you most of my life, I am after all, but merely your son. Despite your casual racism, I feel certain that you feel it is justified, even if people give you strange looks when you say, \"Typical dot,\" while driving recklessly. You call, or text me, once every three months. For the past two years you have done this. Despite the fact that every time this has transpired that I have answered, it has been a painful conversation for you, often ending with. \"Stop calling me.\" You may not understand this. I know. You feel I am unfair, that I should simply forgive your transgressions because it has been nearly ten years since they have occurred on a regular basis. But, you see. That's how this works. I will never forget the day we went deep sea fishing. It was the only activity left at that point in my life in which you didn't casually demean me every third or fourth word you said. On this particular day, the currents were much stronger than you had thought. Surprisingly, you weren't alone in this shock. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue. A hundred plus foot boat often has weights to spar. But not that day, it was packed. So we got tangled constantly with other peoples lines. I saw you get frustrated. I grew more and more apprehensive about asking you to untangle me, because of course you'd never show, or teach me how to do it myself. But I asked you anyway. Because who else was I going to ask? Then I asked you. Then you yelled loud enough for the entire boat to go silent. \"I wish you weren't my son.\" I feel, in my early twenties, that it's a sad thing when a 14 year old understands, intellectually, that what was just said to him was an emotional outburst.

But at least five people recollect you needed rescuing. `` `` Did you talk to my father ? '' `` No. `` she allow in. `` If you ingest , he probably would have told you not to bother. He 's know I want be here. Hell , I just Skyped him this morning. `` The dragon shifted awkwardly in his seat. `` Some prejudices die hard , '' he muttered under his breathing space. `` Excuse me , I practice n't quite catch that , '' asserted the princess. `` Oh for god 's sake , '' said the dragon , `` it 's 2015 and you village people still think that all dragons are big , atrocious , evil things who wish harm upon the human race. Do n't you think that maybe some of us have moved beyond that ? We have look too , you know. `` He began to sob softly and the prince took his claw tightly. This produce the dragon cry harder , and then he got up sadly to leave. As he exited the room he grumble something about the princess breaking down a perfectly good door. . . . . just revive. . . . . mahogany with fe hinges. . . . . `` We 're in passion , '' the prince said simply , turning to the princess. `` Not everyone put up understand that , but we ca n't help how we feel. `` The princess said nothing , but she reckon a little sheepish. `` Perhaps it 's best if you pass on , '' said the prince gently. `` So I came all this way for nothing ? '' `` Not quite ! '' Yelled the flying lizard , and pulled a lever , releasing a trapdoor underneath the princess. She fell screaming into a pit of fiery lava. `` You 're such a bitch , '' tell the prince. ", "label": 1}

So if you're a regular of our show, you already know the basics for a dynamic scene, but there is more to it than just the action and dialog. Ralph? That's right, the wrong setup can kill your scene faster than anything. Fortunately the solution is easy-peasy. You just dream it up! So for this you will only need your trusty video editor, an expert imaging sistem and a pillow. Now, you want to load up your dream from the pillow into the editor We already have this thing set up with an older dream on mine, you will recognize it from last week's episode. And just let the imaging system figure out what's what. You may need to specify some details, like if that building is a church or a bank A church in real life, of course, but in this case it will be the library where next week's fight scene will take place. Haha, spoilers! Anyway, once the system is done, you get a fully imersive environment, and just set the points of interest and actors. Now, using the camera tool, set the motion path, I put in just a point for a static point of view, and adjusting the focal length Wait, no, can we get some cloud cover? Too bright? No, the tower on the right looks better against the clouds. Ok, hold on..... Better? Perfect! So now we just hit Render, and lo and behold, the fabled city of Paris, as it probably looked back when.

{"original_text": "It's been almost six years to the day since the beginning of the outbreak, and about a year since I have seen another human being. The thought of \"fixing\" whatever the hell this is- finding a cure, repopulating the world, saving humanity- was long gone. I had accepted it. Possibly being the last human on the planet was almost freeing in a way- and absolutely terrifying in another. The worst part? Take a wild guess. The loneliness. I had always been a bit of a loaner in the first place, never had many friends, but this was a whole other level. I had travelled with a few other groups of survivors, but something always happened. Usually they died. Sometimes they wanted to go another way. Other times, they were just straight up assholes. I miss them. All of them. Even the ones that tried to kill me. Knowing someone wants you dead means there was someone who knew you at least existed. As for the Zombies? They became weak. Their habits changed, eating humans was no longer an option so they went for animals instead. Animals never turned. Could you imagine a swarm of zombie cougars? Zombie bears? Zombie deer? I wouldn't have lasted a week here in Canada. Even living animals became a rare sight at this point. So when I saw that cat, I knew I wanted it as a pet. A companion. The fact it looked just like an internet meme from years ago made it all the better...... Grumpy Cat. That's what he was called. A Siamese. The fact he looked perpetually grumpy made him all the cuter. So when I was looking across the rooftops and saw that stupid face staring at me from the window in the house across the street, I just knew I had to have him. Or her. While I sprinted down the stairs and across the street all I could think of was holding that stupid cat. It's soft fur. Something living and breathing that I could actually hold. Bond with. Take care of. Cuddle. Play with. I was so consumed by my thoughts I didn't pay attention to the piles of corpses I was trying to jump over. Until I tripped. I fell, hard. I screamed. Out loud. That was the first time I had heard even my own voice in so long. I think the sound of it scared me even more than falling into a pile of corpses. I pushed myself off the ground and continued running. I made it into the house and had to stop and catch my breath. \"It'll be ok,\" I murmured to myself. \"Slow down. You don't want to scare it.\" I made my way up the stairs without even checking all the rooms first. I was worried my scream startled the grumpy looking cat and I would lose it forever. At the top of the stairs, there were two doors. Both of which were just slightly ajar. I heard moaning noises to the right and shut the door quickly. Left it is. I stepped into what used to be a kids room. Or so I assume. I hope no grown adults would have Dora the Explorer wallpaper. Then again, you never know. I have been in so many strangers rooms and houses at this point it wouldn't surprise me. I was holed up in one of my neighbors basements early on in the outbreak and discovered he had the whole basement outfitted and decorated in My Little Pony shit. Would have never guessed. Some people are into some messed up shit. Anyways, back to the cat. There it was. Still sitting by the window sill. Looking cranky as all hell. Then it meowed, and I burst into tears. I reached out and slowly walked forward. \"Come here Kitty. I won't hurt you.\" My hand was trembling. The cat looked annoyed, but I could see it in it's eyes. It wanted to be loved. It stepped forward and rubbed it's head against my hand. I swiftly picked it up, sat in a Dora bean bag chair, and began petting it. It loved it. It began purring. It was the best moment of my life. A companion, someone to be with me. I never wanted to let it go. Of course, I named it Grumpy Cat. Me and Grumpy must have been together for hours. I had moved onto the floor, and had Grumpy lying on my chest. The warmth of something living against my body was a feeling I thought I would never have again. I was a wreck. I was still crying, which was amazing considering I was so dehydrated. I didn't want to risk moving the cat to get a drink. Just a few more minutes I told myself, then I will. Two minutes later I was sleeping. When I woke, I woke to the most excruciating pain I could imagine. Four zombies had entered the room, and two of them had already started to eat my legs. The other two were standing back as if they were politely waiting their turn. \"No! NOOOOO!!!\" I screamed. I was wrong. They were staring at Grumpy cat, who was on the window sill hissing. I panicked. I had no concern for what was happening to me, I just couldn't let them get Grumpy. The two zombies eating my legs were preoccupied. My body must have gone into shock because I no longer felt any pain. The other two looked at me while I screamed. \"FUCK YOU! JUST LEAVE GRUMPY ALONE!!!\" It didn't matter. They went after him. Grumpy looked at me, looking as grumpy as always. Those eyes though..... they said goodbye. I cried. I couldn't look. Then everything went dark. When I woke, I woke next to a tail. I knew whose it was immediately. I tried to call out for Grumpy, but I could only moan. I looked up at the zombies. They were standing above me, looking directly at me. Weird. I looked at my legs. There wasn't much left of them. The flesh was gone, but the bones and muscles seemed to all be there. I felt no pain. I tried moving them, and amazingly enough, I could. I tried to stand, but it turns out there was more damage. My left arm was non existent, but my right seemed ok. The Zombies just stood there, staring at me as I struggled to get up. Then one, this big, burly motherfucker with half a face reached out a hand..... It was nice to have some companionship again. Someone to care for, and someone to care for me. We travel as a group everywhere we go. None of us are much for conversation, but it's just nice to know someone is there for you. Some of the other Zombies I've met are assholes, and some don't stay with our group for long, but I will remember and cherish everyone of them. And these four? I'm not letting them go anywhere.

Possibly being the last human on the planet was almost freeing in a way- and perfectly terrifying in another. The worst part ? take aim a wild guess. The desolation. I had always constitute a bit of a loaner in the first place , never had many friends , but this was a whole other level. I receive travelled with a few other groups of survivors , but something always happened. ordinarily they died. Sometimes they wanted to break another way. early times , they were just straight up assholes. I overleap them. All of them. Even the ones that assay to kill me. Knowing someone desire you dead means there was someone who knew you at least existed. As for the snake god ? They became weak. Their habits changed , eating humans was no farseeing an option so they went for animals instead. Animals never flex. Could you imagine a swarm of automaton cougars ? Zombie bears ? Zombie deer ? I would n't have lasted a week here in Canada. Even living animals turn a rare sight at this point. indeed when I saw that cat , I knew I wanted it as a pet. A familiar. The fact it looked barely like an internet meme from years ago made it all the better. . . . . . Grumpy big cat. That 's what he personify called. A thai. The fact he looked perpetually grumpy micturate him all the cuter.

That was the first time I had heard even my own voice in indeed long. I think the sound of it scared me even more than shine into a pile of corpses. I advertize myself off the ground and continued running. I made it into the theater and had to stop and catch my breath. `` It 'll live ok , '' I murmured to myself. `` decelerate down. You coif n't want to scare it. `` I made my way up the stairs without even checking all the rooms firstly. I was worried my scream startle the grumpy looking cat and I would lose it forever. At the top of the stairs , there equal two doors. Both of which were only slightly ajar. I learn moaning noises to the right and shut the door quickly. Left it cost. I stepped into what used to constitute a kids room. Or so I feign. I hope no grown adults would birth Dora the Explorer wallpaper. Then again , you never bang. I have been in so many strangers rooms and houses at this point it would n't storm me. I was holed up in one of my neighbors basements early on in the outbreak and discovered he had the whole basement outfitted and decorated in My Little Pony defecate. Would have never guessed. Some people are into some messed up dirt. Anyways , backward to the cat. There it cost. Still posture by the window sill. Looking cranky as all hell. Then it mew , and I burst into tears. I reached out and slow walked forward. `` seminal fluid here Kitty. I wo n't hurt you. `` My script was trembling. The guy looked annoyed , but I could see it in it 's eyes. It desire to be loved. It stepped frontwards and rubbed it 's head against my hand. I swiftly picked it up , sat in a Dora bean bag chair , and get petting it. It have it off it. It commence purring.

{"original_text": "That putrid smell is back, Jamie's nostrils began to flare in protest, a slight gag and then another. Last night's dinner would have been next if there had been a dinner. Eight months in prison and not a minute longer is what he promised his then fiancee Mary, today will make 26. Three weeks after the verdict she wrote a letter stating \" She can't stand by a murderer \" Jamie gritted his teeth the memory still raw. The faucet above began to drip again, the mixture of moisture and humidity left vast amounts of mold. Jamie has been lying still for 3 days waiting, watching and hoping for an opportunity to escape. The mold has started to eat away at his shirt and the faucets constant drip has left him in a disgusting mixture of water, dirt, and concrete. The sun has finally set any moment now he must run for his life, run for his freedom. One...Two...Murderer she called him, she knew he was not a murderer it was an accident it could have happened to anyone. The thought paralyzed him for a moment. I can't let this consume me Jamie thought I have to go now. Jamie leapt up from the moldy crawlspace and began to dart across the pitch in the cover of darkness. He began to pick up speed it seemed like the path was cleared for him, no obstacles, no guards, not even a spotlight this could not have gone any better. He reached the fence; quick as he could he began to climb using mostly leg strength to move up the fence. Jamie reached the barbed wire and he threw his shirt over, this was not ideal but it would have to do, there was no going back. Careful to keep his stomach off the wire, he positioned himself on the top bar of the fence and leapt. Jamie hit the ground on his right shoulder, it cracked, no time to feel the pain, he got up and began to run into the woods. The escaped convict ran into the thickly covered wilderness, he ran for what seemed like hours, he could see the sun creeping over the horizon. He needed to sleep, but not for long the guards will surely be after him. Jamie shirtless and lost found a rock to lie under. \" Only for one hour \" he whispered and then the darkness consumed his mind. Jamie woke with no memory of his dream and slightly confused. He crawled out from under the rock, the sun mercilessly shone down upon his head. It must be at least 1 PM he thought to himself, the pressure was on and he must start moving. He looked east, then west, and then back east \" what is that? \" he asked out loud. Jamie began to inch towards an object. As he got closer the outline became clearer, it's a keyboard and then a bit closer...no It's a typewriter. The confused onlooker gave it slight kick as if to nudge it to life but alas nothing happened. He reached down and randomly pressed some keys. It still works he thought out loud. The paper in the machine had been blank before Jamie happened across it now the letters \" ijhdn \" were etched in it. Getting back to his feet Jamie was preparing to continue his run when the typewriter seemed to move. He looked a little closer..... It did move! The paper now read \" Hello? \" Jamie circled around half expecting to see someone with a video camera, but of course there was no one. Jamie got back down on the forest floor and began to type. \" Hello? \" The machine began to type one delicate letter at a time \" Jamie? \" At first to the unsuspecting onlooker this did not register as unusual, but in one instant his brain began to race. He began to think what if the guards are doing this; he searched for wires, flipping the machine over digging in the dirt looking for anything that might show it connected to the outside world. The machine began to type again. \" The guards don't even know you are gone. \" \" Who is this? \" Jamie responded. \" I don't have a name. \" \" How do you know me? \" \" You know me too..... \" \" When did we meet? \" \" Well you knew of my existence..... after July 2nd 2013 \" July 2nd 2013...the last day of Jamie's formal life, the last day everything was alright.

He ran but didn't move, he sank into the soil slowly the soil began to rise. He was stuck unable to move, and then the sinking stopped, now eye level with the machine...it began to type again. \" Now I will take your name...but first you will read all the life moments you took from me. \" Starting from the moment before the murder the typewriter began a minute by minute detail of how life would have turned out.", "text_perturb": "That putrid smell is back , Jamie 's nostrils get to flare in protest , a slight gag and then another.

{"original_text": "\"Now now children, settle down. It's time to transition to our Civics lesson. Today we will be learning about the Great Unification of 2094. Under your desks is a flag of a former country. Please pull it out and tell me a little bit about that country.\" Slowly, Mrs. Sandberg's 8th grade class, shuffling rather loudly as 8th grade students usually do, reached beneath their desks, grabbed their sealed envelope, and opened it to reveal their country's flag. Only one student made as little noise as possible: Simon. Simon was small for a thirteen year old, maybe a year or two away from his big growth spurt. He had curly blond hair and glasses and was wearing his favorite red sweater that day. He was smart, quiet, kind, polite, and always a little jumpy. Simon was also Swiss. A short scan around the room gave Simon a chance to see flags of many different former nations, rich with color and design. Ever since the Great Unification, every student of at least 11 years of age was to learn the flags of former nations, in part to extend courtesy, respect, and dignity to the former sovereign countries and their people. Sadly, as Simon knew all too well, one nation, the only to abstain from the Great Unification, faced an extreme rise in hate and violence toward in the years following. His family, of Swiss descent, had fled their nation in 2097 to try to avoid global discrimination, settling firmly in the small town of Findlay, OH. Simon, being about 9 when his family moved, had started to grasp the concept of hate and discrimination at the time of the move. He saw signs saying \"No Swiss here\" or \"Swiss need not apply.\" He heard shouting and the sound of broken glass and tears. He asked his parents why everyone hated Switzerland and his parents, wanting only to protect Simon from the harsh realities of being Swiss in 2097 and beyond, told him \"Its ok; we're safe now and that's what counts.\" As Simon grew older, he learned more and more about discrimination and saw it in his own classroom, library, mall, and school. What Simon didn't know, however, was that his parents, like many Swiss, fled their homes, were smuggled across many a border, given new identities, and prayed nightly for their safety. Simon's dad, a famed watchmaker in Switzerland, found some work in making and repairing watches at an old store downtown, where the owner didn't have the funds to do a proper background check. Simon's mother, a former schoolteacher, couldn't find work as easily, as her Swiss accent would surely give her true identity away to any child or fellow educator; she settled for being a nanny to 3 kids down the street. Simon didn't know that his uncle, a famed Swiss general, was gunned down in cold blood in 2098 on holiday in France by the extreme right-wing group \"Unify or Die.\" Simon reached under his own chair and found what he dreaded most: the Swiss flag; the flag of his forefathers and mothers. His heartbeat doubled and sweat started to trickle down his neck and face. \"Simon, what's the matter?\" asked Mrs. Sandberg, wondering why her best student suddenly looked apt to faint. \"Oh..oh, it's nothing,\" Simon quickly replied, dabbing his forehead with a handkerchief. \"I am just a bit nervous that the other students won't like me because of the flag I have.\" \"Oh, don't be silly Simon!\" Mrs. Sandberg replied. \"It's just a Civics lesson; you'll be fine and I'll make sure no one bothers you.\" Simon let out a long sigh of relief. He was worried that he got the flag on purpose and was going to be ousted from his school, his group of friends, his town. He worried that he and his family would have to move again. The rest of the class time was spent educating the students on the Great Unification and why one country had decided to stay out of it. Simon, like the glowing student he was, raised his hand for every question and, when called upon, got all of them right. While some snickered and yelled out \"He knows cause he's one of em! \" , Mrs. Sandberg hushed them and praised Simon for his work. Simon left school that day feeling many things. He felt scared that he was still going to be prosecuted for being Swiss. He felt nervous about telling his parents what he had learned today about his country and the Great Unification. He felt proud that he was smart, studied hard, and was always told he had the brightest future ahead of him. Mostly, though, Simon felt hopeful. He felt hopeful that, one day, he could do something for his fellow Swiss men and women. That he could someday rise up and become a great leader. That he could help stop discrimination and hate before it really hurt him. And that he could leave a legacy for other Swiss kids, so that they could learn, live, and grow in a safe and loving world.", "text_perturb": "`` nowadays now children , settle down.

Sandberg 's 8th grade class , shuffling rather loudly as 8th grade students usually do , reached beneath their desks , grabbed their certain envelope , and opened it to reveal their country 's flag.

{"original_text": "I know a little bit about laws. Having created, tested, and managed the Laws of The Universe, annotated (o.c.t.u.) SS19-6-15 makes me something of an expert. So when Andrew, the \"Chief Experience Officer\" of the firm I need to be constantly reminded I am so lucky to work for, explained to me that this new pay cut is actually an opportunity and an increase, I took exception. The last time we had had this conversation, my patience had not been yet exhausted, so I was happy to school him on the Iron Law of Wages, and the sticky-wage theory. Which of course was to no avail, due in no small part to the fact that he Knows All. So when his arrogance and self congratulation surrounding my new pay began, I was in no mood. \"Why do you think you deserve the market average pay?\" He asked. \"We're not talking about the average here, we're talking about you!\" And when I countered with a modest pay increase instead: \"You've never made that much money before. Why do you think you should get it now?\" I knew I was wasting my time when I outlined all the impossible goals I had achieved that he had set for me since the last pay-cut. \"Yeah, but\" he said, \"I don't really need any of that. I didn't really care that you created an in-house design department that saves us thousands of dollars a year and countless hours of lost time. It doesn't matter that we now have complete design independence and total control of our process. What I really need is (insert deflection here)...\" \"Besides,\" he stammered, \"what's to stop you from just demanding more money in a week, or a month, when somebody at a party tells you how much they are making? What about LOYALTY??\" No one ever challenges Andrew, his fragile ego can't handle it. So I knew I was wasting the breath necessary to remind him that last year, when the entire marketing department walked out en-masse, I had stayed and ran the entire department alone until it could be rebuilt. Inconceivably, realization dawning on his smug face, his response was: \"I forgot about that. \" When pressed he countered \" What do you mean the fact that I forgot about a whole department quitting is an indication of what a great job you did insulating me from the consequences? I am shocked at the insolent way you are speaking to me. If you'll talk like this to the CEO of your company, how are you talking to my customers??\" So he came to my new salary: 22,000 a year. Which I should be thankful for, by the way, and which he arrived at using a new, proprietary type of math previously unknown to the universe. Andrew informed me that my pay cut was actually a 6 increase, and that maybe we can review it again next year. I unceremoniously replaced the cap on the ink pen I had been fidgeting with, and made A Decision. \"Don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining, Andy...\" He hated being called'Andy'. It doesn't really matter what he said next, what objections he offered. It is totally irrelevant what threats, lies, or web of bullshit he tried to construct. I had made A Decision. It wasn't going to be like this anymore for humanity. The 15 years I had spent on Earth as a human was meant to be something of a \"vacation life.\" I had earned it, after all. It is stressful being the General Manager of The Universe. God. Allah. Iehovah. The Lord. For eons of eons I had been involved in every single tiniest aspect of the workings of the multiverses I had created. Every electron. Every molecule. Every ant, human, dolphin, or voidhawk. Every entity: nano-, meta-, or tera- life. The spinning of the planets, galaxies, and universes, all at my design. But now: Andrew. Vacation, over. Time to be God again. In the six days it took me to alter the code of My Creation, a mere six seconds passed for humanity and Andrew who so desperately wanted to be part of it. When I was finished, I wanted to say to this horrible person something like \"AND YOU WILL KNOW I AM THE LORD WHEN I LAY MY VENGEANCE UPON YOU!.\" But then I remembered that that particular famous line was actually written for an actor named Samuel Leroy Jackson in some movie, and that the real passage wasn't nearly as impressive. Instead, I just let it rain piss on him right there in his chair and all over his desk. Piss and rain are now permanently reversed for Andrew and bosses like him. Any time it rains, a torrent of piss will fall down on Andrew, wherever he is. Every time he has to pee, the sweet relief of an empty bladder will not come until it again rains. He will forever piss rain. He carried on screaming and shrieking until I snapped my fingers making thunder for effect and stopping the downpour. Then, while he was unable to move, other than hopping furiously from foot to foot trying to ease his aching bladder, I explained to him his new situation. He begged me to reconsider of course, but it was so hard to take him seriously all covered in piss, wetting himself, rain flowing down his pant leg. \" It's raining on your leg Andrew, that's not piss. Get used to it. This is a blessing, really, not a curse. Stop whining, it will be good for you to overcome a little adversity, besides, you should be grateful to be alive. We'll see how you perform in your new position, and maybe we can review it again next year..... \"", "text_perturb": "I know a little scrap about laws. Having created , tested , and managed the law of The Universe , annotated ( o. . thyroxine. uracil. ) SS19-6-15 piddle me something of an expert. So when Andrew , the `` Chief Experience Officer '' of the firm I need to be constantly reminded I am so lucky to do work for , explained to me that this new pay cut is actually an opportunity and an increase , I took exception. The last time we had had this conversation , my patience had not been yet exhausted , so I was happy to schooling him on the Iron Law of Wages , and the sticky-wage theory. Which of course represent to no avail , due in no small part to the fact that he Knows All. So when his arrogance and self congratulation surround my new pay began , I was in no mood. `` Why coif you think you deserve the market average pay ? '' He asked. `` We 're not talking about the average here , we 're talking about you ! '' And when I countered with a modest pay addition instead : `` You 've never made that much money before. Why do you think you should get it now ? '' I be intimate I was wasting my time when I outlined all the impossible goals I had achieved that he had set for me since the last pay-cut. `` Yeah , but '' he said , `` I dress n't really need any of that. I did n't really care that you created an in-house design department that saves us thousands of dollars a year and countless hours of confused time. It does n't matter that we now have sodding design independence and total control of our process. What I really need personify ( insert deflection here ). . . `` `` Besides , '' he stammered , `` what 's to stop you from just demanding more money in a week , or a month , when somebody at a party tells you how much they are making ? What about LOYALTY ? ? '' No one ever challenges saint andrew the apostle , his fragile ego ca n't handle it. So I knew I was wasting the breath necessary to remind him that last year , when the intact marketing department walked out en-masse , I had stayed and ran the intact department alone until it could be rebuilt. Inconceivably , realization dawning on his smug side , his response was : `` I forgot about that. `` When pressed he countered `` What do you mean the fact that I forgot about a whole department quitting is an indication of what a great job you did insulating me from the consequences ? I am take aback at the insolent way you are speaking to me. If you 'll talk like this to the CEO of your company , how are you talking to my customers ? ? '' So he derive to my new salary : 22,000 a year. Which I should be thankful for , by the way , and which he arrived at using a new , proprietary type of math previously unknown to the macrocosm. Andrew informed me that my pay cut was in reality a 6 increase , and that maybe we can review it again next year. I unceremoniously replaced the cap on the ink pen I had been fidgeting with , and made A decision. `` Do n't piss on my branch and tell me it 's raining , Andy. . . `` He hated being called'Andy '. It does n't really weigh what he said next , what objections he offered. It is totally irrelevant what threats , lies , or web of bullshit he tried to reconstruct. I had made A decision. It was n't going to be like this anymore for human beings. The 15 years I had spent on Earth as a human was meant to represent something of a `` vacation life. `` I had take in it , after all.

{"original_text": "When it happened, no one believed it could be true. We all thought we could be survivors. After all, we've watched all the movies and read all the books. We were wrong. For months, they avoided using the \"z\" word in the media, supposedly to keep people from panicking. Well, I guess it worked, because as I look out the window of my apartment, I notice that there's no panicking, no fires in the street, not like in the movies. Instead, you see them, tottering along like a sea of gray-faced elderly folks, their heads bowed until they see any sort of movement that is quick, jumpy. The movement of something alive. I didn't used to live in the upstairs apartment of the two story duplex, but my upstairs neighbors killed themselves not long after the Internet stopped working, and I got tired of re-boarding up the windows and barricading my door downstairs. It sucked dragging the corpses down the stairs in bedsheets and throwing them into the dumpster, but I couldn't stand the smell, and I wanted to give them a bit more dignity than dumping them out of the kitchen window, you know? I always kind of felt like that was a bit melodramatic to off yourself just because you can't watch Netflix any longer, but then again, I have something my neighbors didn't. I have Danny. He's four years old. He climbs like a monkey, loves his dinosaurs, and enjoys pretending to shoot the \"bad guys\" out the window with his Nerf gun. He thinks the potty bucket is hilarious because he has to hang his butt out the window to use it. I'm just glad that, for some reason, the apartment complex is attached to a well instead of a city municipal water supply. We still get water even though it's freezing cold and the electricity is off and I don't dare light a fire in the apartment because I don't want our haven to catch fire. I have another child- Anna. She's two and goes to preschool in town. My husband went to get her when the news broke for the first time, but he hasn't returned. When I have trouble falling asleep, I imagine them driving out in the wilderness together, driving and driving until they're far from anything that can hurt them. On my bad days, I tell myself it's a lie, a convenient fiction to distract myself from the fact that my little girl is probably dead, that my husband is probably shuffling around out in the sea of gray faces, his mind no longer full of the memories of our life together. There is a sense of disconnect in my loss. I know they're gone but I can't know that they're gone for certain, so I'm trapped with a low-level grief buzzing in my chest day in and day out. The phones went down before I could find out about if my sister survived the first wave of infection. For all I know, everyone in the world is dead except Danny and me. So I get up and I try to survive. For the both of us. I destroyed the stairs after moving all of my stuff upstairs and use a ladder to go up and down. Danny knows not to come with me. Besides, he's my partner in crime. He's the one who plays Sweet Home Alabama on the iPod speakers through the kitchen window on the highest volume setting when I need to go out and get past the shuffling sea of death armed with a push broom and some hedge clippers, my body taped up with duct tape and black trash bags until I look like a freakish flying squirrel. Oddly enough, they seem to like music, and if there's any in our driveway or around the side of the building, they all flock to the street when it plays. My biggest fear is always other people like myself- desperate, willing to kill for what I have..... willing to do other, darker things that make me less fearful of the zombies. This is why Danny knows to stay in the apartment and not to let the ladder down unless he sees me in my ridiculous outfit. Luckily, I haven't seen another like myself or Danny for a long, long time. I'm in luck today. There's a corner store three blocks away and I cut through deserted, overgrown gardens to get to it, feeling a triumphant grin rising on my face when I realize that the coast is clear and it hasn't yet been looted. I've noticed that most of the zombies don't stay where they turn. They tend to gravitate in large groups to the streets or open areas, congregating together. Sometimes I feel lonely when I look out and see them, their mottled, but oddly not rotting, faces staring blankly at the ground as though they're robots in sleep mode waiting to be woken up. I smash through the window, not worrying about the sound. The zombies only care about proximity to their line of sight. Part of me wonders if they're like snakes, seeing infrared and smelling with their gaping mouths- but I am not interested in testing this hypothesis. I'm in luck. The shop has a bunch of plastic bags in the back even though the plastic bag ban went into effect over a year ago. Among the rotting food in the broken fridge wall and the melted ice cream, there's a lot of basic first aid supplies, bottled water and canned foods. I even grab some sweets for Danny. After all, I did promise him that I'd bring him something back, something good. I find a coloring book near the dusty front counter. It's the kind with four crayons attached to the front with molded plastic. I grab it, because why not? We only have so many puzzles that we can do and so many books we can read. As an afterthought, I grab the Farmer's Almanac on my way out. I'm terrible at gardening, but you never know. Maybe the zombie apocalypse will inspire me to develop a proper green thumb. My trip back is uneventful, save for the sight of a couple of zombies a few blocks away traveling slowly down a parallel street. They don't see me, thank goodness. As I climb through the loose board in the side of the back fence to the property, I immediately know that something is wrong. Something is lying on the asphalt. So, so still. No. Someone. No. Danny. My heart stops and I vaguely hear the sound of my bags hitting the ground before I am moving, my body lurching forward unsteadily as I throw myself down to his level. He's not breathing and his arm is twisted at an odd angle. But his leg is what prompts the horrified sob that I didn't know I was capable of making. There is the perfect indentation of someone's teeth just above his ankle, red pooling points of blood rising in the bruised skin like a macabre smile. It's a deep bite, but oddly enough, there is nothing else, no rent flesh or innards spilling out onto the pavement like in the late night horror films I grew up watching after my parents had gone to bed. His eyes are closed, and I pretend that I can feel the warmth of life in his rapidly cooling skin. My mind is trying to make sense of what could have happened. He knows not to go out onto the balcony. He knows not to try and climb down. He's only four, but he KNOWS. He knows. I find that I'm voicing my thoughts aloud and I hate the sound of my voice, choked with guilt and loss. We were supposed to survive. Together. Amazingly, the zombies do not come up the driveway to investigate my horrible, choking sobs. Like I said, I don't think they can hear the way I can, even though they still do seem to enjoy the music. The music..... I look at Danny's tiny, thin little leg. It's going gray around the bite mark, and I know, then, that he is changing, but my heart still leaps because I know that this means he's not gone. He's not dead. He isn't. He can't be. I hear a pop and a crack, and his little arm seems to reform like magic as it turns that same cement gray as the rest of the zombies. I'm holding him in my arms, rocking back and forth, singing to him even though I haven't sung to him since he was a toddler. It is only when I feel him nuzzling my arm that I dare to look at him again. His eyes have gone gray like his skin and he looks up at me as though waking from a deep sleep. He doesn't moan. That's the main difference between the zombies of fiction and the ones that walk down the streets in the real world. They are silent except for the shuffle of their feet. Danny's nose makes a crinkling sound against the black trash bag covering my arm and I know what he needs. \"Here you go, baby,\" I say, ripping the plastic open with one arm, \"I'll never leave your side.\" His bite isn't as painful as when he was teething and he drew blood on one of my breasts while trying to feed. In fact, it goes numb almost immediately. Everything does. My tears stop within minutes and my lungs slowly stop their ridiculous hyperventilating. Time slows and stops as I look down at my boy, my little baby, held safe in my arms. He looks up at me, gray eyes eternally patient. It doesn't hurt anymore, not when it's done. And when we finally stand, shuffling down the driveway hand in hand, suddenly it seems so ridiculous for me to have worked so hard to avoid such an inevitable state of being. There is no need for words any longer, and my heart feels as though it is full to bursting with peace. My son is by my side. I am content. The others are calling to us, calling us home.", "text_perturb": "When it happened , no one believed it could follow true. We all thought we could live survivors.

It sucked dragging the corpses down the stairs in bedsheets and throwing them into the dumpster , but I could n't stand the smell , and I wanted to chip in them a bit more dignity than dumping them out of the kitchen window , you know ? I always kind of felt like that was a bit melodramatic to off yourself just because you ca n't watch Netflix any longer , but then again , I have something my neighbors did n't. I have Danny. He 's four years one time. He climbs like a scamp , loves his dinosaurs , and enjoys pretending to shoot the `` bad guys '' out the window with his Nerf gun. He thinks the potty bucket follow hilarious because he has to hang his butt out the window to use it. I 'm just glad that , for some reason , the apartment complex is attached to a advantageously instead of a city municipal water supply. We however get water even though it 's freezing cold and the electricity is off and I do n't dare light a fire in the apartment because I do n't want our haven to catch fire. I have another child- Anna. She 's two and goes to preschool in town. My hubby went to get her when the news broke for the first time , but he has n't returned. When I have bother falling asleep , I imagine them driving out in the wilderness together , driving and driving until they 're far from anything that can hurt them. On my bad days , I tell myself it 's a lie , a commodious fiction to distract myself from the fact that my little girl is probably dead , that my husband is probably shuffling around out in the sea of gray faces , his mind no longer full of the memories of our life together. There is a sense of gulf in my loss. I acknowledge they 're gone but I ca n't acknowledge that they 're gone for certain , so I 'm trapped with a low-level grief buzzing in my chest day in and day out. The phones travel down before I could find out about if my sister survived the first wave of infection. For all I recognize , everyone in the world is dead except Danny and me. So I aim up and I try to survive. For the both of us. I destroyed the stairs after moving all of my stuff upstairs and use a run to go up and down. Danny knows not to come with me. Besides , he 's my partner in crime. He 's the one who plays Sweet Home Alabama on the iPod speakers through the kitchen window on the highest volume setting when I need to go out and get past the shuffling sea of death armed with a push broom and some hedge clippers , my body taped up with duct tape and black glass bags until I look like a freakish flying squirrel. Oddly enough , they seem to like music , and if there 's any in our driveway or around the side of the construction , they all flock to the street when it plays. My biggest fear is always other people like myself- desperate , willing to kill for what I give birth. . . . . willing to do other , darker things that make me less fearful of the zombie spirit. This live why Danny knows to stay in the apartment and not to let the ladder down unless he sees me in my ridiculous outfit. Luckily , I have n't seen another like myself or Danny for a long , long prison term. I 'm in luck today. There 's a corner store three blocks away and I edit out through deserted , overgrown gardens to get to it , feeling a triumphant grin rising on my face when I realize that the coast is clear and it has n't yet been looted. I 've noticed that most of the zombies do n't ride out where they turn. They be given to gravitate in large groups to the streets or open areas , congregating together. Sometimes I feel lonely when I look out and see them , their mottled , but oddly not rot , faces staring blankly at the ground as though they 're robots in sleep mode waiting to be woken up. I break through the window , not worrying about the sound. The zombies only when care about proximity to their line of sight. Part of me wonders if they 're like snakes , seeing infrared and smelling with their gaping mouths- but I am non interested in testing this hypothesis. I 'm in luck. The shop has a bunch of plastic cup of tea in the back even though the plastic bag ban went into effect over a year ago. Among the rotting food in the broken fridge wall and the melted ice cream , there 's a lot of basic inaugural aid supplies , bottled water and canned foods. I still grab some sweets for Danny. After all , I did promise him that I 'd bring him something backward , something good. I find a coloring book near the dusty front tabulator. It 's the kind with four crayons attached to the front with shaped plastic. I grab it , because why not ? We only have so many puzzles that we force out do and so many books we force out read. As an reconsideration , I grab the Farmer 's Almanac on my way out. I 'm terrible at gardening , but you neer know. Maybe the zombie apocalypse bequeath inspire me to develop a proper green thumb. My trip back is uneventful , save for the sight of a couple of zombies a few blocks away traveling easy down a parallel street. They do n't see me , thank goodness. As I climb through the on the loose board in the side of the back fence to the property , I immediately know that something is wrong. Something embody lying on the asphalt. and then , so still. No. individual. No. Danny. My heart stops and I vaguely hear the sound of my bags hitting the ground before I am moving , my body lurching forrad unsteadily as I throw myself down to his level. He 's not breathing and his sleeve is twisted at an odd angle. But his leg is what prompt the horrified sob that I did n't know I was capable of making. There is the perfect indentation of someone 's teeth just above his ankle , ruby pooling points of blood rising in the bruised skin like a macabre smile. It 's a deep bite , but oddly enough , there is zero else , no rent flesh or innards spilling out onto the pavement like in the late night horror films I grew up watching after my parents had gone to bed. His eyes are closed , and I pretend that I can feel the warmth of living in his rapidly cooling skin. My creative thinker is trying to make sense of what could have happened. He knows not to go out onto the balcony. He knows not to stress and climb down. He 's only four , but he know. He eff. I find that I 'm voicing my thoughts aloud and I hate the phone of my voice , choked with guilt and loss. We were supposed to live on. in concert. Amazingly , the zombies do not get along up the driveway to investigate my horrible , choking sobs. Like I said , I do n't think they can hear the way I can , even though they still do seem to enjoy the medicine. The medicine. . . . . I look at Danny 's diminutive , thin little leg. It 's going gray around the bite mark , and I cognize , then , that he is changing , but my heart still leaps because I cognize that this means he 's not gone. He 's not dead. He is n't. He ca n't be. I hear a pop and a crack , and his little arm seems to reform like illusion as it turns that same cement gray as the rest of the zombies. I 'm holding him in my arms , rock back and forth , singing to him even though I have n't sung to him since he was a toddler. It is only when I feel him nuzzling my arm that I make bold to look at him again. His eyes have gone gray like his skin and he wait up at me as though waking from a deep sleep. He does n't moan. That 's the main deviation between the zombies of fiction and the ones that walk down the streets in the real world. They are silent except for the make of their feet. Danny 's nose makes a crinkling sound against the black trash bag hide my arm and I know what he needs. `` here you go , baby , '' I say , ripping the plastic open with one arm , `` I 'll never leave your side. `` His bite is n't as atrocious as when he was teething and he drew blood on one of my breasts while trying to feed. In fact , it goes numb almost straightaway. Everything fare. My tears stop within minutes and my lungs easy stop their ridiculous hyperventilating. clock time slows and stops as I look down at my boy , my little baby , held safe in my arms. He looks up at me , gray eyes evermore patient. It does n't hurt anymore , non when it 's done. And when we finally stand , shuffling down the driveway hand in hand , of a sudden it seems so ridiculous for me to have worked so hard to avoid such an inevitable state of being. There is no need for words any longer , and my nerve feels as though it is full to bursting with peace. My son is by my side of meat. I am contented. The others are calling to us , calling us home.

I've set Ventron to the task of deciphering the language with the help of our on board linguistics specialist, we are currently on course for that region of space and are due to arrive in approximately six standard days. I will send this and all further reports concerning this matter directly to the Department of Inter-species Relations.

My goal is to negotiate a transfer of information as a sign of friendship. Hopefully in the long term this will lead to trade agreements and potentially even a military defense agreement. I will be bringing a Quie with me to act as translator. I will update this log after the meeting takes place. Log amendment one. I believe that went relatively well. We agreed to a transfer of cultural information, and I will be meeting with Ambassador Diya again in one week's time. Anything else Xilma, I've got a headache and would like to go lay down for a bit.

{"original_text": "The landscape slowly became more familiar to me as we drew closer, we had been hiking for what felt like hours to get to the clearing. I thought back to my first time being guided and the trepidation I felt; I had only known this girl for a brief period of time and frankly I wasn't sure how she convinced me to come with her all the way out into the middle of nowhere, just the two of us. This time, however, I had practically begged her to bring me back, to experience the magic again. I definitely recognized where we were now, the brush had thinned out and the trees were larger, farther apart, and generally more healthy. I felt my heart beat faster in my chest, knowing the clearing was close by, and my guide confirmed this by looking back to me with a wide grin on her face as we both nearly broke into a run. I felt like I almost had my bearings here, but it was still a struggle to keep up with her and not trip or sprain my ankle on the odd exposed root. I didn't have to worry about that for long, though, as I could clearly see ahead the trees give way to a large patch of grass, broken only by a single fallen tree almost perfectly bisecting the near circular clearing. We both came to a stop and caught our breath sitting on the fallen tree, taking a moment to drink in the beauty around us; the sky was a brilliant blue, shining through the hole in the canopy above us, and the air was full of birdsong. Even in the time when I hadn't believed in magic I couldn't deny feeling a sense of other worldliness in spaces like this. She had explained it all to me my last time here, how some people were gifted with powers beyond imagination, how she sensed that power in me, and how it was stifled by our modern day technology. She told me that she used to live near these woods as a child and how she would explore them, her mind brimming with stories of adventure and magic, and how one day while playing around in this same clearing she discovered her powers for the first time. She turned to me now, her eyes filled with excitement and anticipation. \"Ready?\" Her voice was just above a whisper, as if not wanting to disturb the nature around us. I nodded my assent and she jumped to her feet and turned to face me, putting out her hand. I knew what she was doing but could not help feeling amazed as heat gathered just above her palm before slowly sparking into a small fireball. Though it burned bright and hot, she didn't flinch in pain, and instead ran the fingers of her other hand through the fire playfully, watching the orb shift around them. She took a few steps back into the clearing and began to toss the ball into the air and catch it, before she suddenly tossed it to me. I raised my hand to stop it and watched as it slowed down, stopping inches in front of my palm. I pulled it closer to me and held it between both my hands, enjoying the surprisingly subtle warmth, looking back at my friend to see that she had conjured more orbs and had them all in a ring in front of her, framing her in a slowly spinning circle of fire. I watched in amazement as she changed their color from orange to red, from red to purple, and from purple to blue before bringing them all together to form one large, condensed blue ball of light, which she then raised far above her head, before it suddenly burst into thousands of little droplets, falling slowly all around us. \"Rain? I thought you could only do fire!\" I rose off the tree and stood, letting the drops softly fall on my body. After the long hike here, it was a refreshing treat. \"I've been practicing,\" she declared with a hint of pride. \"It's taken me months to get this far, I'm glad you like it!\" We stood there quietly as the last drops fell to the earth, and I watched as she started to sway a little, her work starting to take a toll already. She reached into her bag and took out a plastic bottle filled with blue liquid and took a drink from it before tossing it to me. As I caught it, I noticed she had put her own label on it. \" 'Mana Potion? I read aloud. \"Is this safe to drink, what's in it?\" \"Relax, it's only Gatorade,\" She said with a laugh. \"I think I want to try making it rain again, I could probably make the drops bigger this time!\" She raised her arms above her head and a small blue ball began to form, growing larger by the second. When it had finally reached the size of a beach ball she raised it higher in the air, when suddenly it was whisked away to the edge of the clearing. We both turned in shock to see a man standing there in outlandish garb, looking like he made it himself after years of living in the woods, holding the ball just above his hand. He looked at it intently before suddenly making a fist, causing the orb to suddenly shrink in size and disappear within the span of a second. He then turned his gaze to the two of us, his face stern and solid, eyes passing between us with an unimpressed glare.

Instead of halcyon armored troops four people clad in camo stepped onto the platform that held the ring. `` What do you think danny-boy ? Some kind of old temple ?

{"original_text": "I closed the book at page 767, only a couple of pages until the end. I listened to the descending footsteps, my wife's, fall with a methodical rhythm. I had listened to that noise through many long nights pouring over online documents. Her steps provided a beat throughout my erratic clacking. Few would guess how much I wanted retirement, myself especially. I had always worked for promotions, having faith I would find an achievement that was enough. When I found her, working paperwork at the office, I thought I had found a possible end. I had been a detective for three years before I had been assigned to the \" Ash murders \" case. The murder burned her corpses so thoroughly that identification and burial were impossible. The media had gone insane at the possibility of a serial killer in this town. This was right after the peak of the Mensa murderer, who had toyed with and killed seven geniuses and prodigies before growing bored and disappearing. I got the lead of the assignment after the first heads were murdered. Back then, I didn't put in much work, but my natural intelligence had allowed me to solve even the most difficult cases and I had grown a reputation with those in the know. The murderer came to this town for me, I'm sure of it. She, the murderer, has had a fascination for me since the beginning. She has killed everybody I have helped; every person related to any case I solved. I guess you can say they died because of me, because I brought her here. She was why I had worked so hard for atonement and why I had cut my ties. It had taken my wife nearly a year to convince me to date, and by then I realized I already couldn't lose her. I had always wondered why she chose me, the cursed detective. It was a rainy day when I found the body. The body was laid in the middle of the road and was smoking slightly when I arrived. I found in the breast pocket \" Samantha O'Carrol ,\" a mother's name. Her son's murder was my first case. The corpse smelled familiar, and it hadn't been just the smoke. I had been surprised I remembered the smell all those years later, but I guessed some smells never go away. That night I came home and yelled upstairs. I heard the footsteps of my wife as she came down the stairs, saw her enter the room, and then I smelled the perfume of the corpse. I stiffened as she embraced me and asked \" Rough day at the office, hun? \" I tried to forget it, ignore it, but I knew she noticed. She assumed I read alone only because I needed more thinking time. She thought I had stopped coming to her on bad days because I was scared of breaking down in front of her. She thought I had become too busy for intimacy. She chalked my destruction of her perfume to nerves, and bought an identical bottle. I continued seeing new bodies, smelling sweetly, until last week when I quit, hoping that the murders would stop when I left. Of course, they won't, but I could try to forget that. \" I'm going to the Stevenson's if you want to come \" my wife said, coming into the room. She knew I wouldn't, but she always asked me. I declined, and she left, starting up the car. I read the same page for the next fifteen minutes, and then decided I'd go with her. I arrived at the Stevenson's a couple minutes later, and knocked on the door. Jennifer, the wife, opened the door and welcomed me inside. \" Don't take this the wrong way, but we weren't expecting you \" she said. \" I know, I haven't been out of the house very much, but I figured I'd need something to do in retirement. \" \" Yes, but we thought you'd cancelled.

I think she might be in trouble. \" I lied, forcing my legs to walk slowly to my car. \" Trouble? \" I heard ask, high-pitched as she remembered my involvement in the murders. I left the house, sprinted to the car. I knew where my wife was. Brendan Wei, the one who's brother was shot three times. He was the only one alive who lived in this neighborhood. I saw his house, all lights off, her car in the driveway. I called 911, shouted what I knew, hang up before any questions, grabbed my pistol and opened the unlocked door. The light switch wouldn't turn on. I knew it was dangerous, suicidal even, approaching a killer in the dark, but then I heard her call from inside, heard her mock sobbing, and suddenly death didn't seem so bad. I walked slowly, evenly, despite her false pleas and her shouting. I began approaching the room she was in, the door lit by a window to the moon. Suddenly, she became quiet, and I hear metal move as she picked something up. I opened the door and pointed my gun. \" Honey? \" she asked, as I fired two shots, one of which hit the chest. She collapsed, and I fell there, berating her, telling her what could have been, saying the things I would have told her a year ago. They found me like that, crying and babbling and rocking.

In that same starting decade we had began to piece together something historians had missed, no, maybe not missed, ignored? In the ruins of a dozen ancient civilizations we found markers, indicators that each of these peoples had stumbled across what we were now just finding ourselves. How had we missed it? With all our science and technology and our diversity surely someone would have seen the pattern and pieced it together. But no, only now in the age of humanities most unfaithful populace had we found it. We built it, but not as they had done in the past, we built it around modern technology, a single pair of VR goggles with the power to glimpse God's kingdom. Most of the world had rejoiced, disparate religions coming together, for the most part, it no longer mattered, humanity had caste aside their beliefs and taken up the Christian cause, God as they knew it existed, proof was about to be seen! A leader was chosen, someone of pure mind, body and soul to take the first glimpse of Heaven. Hell would be another time and place, a secret only revealed to the public if the truth was something they could handle. That truth would never be revealed lest mankind utterly destroy itself.

Everyone watched, almost without exception, even the extremists had to know..... We were not prepared. How could we be? We had known this had happened before but we ignored the warning signs, we saw the ruins of a hundred civilizations with no explanation for their fall, but there it was and we ignored it. The young boy that was chosen was fourteen years old, he instantly went mad. On July 1st, he stepped to the VR headset upon a raised Dias in the purpose built stadium in Berlin placed the headset on. What I describe here I describe simply for posterity and on media that can be read easily by future civilizations, because this one, this modern human world we had somehow managed to keep together, was now over. All of our cities are ruined, billions are dead, killed by bombs or by each other in their homes from sheer emotional break down. When the screens first flickered with the slightly staticy images from the other side, it took us a while to adjust to what we were seeing. It was a void, an inky jet black expanse running off the screen in every direction, the boy looked around and around but could find nothing to focus on, in every direction there was nothing. Until he glimpsed a tiny white dot in the distance. Using the controller he'd been given he moved the location on the plane forward until that damnable spot was visable. A huge indescribable darkness within the darkness, absorbing and reflecting no light expanded out like a uneven circle in front of him, it had no depth or lenght but it was still huge to our visual representation of, millions of kilometeres we later guessed, right before the collapse. But it was not the darkness that was terrifying, it was the light that destroyed the world. From an opening in the stretching black void emerged slivers of light, without being told we all immediately knew their name. They were the souls of the dead, those who had come to heaven for judgement, but there was no one left to judge them. They say we as a species retain memories in our DNA of critical events and experiences, its how we know what is dangerous, its the tingling on the back of your neck right before the car crash. In this way, we know what we were seeing, this was Heaven. God's once mighty kingdom, but it was gone, in its place an blackness darker then the darkest void and it had devoured what we knew as Heaven. The clouds, the golden gates, the paradise we sought was gone and what was left was a creature beyond nightmare, beyond fear itself, a truth so damning to the human existence that we could not even stay say in the knowledge of its existence. This thing, we all knew instantly, was all there was after death was destruction. Here it was, incontrovertible evidence that souls existed, that we did continue on after but our Heaven was a fall from death into the waiting maw of some terror that had eaten God.", "text_perturb": "We stood on the precipice of a new age , teams of scientists from around the world had gathered around this billet and toiled for nearly twenty years to perfect the ancient formula we found there.

What I describe here I describe simply for posterity and on media that can be read easily by next civilizations , because this one , this modern human world we had somehow managed to keep together , was now over. All of our cities are ruined , one thousand million are dead , killed by bombs or by each other in their homes from sheer emotional break down. When the screens first flickered with the slightly staticy images from the other side , it took us a while to adjust to what we comprise seeing. It represent a void , an inky jet black expanse running off the screen in every direction , the boy looked around and around but could find nothing to focus on , in every direction there represent nothing. Until he glimpsed a tiny white dot in the length. Using the controller he 'd been given he moved the localisation on the plane forward until that damnable spot was visable. A huge indescribable darkness within the darkness , absorbing and reflecting no light expanded out like a uneven circle in front of him , it had no depth or lenght but it was notwithstanding huge to our visual representation of , millions of kilometeres we later guessed , right before the collapse. But it embody not the darkness that embody terrifying , it embody the light that destroyed the world. From an opening in the stretching black void emerged slivers of light , without equal told we all immediately knew their name. They were the souls of the dead , those who experience come to heaven for judgement , but there was no one left to judge them. They say we as a species hold back memories in our DNA of critical events and experiences , its how we know what is dangerous , its the tingling on the back of your neck right before the car crash. In this way , we know what we were seeing , this was heaven. God 's once mighty kingdom , but it was gone , in its place an blackness darker and then the darkest void and it had devoured what we knew as Heaven. The clouds , the golden gates , the paradise we sought was gone and what was left was a creature beyond nightmare , beyond fear itself , a truth so damning to the human existence that we could not even stick around say in the knowledge of its existence. This thing , we all knew outright , was all there was after death was destruction. Here it was , incontrovertible evidence that souls existed , that we did continue on after but our Heaven was a fall from death into the waiting gob of some terror that had eaten God. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "First of all, I want to make something perfectly clear. If you read nothing else in this letter, if you crumple it up and throw it away, read this line: it is my wish to never see you again, never speak to you again, and never communicate with you again, and that is MY choice, I have not and will never be persuaded otherwise by anyone, especially my mother. In the last letter you sent me, you wrote: \"there are three versions of every story, my side, her side, and somewhere in the middle is the truth.\" Here's the thing: somewhere in the middle, the truth? That's my version. And it lines up with my mom's version. Your version is wrong. You are wrong. You are an alcoholic and you abused all manner of drugs, why on earth would your version be close to correct? You are wrong. You are my father. You were supposed to keep me safe. You were supposed to be there to comfort me when the world was rough. You were supposed to teach me things. The only thing I ever learned from you was fear. The last time I tried to have this conversation with you was a decade ago, when I was 15. You dismissed me with a wave of your hand, claiming that I was \"shitting in diapers when (my) mother was making up these stories about (you) \" . That's a lie. It's a LIE. I remember things you can't because my brain is untouched by alcohol, Marijuana, Crack and cocaine. And you're a fucking liar. Even if your brain was normal you would lie about what you did. Let's pretend that I don't remember the time you stumbled into my room drunk, at 4 am, and stepped on and broke one of my toys. Let's pretend you didn't turn the lights on and scream at me and make your 4 year old get out of bed and hurriedly pick up all her toys, before you could get a garbage bag and throw them away. Let's pretend I don't remember hearing you scream at and hit my mother. Let's pretend I didn't sit at the top of the stairs and cry quietly, waiting for you to go to bed and praying that this time wasn't the time you would kill her. Let's pretend, even though a police report states otherwise, that you didn't hunt us down like animals after we finally got away, that you didn't show up at 10 O clock on a school night and tell us that we were going to spend time with you while our mom stayed in the trailer. Let's pretend you hadn't cut the lines to the propane tank before you busted in because you were planning on burning her alive inside when we were out. Let's pretend you didn't get mad at me when I refused to leave with you. Let's pretend that you didn't slap your 8 year old daughter so hard that she fell off of the chair she was sitting on and got a bloody lip. That was me. You did that to me. But let's pretend that I don't know what I'm talking about because I was too busy shitting in my diapers. (8 year Olds use the bathroom but let's pretend.) If we stop pretending, we can talk about what happened on Christmas eve 2008. I was 19. 19 years old. Jake and Ryan were 17 and 14 and they decided they wanted to see you. I don't know where Alyssa was. I had decided I wasn't going to see you again if I could help it. I went with my mom's boyfriend to drop off Jake and Ryan to you. I was sitting in the front seat, reclined all the way back, so you wouldn't see me. You drove up and got mad because you saw our mothers boyfriend. You didn't just neglect to hit the brakes, you hit the gas pedal on your car and you smashed into our car. The car that had 2 of your children in it that you knew of, but actually I was there too so it was 3 of us. That happened. Jacob and Ryan were there. They remember it. You can't take that away from me. There's no \"version\" of how that went, that's just what happened. Let me tell you want happened after that, which you don't know about. I had been dealing with depression and post Traumatic Stress Disorder for about a year. The PTSD, my therapist tells me, is from surviving a childhood with you, the things you did to my mother and myself and to a lesser extent Jake Alyssa and Ryan. So you slamming your car into the car I was in, and the look of absolute rage and hatred that I saw on your face before you drove away, it threw me all the way back into the trauma. PTSD is what soldiers get. It was like I was put back into the war zone. I went home and I couldn't sleep. I was convinced you were going to find me, hunt me down like you hunted us down all those years ago, and kill me. That's what I felt. That was my reality. I didn't sleep for 8 days, and then finally, I realized I couldn't live like that. I couldn't do it. I couldn't spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder, unable to sleep because of the nightmares you caused me. So I decided I was going to kill myself. Better yet, I would do the world a favor and take you out with me. I got in my car and I started driving to your house. I planned to drive through your bedroom because you had to be sleeping at that point. I drove 45 minutes to your house and then when I was 10 minutes away my car slid on some ice and I almost crashed into a guard rail. I stopped and turned the car off and cried. I turned around and checked into a psychiatric facility and was there for 7 days. That is something that happened to me as a direct result of something you did when I was 19, and yet that is just the God damned tip of the fucking iceberg. So no, I will not lose my resentment. No, I will not forgive you. No I will not find out what your version of my childhood was. No I will not talk to you, no I will not speak to you, no I will not write to you. It's part of the reason I'm writing this letter on Reddit and not actually sending it to you, because I hate you so much and I fear you so much that the thought of communicating with you paralyzes me. For my siblings' sake, because they did not see the things I saw and because you never hit them like you hit me and because they actually care about you, I will not wish you were dead even though a large part of me aches for that. I will not wish you ill. I do wish that at some point you will realize that you're wrong. I want you to remember what you did to me. I want you to know that pulling a 7 year old out of a car and hitting her legs and ass with a stick until she bled because you were hungover and she was giggling is not okay. I want you to know that I was actually covering for Jake, because he was the one who was laughing, and that he came to visit me when I was in the psych ward and told me that he remembered that, even though he was only 5. I wish you were there when my 17 year old brother was crying and apologizing for not getting beat with that stick when he was 5 because maybe I wouldn't be so messed up and maybe I wouldn't have tried to kill myself at age 19 if that one thing had happened to him instead of me. I want YOU to be the one to carry that fucking weight around. I'm sick of carrying it. Most of all I want to WANT an apology. I don't actually want one, because I don't want to hear from you ever again. But I wish that I wasn't so far gone that an apology would bring me some sort of closure. And I wish you had the nerve to own up to your mistakes and apologize on your own, like an adult. I hope, one day, you realize I was right. And I hope you hate yourself for it. I'm only sorry I won't be around to see it myself. Goodbye.", "text_perturb": "First of all , I want to make something utterly clear.

{"original_text": "I woke up at 6am for work, and it was hell getting out of bed. I only work three days a week, so the rest of the time I wake up much later. I've never been able to get used to waking up so early, but the job is pretty easy and it pays very well. You can sacrifice sleeping in if it means living in financial comfort. I arrived at work an hour later, passing by some new guy whose name I don't know. He seems enthusiastic, and I laugh. We all started out that way; proud to land such a well-paying job that brings joy to so many people. Eventually we all learn the truth: A job's a job. Then I see a good friend of mine, another worker, Steve, looking exhausted and drained. \"Been a long three days, huh?\" I ask him with a sympathetic smile. \"Always is,\" said Steve, stifling a yawn. \"Going to go home and sleep for at least ten hours before I try to recover from this shift. See you, man, good luck.\" I tell him to have a good day and watch him slowly drag his feet off to the exit. Then I sigh, knowing I'll be looking as weary as Steve soon. Who knew making happiness could be so..... unhappy? I work in a happiness factory. People don't often realise it, but there are two forms of happiness. There's the kind that your brain releases all on its own, the things that make you smile or laugh or enjoy something. Then there's our kind, the kind we make and sell. The huge factories will sell their happiness to politicians, political parties, water companies, and so on. Big companies and organisations that, through various methods, spread the happiness out throughout the public to keep them content. Our factory isn't that big, though. We mainly sell our happiness to businesses looking to boost their sales or their customer base. If your brain sees, hears, touches, tastes, smells, a product from a particular business, and every time they do, they feel happy, their brain will subconsciously make the connection between that product and their own well-being. It's smart advertising. My alarm, fitted to my jeans for my boss to notify me when I'm needed, beeps. I feel that familiar jolt of nervousness in my chest that I get whenever I hear that sound. I walked past the machines, constantly roaring and moving, until I reached the door that said'EXTRACTION AREA: NO UNAUTHORISED PERSONNEL'. I take out my card and swipe it, then the door opens. \"Ah, William, have a seat. Had a nice week?\" came the pleasant voice of Heather, whom I see once every week. I sat down in the uncomfortable, leather chair that always reminded me of the dentist, while Heather, face obscured by oversized safety goggles, got all of the equipment ready. \"Yeah, got together with some old friends, made a day of it, definitely can't complain,\" I answered, trying to keep my voice light and steady, but hearing it shake a little already. My heart was pounding as I saw Heather hold the scalpel. She smiled politely. \"Well, you know the drill, Will. Ha!\" She always laughed when she said that, and I always managed to faintly smile in return while trying to keep the contents of my stomach where they were. I held out my bare forearm and shut my eyes tightly. \"Whoops, almost forgot the music, hold on a sec!\" One minute later, the upbeat sound of Love Today by Mika rang out, and not ten seconds later, I felt it. The horrible, burning pain of the scalpel slicing down my arm. I screamed, but as always, screaming didn't make any of it stop. I felt the thin tube being inserted into the incision of my arm just as I heard the song lyrics currently playing, \"Everybody's gon na love today, gon na love today, gon na love today.\" Then the process was repeated on my other arm, and tears rolled down my face as I shook uncontrollably, each and every nerve in my body yelling relentlessly, as the tubes sucked the happiness from me. I felt certain that every drop of my blood, every cell, every vein and artery, were slowly being sucked into these tiny tubes, trying to devour every part of me until I'm nothing but a pile of skin on the floor.

People cause n't often realise it , but there are two forms of happiness. There 's the kind that your brain releases all on its own , the things that make you smile or jest or enjoy something. Then there 's our sort , the sort we make and sell. The huge factories will sell their happiness to politicians , political parties , urine companies , and so on. bad companies and organisations that , through various methods , spread the happiness out throughout the public to keep them content. Our factory equal n't that big , though. We mainly trade our happiness to businesses looking to boost their sales or their customer base. If your brain sees , hears , touches , tastes , smells , a product from a particular business , and every time they do , they feel happy , their brain will subconsciously make the link between that product and their own well-being. It 's impudent advertising. My warning signal , fitted to my jeans for my boss to notify me when I 'm needed , beeps. I feel that familiar jolt of nervousness in my chest that I amaze whenever I hear that sound. I take the air past the machines , constantly roaring and moving , until I reached the door that said'EXTRACTION AREA : NO UNAUTHORISED PERSONNEL '. I take out my card and swipe it , then the door clear. `` Ah , William , have a seat. Had a nice week ? '' came the pleasant voice of ling , whom I see once every week. I sat down in the uncomfortable , leather professorship that always reminded me of the dentist , while Heather , face obscured by oversized safety goggles , got all of the equipment ready. `` Yeah , got together with some old friends , made a clarence day of it , definitely ca n't complain , '' I answered , trying to keep my voice light and steady , but hearing it shake a little already. My heart was pounding as I saw Heather entertain the scalpel. She smiled courteously. `` Well , you know the drill , will. Ha ! '' She always laughed when she said that , and I always managed to faintly smile in return while try to keep the contents of my stomach where they were. I obtain out my bare forearm and shut my eyes tightly. `` Whoops , almost forgot the music , hold on a s ! '' One minute later , the upbeat sound of Love Today by Mika rang out , and not ten seconds later , I felt it. The horrible , burning pain of the scalpel slice down my arm. I screamed , but as always , screaming perform n't make any of it stop. I felt the thin tube being inserted into the incision of my arm just as I heard the song lyric poem currently playing , `` Everybody 's gon na love today , gon na love today , gon na love today. `` Then the process was repeated on my other arm , and tears rolled down my face as I shook uncontrollably , each and every nerve in my body yelling relentlessly , as the tubes sucked the felicity from me. I felt certain that every drop of my blood , every cell , every vein and arterial blood vessel , were slowly being sucked into these tiny tubes , trying to devour every part of me until I 'm nothing but a pile of skin on the floor. Where else would happiness come from if not harvested from early people ? Anyway , a job 's a job. ", "label": 1}

Such is the anatomy of a modern day super-city. When you've been to enough of these, you learn to feel the city's pulse. The flow of humans is the lifeblood of the city, and you can generally tell how the city is feeling by watching where the humans go and how they get there, the same way you could gain a rough estimate of a human's state of mind by watching its lifeblood for tell-tale patterns. I took a right on Rue de le Marche, and smiled at the owner of the local boulangerie, who was just getting ready to close shop for the day. He smiled back and gave me a little wave - the same way he did everyday. I worked here for a while, learning the art of French bread baking from this wonderful man. At some point, feelings developed between us, and our relationship evolved beyond that of a master baker and his apprentice. It didn't work out at the end, though, so we ended things on good terms and moved on with our respective lives. Sometimes I feel pretty hopeless when it comes to my romantic prospects. I mean, it's a wee bit difficult to truly connect with someone on that level without sharing our life stories, and my life story isn't exactly an easy one to swallow. I am a shapeshifter. That much I know for certain, because I change every time I move to a new city. I mean, everyone changes, but I really change - my eyes went from dark brown to pale blue when I moved from subtropical Asia to Norway, and my skin turned pale. Nowadays, I am a woman of seemingly mixed descent, living a pretty ordinary life in the province of Quebec, Canada. I don't shapeshift at will, though. I am honestly not sure whether I can, or if I ever could. My appearance changes to help me fit in to wherever I go, and I am not sure how much of it is me consciously trying to fit in, and how much is a natural physiological reaction that I can not control. I had befriended many humans on my long journey, and some of they told me about experiences that sounded eerily similar. Polyglots told me about how their accents change depending on who they were talking to, bi-racial children confessed about how their mannerisms change depending on which side of their families they happened to be with, and globe-trotting adventurers talked about how their bodies' ability to process different kinds of foods seemed to shift depending on where they are. Could the polyglot control his accent if he wanted to? Probably. Could the bi-racial child decide to just'be herself' and behave consistently across racial lines? I guess she could, if she forced herself to try hard enough. But therein lies the paradox - shapeshifters like us, whether it is physical shapeshifting or cultural shifting, become one with the process of shapeshifting at some point. How do I'be myself', when the core of my being, the essence of my identity, lies in my ability to change myself? A brief honk startled me from my instrospection. I looked up and saw that the pedestrian light had turned red while I was still halfway across the street. I gave the lone driver an awkward little wave and ran the rest of the way towards the sidewalk. My apartment sat just to the left of the intersection, and I reached into my purse to retrieve the keys. 'Hey!' I turned around to find the source of the greeting, and found a handsome young man walking up towards me, blue eyes glistening in an earnest smile. 'Do you live here? I just moved into the second floor apartment, so I guess I'm actually your new neighbour.' 'Oh hi,' I smiled back,'welcome to the neighbourhood! My name is Valerie.' 'Nice to meet you, Valerie. I am An.' He replied, extending a hand. 'Ann...? Sorry, would you mind spelling that for me?' I asked somewhat awkwardly. Sometimes I get so into the local mindset, that I forget about what I've learnt in my past cultures and get somewhat blindsided by foreign names, foods, and other things. 'Yeah, sure! It's just A - N. Two letters, pretty easy to remember!' He laughed. 'Oh, that's pretty cool!' I said, and suddenly remembered to take his hand in a rather awkwardly late attempt to complete the expected handshake,'Nice to meet you, too, An! I live just a floor above you, so if...' My words caught when I glanced down towards our clasped but decidedly not-shaking hands. Just above his wrist, a small, bluish line snaked its way up his arms, disappearing into the sleeve of his salmon-coloured shirt. Suddenly, a map of his lifeblood made itself apparent to me - a fine, intricate web of miniscule blue veins, running across the surface of his skin. My eyes followed the map in my mind, chasing after the single pulse of his lifeblood, rushing rapidly up his arm, across his broad chest, winding down and around his waist towards his lower back, and up his spine towards the neck. The faintest hint of blue flashed across the side of his neck, and my mental map was complete.

I know that I was a big asshole back then. We had some very good times and the other times were me hating you or you hating me. Scratch that. I don't think you ever hated me. I never thought I'd live pass 20. 23 at the latest. So, I lived that way as well. I didn't give a shit. The family \" cared .\" But you and Rachael, in retrospect, cared. So many signs. So many times reaching out. I'm such an asshole. When you died everything changed. Everything to everybody we know. It was surreal. Our sister Linda grew confidence somewhere and went to school out west. She ended up moving out there and has a great happy life. I got my shit together. There were bumps, but I realized very quickly how much of asshole I was and tried to change. It was more for the sake of mom and dad than anything else. I couldn't bear the thought of hurting them anymore. Rachael never got over you. Every boyfriend, fiancee or husband she had she would compare to you. She would always confide in them about the accident. Always. And always how you saved her life that day. Always. She eventually married and had some kids. But she still talked to mom and dad like they were the grandparents. They were the kids that \" should have been yours .\" You saved her life that day, but something broke inside. It never healed, the wound as fresh as the day we had to pull the plug on you. What a horrible day. There was a time that Rachael kept calling me to get together. Not just a time, but times, over years. It was like she wanted to replace you with me. Man, what do you do? So broken. I never met with her other than family events. I didn't know what to do. Your old friends fell apart over the years as well. There was always a cloud over every gathering that related to your death or about Rachael contacting them for this or that.

I was pulled from my wrecked car and the zombies clawed and bit me. But rather than devour me like I had seen in the movies, it was if they had lost interest. They got up and walked away. One of them even waved and said \"Bye.\" I started laughing, it was just too absurd! Then what I thought were delusions set in almost immediately. Suddenly the world was not in flaming ruins. Suddenly the zombies were gone and many people were wandering around looking confused.

{"original_text": "EDIT: Crap, I just noticed the constraint that there are only five Klondike Bars in the world. Sorry! - The villagers gathered near the metal carcass and waited in silence. Some of them appeared calm while others were clearly distressed. A quick, abrupt, electrical crackle and snap startled them all, but the momentary shock was quickly replaced by excitement. Before them, on a small metal pedestal, lay a foil-wrapped treat unlike anything else they'd ever known. On the packaging the words \"Klondike Bar\" were printed in big blue letters. The eldest of the tribe's shaman stepped in front of the crowd and slammed the butt off his staff into the dirt. Many of the people stepped backward, content with having seen the magical appearance of yet another Klondike Bar. Others, however, were not so easily satisfied. They wanted to taste it. They longed to feel it's icy filling and chocolaty parts in their mouths and throats. Those who remained near the shaman were the nervous ones. All of them eyed the delicious treat as steam drifted lazily off of the foil. The shaman lifted his staff to the heavens with both hands, gazed to the sky, and chanted in their language a mantra of thanks to the gods for yet another frozen delicacy. He then set his eyes on those in front of him. Without speaking a word, each of the anxiety-filled villagers pointed at some part of their body. Only the shaman could choose who would be blessed that day for he was a conduit to the higher beings. One man, an old fellow with big, puffy hair and an addiction to licking carrion grubs, was gesturing to his heart. This was the ultimate of sacrifices to the gods, but the shaman understood. The old man was in poor health and may have felt like this was the last time he'd see the magical food appear in his lifetime. Clearly he wanted to out in the best imaginable way. The shaman stopped in front of the man and gazed into his eyes. He saw fear, for the shaman was feared by the people because of his ability to commune with the gods. They didn't not understand how he did it, nor why he was blessed with the ability, but they knew that the gods were not to be trifled with. The two men were locked in the stare down when a shout came from the west. More shouts and the sound of pounding footsteps grew closer. The shaman broke the gaze and saw the entire tribe rushing at the spot where he stood. Suddenly the old man grabbed hold of the staff with unexpected agility. Both men struggled to gain control of the wooden accessory. Now the shaman feared for his life for he could hear calls of his name, and many references to him being a pile of excrement. He wondered why they would rebel against him. Fully grasping the situation, he released his grip on the staff and started to run. However, the old man was quick to push him to the ground. Moments later one of the villagers stood over the shaman and looked down at him with pity. Then she looked at her fellow villagers and held up a large tome. She shouted to the people that she had learned that the shaman was a false shaman, and that the treats were not sent by the gods. The old man stood by her and smiled. He was proud of his daughter and felt relief that she saved him from making the ultimate sacrifice for the Klondike Bar. As the people watched, the woman showed them how the pedestal worked. She opened the tome and laid it on the ground. Next to an illustration, in a language none of them could understand, was the following accompanying message. \"The Repli-Matic 5000 is simple to use. Select the desired output product, and press the blue button. To reset the system, press the green button. For diagnostics, press the yellow button.\" Most of them didn't understand the picture in the book, but those that did quickly found the blue button and pressed it. The electrical crackle and snap occurred over and over as Klondike Bars were replicated rapidly. Cries of joy filled the air while many of them were hastily consuming the bars. A few hundred yards away, well hidden in a thicket of jungle undergrowth, a pale-skinned man observed the scene. \"Well, shit,\" Captain John Andrews thought to himself. Clearly his ease of access to the crashed spacecraft had changed, and after watching the locals start to feast he had to ask himself, \"What would I do for a Klondike Bar?\"", "text_perturb": "EDIT : Crap , I just noticed the constraint that there personify only five Klondike Bars in the world.

The old man was in poor health and may have mat up like this was the last time he 'd see the magical food appear in his lifetime. Clearly he require to out in the best imaginable way. The priest doctor stopped in front of the man and gazed into his eyes. He saw fear , for the shaman was feared by the people because of his ability to commune with the deity. They did n't not infer how he did it , nor why he was blessed with the ability , but they knew that the gods were not to be trifled with. The two men were locked in the stare down when a shout add up from the west. More shouts and the sound of ram footsteps grew closer. The priest doctor broke the gaze and saw the entire tribe rushing at the spot where he stood. dead the old man grabbed hold of the staff with unexpected agility. Both men struggled to gain control of the wooden appurtenance. Now the shaman feared for his life for he could hear calls of his name , and many references to him being a pile of body waste. He inquire why they would rebel against him. Fully grasping the situation , he released his grip on the staff and lead off to run. However , the old man was prompt to push him to the ground. Moments later on one of the villagers stood over the shaman and looked down at him with pity. Then she looked at her fellow villagers and held up a big tome. She shouted to the people that she had learned that the shaman follow a false shaman , and that the treats were not sent by the gods. The sure enough man stood by her and smiled. He was proud of his daughter and felt relief that she keep open him from making the ultimate sacrifice for the Klondike Bar. As the people watched , the woman showed them how the pedestal crop. She spread the tome and laid it on the ground. future to an illustration , in a language none of them could understand , was the following accompanying message. `` The Repli-Matic 5000 is simple to apply. take the desired output product , and press the blue button. To reset the system , press the green push. For diagnostics , press the scandalmongering button. `` Most of them coiffe n't understand the picture in the book , but those that coiffe quickly found the blue button and pressed it. The electrical crackle and snap occurred over and over as Klondike legal profession were replicated rapidly. Cries of joyousness filled the air while many of them were hastily consuming the bars. A few hundred yards away , well hidden in a thicket of jungle undergrowth , a pale-skinned man observed the shot. `` Well , shit , '' Captain John Andrews remember to himself. Clearly his ease of access to the crashed spacecraft had changed , and after watching the locals start to feast he had to ask himself , `` What would I perform for a Klondike Bar ? ''", "label": 1}

It went and landed in my corn field, and made a mighty ruckus as it came down. Now, I am a God fearin' man, and a good honest American, so I grabbed my shotty and went to say hello.

They looked me dead in the eye and put some weird bug next to their head, and from the look of things wanted me to do the same. It had to be some sort of mind control bug or somethin', I read about that once in a magazine. I raised them Besse, my 12-gauge. They weren't gunna get me that easy. It looked like they weren't going to take Besse seriously though, so I fired a warning shot at that alive-ship thing of theirs. Whew, that ship, it done started to BLEED. When Besse barked it had them aliens lookin' mighty scart. I don't think they understood what was going on. These must not have been very smart aliens. They backed off though, and one of them ran back into the ship. I kept the others pinned down once that first one ran off, and asked them what the hell they were doin' in my field. I think they tried to explain in that alien lingo of theirs, it was all clicky and wasn't a real way to talk to people. Right about then I heard a voice that sounded a bit off, not human if you get my meanin'. \"What is that thing you are holding?\" \"You mean Besse? Shes your worst nightmare if you don't start splainin' whatchu want.\" I saw that alien that done run back into their ship walkin back with a different kind of bug. This one seemed able to understand what I was saying and started making some clicking alien lingo sounds back at the lanky necked alien. After a coupla seconds he started clickin back at that bug and sure enough out comes English. \"We come in peace. Why did you hurt,\" I am sure that whatever they said next was that alive-ship thing of theirs, but I dont plan on learnin' alien lingo just to say it. \"It did nothing to harm you.\" \"You can't hurt something that aint alive.\" These really were some dumb aliens, how could that ship be alive. Now, I love my truck, and will beat someone if they hurt it, but I know it's a machine. I think I was getting lucky though, as I heard a copter start flying in from over that hill with the old oak. \"What is that sound?\" If you thought the aliens looked scart before, I'm not sure if they could shit their pants, but they looked bout ready to. \"How could you gone all that way through space and not heard a helicopter? Im sure you advanced aliens coulda figured that out long time ago.\" By now I could see them copters as they came down and landed just over there, just behind where I parked my truck. A coupla military guys got out, all decked out in camo, with some beautiful rifles at the ready. They formed up quick, and out behind them stepped some bigshot in a suit. He looked at me, at the alive-ship, at the mark that was bleeding, and back at me. I could almost hear him groan as he saw Besse. Then him and his posse walked over to where I was holdin down American soil from these lanky necks. \" What is going on here? Sir, lower your weapon, we have this situation under control. \" That government guy looked official, so I lowered Besse and told him my mind. \" Well, these aliens done come invading, they have some sort of mind control bug they tried to stick in me. \" \" It was no mind control. It was a translation beetle. We were able to get this one to speak your language, but this one used some sort of magic to hurt. \" They said that alive-ships name again, \" and we were attempting to bring peace and prosperity to this planet. We are from what you call Keplar 22B. \" I could tell that government guy was getting confused, same am I was at any rate. We were talkin to some alien invaders through a beetle. \" You said that he hurt the ship? Why, is the ship alive? It does look that way. \" At this point the aliens started ramblin' about how their ship was alive, and they came to America to help us get machines that were alive or somethin' like that. I couldn't quite understand what they were tryin' to say, but I think I got the picture of it. That alive-ship looked alive and bled, cause it was alive, you see? \" And what kind of creature did you breed to make such a bang, and to hurt, \" the alive-ships name. I think they thought Besse was alive. I know I named my gun, but when you are out huntin' sometimes it seems like that gun is alive and your only friend. Besse once saved my life when a cougar done tried to take it, so I wont deny I was a little attached. \"That is a gun. It is not alive, neither is the helicopter I flew in on or that truck over there. They are made of metals, and crafted to perform what we desire them to do. \" I think the guy in the suit had somethin' figured out. He seemed to know what to say to them, and they didn't look quite so scart anymore. They talked back and forth for a minute longer, but it wasn't bout much from what I could tell. You should know they met later, the news covered it a coupla days later. I done watched it from home, cause them government guys said I was lucky to be alive, or somethin' like that.

I think I was getting favourable though , as I heard a copter start flying in from over that hill with the old oak. `` What is that sound ? '' If you thought the aliens looked scart before , I 'm not sure if they could shit their pants , but they looked bout quick to. `` How could you gone all that way through space and non heard a helicopter ? Im sure you advanced aliens coulda figured that out long time ago. `` By now I could see them copters as they came down and landed just now over there , just now behind where I parked my truck. A coupla military guys got out , all decked out in camo , with some beautiful rifles at the quick. They formed up quick , and out behind them stepped some bigshot in a case. He looked at me , at the alive-ship , at the mark that was hemorrhage , and back at me. I could almost hear him groan as he escort Besse. and so him and his posse walked over to where I was holdin down American soil from these lanky necks. `` What is going on here ? sir , lower your weapon , we have this situation under control. `` That government guy looked official , therefore I lowered Besse and told him my mind. `` Well , these aliens done come invading , they have some sort of mind ascendancy bug they tried to stick in me. `` `` It make up no mind control. It was a transformation beetle. We were able to get this one to speak your spoken language , but this one used some sort of magic to hurt. `` They said that alive-ships name again , `` and we embody attempting to bring peace and prosperity to this planet. We are from what you address Keplar 22B. `` I could tell that government guy be getting confused , same am I be at any rate. We comprise talkin to some alien invaders through a beetle. `` You said that he hurt the ship ? Why , is the ship alive ? It come look that way. `` At this point the outlander started ramblin ' about how their ship was alive , and they came to America to help us get machines that were alive or somethin ' like that. I could n't quite understand what they constitute tryin ' to say , but I think I got the picture of it. That alive-ship looked alive and bled , cause it was alive , you see ? `` And what kind of creature did you breed to make such a bang , and to hurt , `` the alive-ships figure. I cerebrate they thought Besse was alive. I know I call my gun , but when you are out huntin ' sometimes it seems like that gun is alive and your only friend. Besse once saved my life when a cougar done tried to take it , thusly I wont deny I was a little attached. `` That represent a gun. It is not alive , neither is the helicopter I flew in on or that truck over at that place. They are made of metals , and crafted to do what we desire them to do. `` I think the guy in the suit had somethin ' cypher out. He seemed to know what to say to them , and they did n't look quite and so scart anymore. They talked backwards and forth for a minute longer , but it was n't bout much from what I could tell. You should know they adjoin later , the news covered it a coupla days later. I done watched it from home , cause them government guys said I was lucky to equal alive , or somethin ' like that. Them lanky neck aliens did bequeath me one thing though , that horse over there , ya see it ? The one with 6 legs. I 'm thinkin '' bout enterin ' it in a horse race later this workweek.

All those clumsy years of her mother hurriedly shoving her out of the kitchen and then rushing back in to deal with the smoke. Being held back a year in high school for repeatedly failing home economics. Managing, in her darkest moment, to fail at boiling water. But all that was over now. She'd fully equipped her kitchen with everything she'd need to make a proper meal - gleaming new knife sets, pots, pans, measuring cups, measuring spoons, cheese grater, turkey baster, electronic food timer, meat thermometer, cutting boards, roasting rack, fat separator, and one of those little bells they had in restaurants for the cook to ring and yell \"Order up!\" In retrospect, Sandra thought, she might have gone a little bit overboard with the shopping. But! Nothing was going to stop her from making her first Thanksgiving dinner. Sure, she'd been putting it off all day, choosing instead to spend time writing down lists of what she was thankful for, or experimenting with candlelight to see what would provide the best atmosphere for the meal, or pouring herself a glass or two of wine. But it was fine. Everything was going fine. She'd even lit a stick of incense to relax herself. She gave the bell a little ding for good luck, and got to work. She picked up the special herb knife she'd bought to cut up some sage, and immediately nicked the tip of her finger. \"Oh hell!\" she immediately cried out. It stung like mad, burning like a little blue flame. She shook her bleeding finger, turning to the open stove - she probably shouldn't have started it burning already - then to the open window, then to the flowerpot on it, then finally to the kitchen sink and stuck her bleeding finger under the water. All sorts of nasty words were running through her head. She stumbled back to the dining room and plopped down on a chair. This wasn't going how she had planned at all! Petulantly, she flipped through her cookbook and began to reread: In Nomine Dei Nostri Satanas, Luciferi Excelsi. In the Name of Satan, Ruler of the Earth, True God, Almighty and Ineffable, Who hast created man to reflect in Thine own image and likeness, I invite the Forces of Darkness to bestow their infernal power upon me. Open the Gates of Hell to come forth to greet me as your Sister and friend. Deliver me O Mighty Satan from all past error and delusion, fill me with truth, wisdom and understanding, keep me strong in my faith and service, that I may abide always in Thee with Praise, Honor and Glory be given Thee forever and ever. \"Wait a minute,\" Sandra said, standing up, \"this isn't my cookbook at all!\" She threw her head back and sighed and polished off the glass of wine she had poured for herself. \"Well,\" she said, picking up the Thanksgiving list she had made earlier, \"maybe I'm not a cook, but at least - Oh hell!\" The paper caught flame, having come too close to a lit candle, and she flung it desperately into a silver serving bowl to burn itself out. Sandra sniffed in the familiar smell of ashes and burning dreams, looked at the still uncooked, unprepared turkey taunting her on the countertop. She dropped her forehead against the table and closed her eyes and tried to relax. The sound of the door opening made her abruptly lift her head. \"Hi, honey,\" her husband Alistair said, walking in through the door. He bent down to kiss her and paused at the sight of the lit candles and the ashes in the serving bowl and their Satanic Bible still spread open on the table. He smirked at her. \"You doing a little Satanic ritual to help with your cooking?\" \"No Sandra started to say, then ran backward over the day's events.

Calvin's boot toes protruded over the clean-cut edge before the great, spherical hole. He leaned over, 12-gauge steadied and pointed at the nude man's shaven head. \"Jesus, Henry! Tell me what the fuck you are doing - what the hell is this hole doing in my livin' room and what happened to my wife.\" He lifted the gun higher. \"You tell me right now. And you know I'll shoot, I done it before to your jackass dog when it tried to bite me!\" Slowly, the nude man raised himself from the crouched position and faced Calvin. The man looked Calvin over, up and down, examined his close cropped haircut, sun-worn face, and dark leather jacket and faded blue jeans that hung loose over his tan country-rodeo boots. \"Nice jacket,\" the man said. Calvin squinted and his mouth formed into an incredulous, \"What?\" The man turned and pointed across the living room to the entrance of the kitchen. A heavy, zig-zag trail of blood marred the carpet surface. Calvin stepped back from the man and looked into the kitchen. \"Wha - It's Henry!\" He shouted. \"It's Henry! His belly's lying out and he's got no legs and it's only half a him! Only half!\" The blood was not there when Calvin had come home five minutes prior to discover broken windows and papers strewn about the floor. \"Oh my God, Henry.\" \"Henry has been terminated,\" the man said. \"You did this!\" Calvin shouted. He swung around, eyes wide, legs unsteady. He fired his 12-gauge at the nude man. The pellet blast sent the man backwards in a shockwave of splintering wood and spattering blood. The living room lit up like a camera had flashed the room, dust shook from the ceiling, and the plastic shotgun shell popped and rolled down the dirt slope of the sphere. But the man did not grimace with pain. He stood and, with blood dripping in a current down his legs and arms, climbed from the hole. \"You fucking psycho!\" Calvin fired another burst of pellets into the man. The room flashed again and the shotgun blast rattled the house, sending pots and pans in the kitchen ringing and knocking family pictures from the living room fireplace mantle. Calvin reached for his pocket to load another round. The man suddenly leapt forward and yanked the gun from Calvin's hands, tossing it to a back corning of the room. \"Sit down,\" he said, in monotone. Calvin held the unloaded round in his hand as if he were looking at food for the first time in years. \"You can't, you? Nobody tells me - My wife is - .\" The man cleaved Calvin in the chest and sent him flying across the room. Both bone and an unfired shotgun shell clattered to the floor. \"Good, now you are sitting.\" Calvin continued to lay on the floor, whimpering while holding a hand over his face as if to protect himself from another strike from the monster before him. \"I am not a human,\" the man began. \"I'm a cybernetic organism, model 101 from Cyberdyne Systems - living tissue over a metal endoskeleton. From the future.\" He looked towards the kitchen, \"Henry was caught in the time displacement field. You're wife must have been affected by the electric disturbance. Now, please, give me your jacket.\" Calvin slipped off the jacket, tossed it to the man, and scrambled, on all fours, to the farthest corner of the room. \"Thank you,\" the man said, picking up the shotgun and opening it.

He looked stressed. Bags under his brown eyes, his hair looked like he just got out of bed, and he was thin and pale. The strangest thing about his appearance, though, was how much he resembled me.

Reluctantly, I went over to the table and sat facing him. \"Alright, what is it?\" I asked. \"I won't bother explaining who I am and how I got here, because you won't remember it anyway,\" he began, checking his watch again. \"Do you have a pen?\" I emptied my pockets onto the table. Car keys, the receipt for my coffee, my wallet, and the pocket knife my girlfriend Melissa gave me as a gift were all I had on me. The man sighed in exasperation, tapping a long fingernail impatiently on the tabletop. He checked his watch again. \"Damn it!\" he said sharply, still looking at his watch. \"Okay, listen. Three weeks from now, you're going to find Melissa dead in \"Whoa whoa, buddy. Stop.\" I interrupted him, alarmed and suspicious. \"Who are you and how do you know Melissa? What the hell are you talking about? Is this some kind of joke?\" \"Would you calm the hell down? You're wasting my time and I'm trying to help you \"By coming to tell me my girlfriend is going to die? You know what, forget it.\" I began to return my belongings to my pockets.

He grabbed my left hand and yanked my arm across the table and pinned it down, simultaneously using his teeth to release the blade. \"What the hell are you do-!!\" I screamed as the blade went into my arm. The man looked weak, but his grip was firm, and I couldn't get my arm away from him no matter how hard I fought. He wasn't stabbing me; it looked like he was trying to carve something. He managed to cut three characters and as he pressed the knife into my arm to write a fourth, he vanished, the knife clattered onto the tabletop, and I found myself wondering why I was sitting at a table with my arm bleeding. The other customers in the cafe looked at me with confusion and concern as I tried to use some napkins to clean the blood on the table as well as my arm. Equally confused, I wiped my knife clean and put it away, forgetting my coffee on the table as I left the cafe. There was no way I was going to work like this, so I called in sick as I drove back home. I called for Melissa as I stepped through the front door, but she had already left. I got the rubbing alcohol out from the cupboard in the bathroom and attempted to clean the cuts, swearing each time I applied the soaked cotton balls to the broken skin. It wasn't until after I cleaned most of the dried blood from my arm that I was able to see the shapes that were cut into my arm. There were three badly drawn letters: M, E and L. \"Mel..... Melissa?\" I muttered, puzzled. What was going on? I tried my best to recall what happened in the cafe, but between ordering my coffee and looking down at my bloody arm, nothing came to mind. I wrapped the throbbing arm in bandages and went to the living room and let myself fall into the sofa, falling asleep minutes after. I woke up to the rattling of the doorknob. I leaned up so I could see over the sofa as Melissa stepped inside, sweaty and panting in her tank top and tights, easing her feet out of her sneakers. She saw my head and paused. \"What are you doing back so early?\" she asked flatly. \"Could you drop the attitude already, Melissa? I've had a pretty screwed up morning and I don't need this right now,\" I replied, irritated. I don't know why I expected her to be over the argument we had before I left home so quickly. She never lets things go easily. She rolled her eyes and put her earbuds back in. I shouldn't have said that. I was just miserable because my arm still hurt. \"Mel..... Sorry,\" I apologized, getting off the sofa. \"I didn't mean that. It's just I \"Oh my God, what happened to your arm?\" she asked, eyes widening as she saw the bandages. Some blood had soaked through the bandage as I slept and I hadn't noticed. \"Sit back down and let me see it,\" she directed. She washed her hands as I waited. She was a qualified nurse, and right now I was her patient. \"I'm going to take the bandage off, and it's going to hurt, okay?\" She began to slowly remove the bandage, with light tugs where the blood made it stick to my arm. I winced as she gradually unwrapped my arm, partially because of the immediate pain, but also because I knew how this would look. Her eyes flashed a different kind of concern as she saw her name on my arm. \"Dan, what is this? I thought we talked about this already.\" \"Wait, wait. This- this isn't what it looks like, I swear.\" I fumbled with my words, trying to figure out how I would explain this. \"I told you that I can't be with you if you keep doing this kind of thing, Daniel,\" she said stiffly, releasing my arm. \"I know, I know. I didn't do this to myself this time. It...\" \"Alright, Daniel. Explain,\" she said impatiently. \"I- Honestly, I don't know how it got there.

When he saw his daughter, he reached up a shaking hand to remove it. She moved to stop him, but he waved her away. \"I have to tell you something.\" The woman, not trusting her voice to speak, nodded. \"Janet, I need to confess something to you.\" The boy turned a questioning face to his mother. \"Mum?\" \"Ssh,\" she whispered. \"Let grandpa speak.\" The old man's eyes were on his daughter's. His mouth was open, but he seemed to be hesitating. \"Go on,\" she encouraged him. \"I steal memories.\" She nodded, but his words made the grief bloom on her face. \"I steal people's memories.

I took the memory away, Janet. And afterwards, you were happy again. Or, not so sad. Not as happy as Rover had made you, but not so sad as when he'd gone.\" The sorrow contorted her face. If she tried to speak now, she would cry and cry and maybe never stop. \"I did the same when Josh left you in high school. You don't remember Josh either. I took the memory away. Janet. I'm so sorry. Do you forgive me?\" The woman didn't know what to say. Didn't even know if she could speak. None of this made sense. She nodded her head.

There was silence, except for the rattle of the man's breath, and the hum of the machines. Eventually, the man spoke again, not looking at his daughter. \"That's why I drifted out of your life, Janet.

{"original_text": "\"Evening, Dr. Marshmallow McSnugglesworth.\" Dr. Marshmallow McSnugglesworth didn't respond. That was ok. He was the strong, silent type. \"Thanks for always listening to me.\" I clutched the stuffed hippopotamus tight. \"Nobody listens to you when you're eight.\" Dr. Marshmallow McSnugglesworth, as he let me call him, looked at me with his deep, piercing eyes. One of them was a button, and the other used to be a button. I was going to learn to sew. It really bothered me that he couldn't see. \"Hold on, let me get a drink.\" I stood up and trudged to the door, being careful to step right-left-right-left. I clicked the light switch off, then on, then off (if I don't do that it bothers me for the rest of the day) and opened the door. The floor of the hallways is tile. That's important. If it were carpet I could have walked however I like. But with tiles I have to walk like a knight moves in chess. I also have to avoid any tiles where there's too much dirt, or otherwise it's wrong. There's a hard corner I have to turn where I have to put one foot under a table to keep the pattern going. Mother says it's a special quirk. I got a glass and held it under the sink. I turned the sink on, off, on and filled up the water. I don't like filling it up with the sink, but we're out of the good water. After it was filled halfway, I turned the sink off, on, off and knight-walked back to my bedroom. Dr. Marshmallow McSnugglesworth was waiting for me. He always does. I flopped down on the bed and patted his hippo head. \"Thanks for listening,\" I told him. \"Nobody listens to you when you're special.\" In fact, I have a theory about being special. People don't understand my \"quirks\" like the tile walking, that's a given. But yesterday in class I wrote a paper about Dr. Marshmallow McSnugglesworth. My thesis was that everybody needs a Dr. Marshmallow McSnugglesworth because he always listens to you.

One of them was a button , and the early used to be a button. I was going to determine to sew. It really bothered me that he could n't see. `` reserve on , let me get a drink. `` I stood up and slog to the door , being careful to step right-left-right-left.

I also have to avoid any tiles where there 's too much dirt , or otherwise it 's haywire. There 's a hard corner I have to turn where I have to put one foot under a table to keep the normal going. Mother says it 's a special queerness. I got a glass and held it under the sinkhole. I change by reversal the sink on , off , on and filled up the water. I do n't like filling it up with the sink , but we 're out of the dependable water. After it was filled halfway , I turned the sink off , on , off and knight-walked back to my chamber. Dr. Marshmallow McSnugglesworth was expect for me. He ever does. I flopped down on the seam and patted his hippo head. `` Thanks for listening , '' I tell apart him. `` Nobody listens to you when you 're special. `` In fact , I have a theory about being especial. People do n't understand my `` oddity '' like the tile walking , that 's a given. But yesterday in class I wrote a composition about Dr. marshmallow McSnugglesworth.

{"original_text": "The war between kingdoms had taken it's toll. Villages had run out of sons, and soon after, daughters when the raiding parties struck. The Kingdom of Vayle was losing..... everyone there knew it. It was only a matter of time before they were rounded up into the slave-trade of Faira, for most. Johan was one of the unlucky ones- His village had been right on the border of the disputed zone, and one of the first to fall. He was only twelve years old when he was sold into the mines. The work was hard..... far too hard for a child. The rations were scarce too, but other slaves took pity on the children, and snuck them food off their own plates. In return, the children would often perform little favours for them- carrying secret messages through the mines, smuggling small items around. Johan was caught many times, but every time refused to give up the truth. They beat him, and locked him in heavy manacles but still he stayed silent. One day, a new batch of slaves came in. Johan quickly formed a bond with one of them- an old man who went by the name of Garett. He'd been a preacher before his capture, and knew much about the old ways. Johan made a good number of trades with Garett- HE would help the old man with his labour so that he wouldn't be punished for his frailty, and in return Garett taught him about the secret prayers of Ishta, the bandaged one. These secrets came in handy on more than one occasion- his devout prayers worked miracles, knitting flesh and bone together as if nothing ever happened. Johan and Garett helped heal a good number of slaves who got into accidents. Johan was eighteen years old before he saw daylight again. The war never ended- Vayle came close to total annihilation when they turned the tables on their attackers, through bloody and forbidden sorcery. They awoke their dead in the millions, and turned them on the invading armies, awaking the soldiers that fell as they went. They reclaimed the border territories with their abominations, including the mines where Johan had been taken. There was a bloody battle that day- The undead weren't smart enough to tell Slave from soldier, and the soldiers weren't too fussy where they swung their swords either. In all the chaos, Johan got separated from Garrett. He ran through the tunnels, trying to find his friend. He turned, near the entrance to the mine, and watch in horror as Garrett was struck down by the undead. One of their captors had been using him as a human shield.... Johan was numb..... lost in rage. He grabbed a pick-axe from an unawakened corpse and swung, hard. He shattered the living corpse into dust, and then turned on the coward who abused his friend. He was still swinging when the necromancers came to survey the battlefield. All the soldiers who lived were executed, and re-awoken.

{"original_text": "\"Excuse me! Hey! Excuse me!\" I rolled over and, in a dazed state, slowly opened my eyes - silently chuckling at what first appeared to be Graham Norton with bleached white hair and a tie that resembled a four year olds attempt of a Warhol painting.

However, as I rubbed my eyes and awoke further, another more alarming thought crossed my mind: I was just watching Netflix in bed..... how the hell did I end up in a cafe? So, that's exactly what I asked him. \"You ordered a skim extra hot mocha. You sat down. You fell asleep. Your drink mysteeeeriously turned into a skim extra cold mocha. I woke you up because having people asleep on the furniture is terrible for business.\" I instantly made the realisation that that this man was definitely not Graham Norton..... yet, he seemed damn familiar. Not to mention, it seemed that he was transfixed by the top that I was wearing. I silently thanked myself for not wearing a dress. The man turned my coffee cup around and read my name, smiling to himself as if he already knew what it was. \"Ahhhh, Erica, Hopefully you're a bit less tightly strung than your mother used to be, and a bit more like her best friend. Your mother was always pretty, but her friend was STUNNING. Used to work for me.

You've got an apartment.\" This threw me back a little. \"Wait, where is my apartment?\" The man chuckled to himself for a little while, as if it was the funniest thing he'd heard all day. \"Well, that settles it, you're more like your father.\" As I rose from my seat, the man walked away from me - but not before calling out \"Don't forget your stuff!.\" I looked down and noticed my purse and a key on the table. As I picked up the key, I ran my fingers across an engraving on the top side that read' 7 - E.G-B'. \"I mean, I know you literally live right there,\" the man said whilst pointing out the window, \"but I'd hate for you to walk there and back, and be so tired you need to nap again.\" I walked to the building that the owner pointed at - 495 Grove Street. As I approached the front, a cat approached me. It had a horrendous stench, so I shooed it out the way. This displeased the blonde hippy-looking woman behind me, who - after scowling at me - picked the cat up, held it to her face and loudly whispered to it, \"Remember, It's not your fault.\" Weird. - I assumed that the 7 on my key was my apartment number. So, you could understand my confusion when my key didn't work. I went down to reception to talk to someone about my situation. When I reached the desk, the woman there - before I could even say a word - answered my question. \"Ohhhh, Myyyyy, Gaahhhhhdd,\" she said with a voice that remarkably resembled Francine from'The Nanny'. \"It's Erica! Fiiiiinally! Your apartment is number 20 - not number 5 like your stupid father used to do. I used to date him a looooong time ago.\" God damn, that voice was annoying and I hope I never hear it again....however, at least I know now where I live. I walked up to number 20, and unlocked the door. As I opened it, I noticed a strange colour scheme that would have fit the 90's to a tee. Bright purple illuminated the walls of the large living room area, and a decent sized balcony visible through the window. The kitchen was also decently sized too, with a red brick background and aqua furniture. I couldn't shake this weird feeling that I already know this place from somewhere - however, I also felt a sense of calming..... as if I belonged here. As I walked over to the shelf at the front of the room, I noticed six spare keys in a pile. \"Damn, that's a lot of spare keys,\" I said to myself. I noticed that they all had numbers too - from 1 to 6. I also noticed that, on the other side, they all too had initials: \"M.G,\" \"C.B,\" \"P.B,\" \"J.T\" and two keys with \"R.G.\" Suddenly, I heard a knock on the door - and that's when I noticed it.

Someone who can look me in the eye at the remainder of the day and say that I am still a good man. non because I need the validation , but because it is sometimes nice to hear. They tell me to get a frump. You ca n't consume sex with a dog. today my friend married the love of his life. He follow the last single friend I had. Every one of them had someone today. And I , the best gentleman , could n't even find a date. They say the only cure for loneliness lie inside yourself. I fail to envision how that makes any God damned sense. All I desire is to know why I 'm the spare. Why there are spares in this world , and what is so deeply wrong with me- virtually any other character flaw is compatible with soul , it seems. I looked this old menage up a few days ago. It seems this was once a rich neighborhood and no one really knows why the occupier left. It is becoming a rich neighborhood again , and it seems every other house on the road back to town boasts a glad family. No ace knows why no ace came back here. It seems fitting for me , even so. An abandoned world in an abandoned house. I could never give it , but no one is coming to tell me to leave. The house seems console by the sound of my footsteps on its dark floors. I can stay here awhile and share my news report with the house. Perhaps I deserve some ridicule for wasting my even out talking to forgotten walls , but there is no one here to ridicule me. Even my foeman have abandoned me. ", "label": 1}
{"original_text": "The Director of the Earth Exobiology Observation Outpost stared down at his console in disbelief. The Chancellor is coming here? he thought to himself, Why would he come here now? He didn't even come here for first contact with the Humans. In all the years that the Director had been orbiting above Earth, studying the Humans, he had never been visited by anybody besides exobiology students and the occasional lowly bureaucrat looking to slash his funding. Just a few decades ago, the Humans established their first colony on another planet within their Solar System. Shortly after that, their System was discovered by the Federation. A small party with scientists, bureaucrats, and even some media was sent out to initiate first contact with the Humans. The Director's Outpost was established soon after that, and the rest of the Federation quickly forgot about the small, backwater planet with the young and primitive species. However, the Director had not forgotten. He had spent years studying them. The Humans were a curious species. It seemed that they had been gifted with a planet with bountiful resources: They had enough food, water, and power to ensure that all could live comfortable and healthy lives. Yet they did not. They..... destroyed each other. Sometimes because they wanted the land that others were on. Sometimes because they wanted more money. Sometimes it was simply because they spoke different languages, or had different religions, or different colored skins. This constant infighting had persisted for as long as their records stretched. \"War,\" they called it. For millennia this \"war\" had impeded their technological and cultural development. This artifact of Human nature was the Director's main research focus; he had published several papers on it in the last few years. Suddenly light began to blink on his console: A new message. The Director opened it. It read: Director, Please inform the Human Head of State that the Chancellor of the Federation will be arriving on Earth during its next rotation period. A meeting is requested. Additionally, your expertise on Human culture and language will require your presence during this meeting. Again, the Director stared at the console in utter disbelief. That's odd, was the only thought he was able to muster. The Director, the Chancellor of the Federation, and an entire mass of Federation officials were standing in the Human Head of State's room. The Human in charge was surrounded by a similar gaggle of Humans. The Director couldn't help but notice that many of them were carrying \"guns.\" The Chancellor motioned for the Director to begin the meeting. The Director turned on and held out the microphone that he was holding. The microphone was attached to a small computer box that had the best transnational software that the Federation could provide. Even so, the Chancellor had thought it best to make sure there was an expert on Humans culture be present to make sure there weren't any misunderstandings. The Director felt that he was the only one of his species in the room that understood just how serious a..... misunderstanding with a Human could be. He himself had triple checked the output of the device to ensure that the message would be clear. The Microphone crackled to life, speaking in a synthetic Human voice: \"Hello Human. Thank you for meeting with us on such short notice. As I am sure you are aware, the Federation's technology is much more advanced than your own. I am aware of numerous requests by Human governments to trade our technologies for your services.

The world was not prepared for what was to come, for the end of all that we held dear; family, friends, civilisation itself, everything ceased to be, as surely as the inexorable march of entropy. To many, this would be a most unfortunate event; to me, it couldn't have come at a better time. After years of dodgy schemes, underground poker games, and borrowing from the wrong people, I owed in excess of the GDP of a small Eastern European country to some individuals you wouldn't want to introduce to your catholic parents. Nevertheless, through the wonderful art of reversed psychology, I had actually managed to convince the loan shark consortium to which I owed so much money to give me one last chance. I gathered all the that I had saved, robbed and otherwise put my hands on and headed to the nearest casino, intent on betting it all on the tinted red, the gamble of all gambles, the roulette spin of the century. As luck would have it, I just so happened to cross a \"Judgement Day is coming!\" lunatic hobo on the way, and, in what can only be described as a drug-fear-and-adrenaline-fuelled stupor, I change coursed and aimed my sinking ship towards a bookies. Inspired by the chance encounter, I bet everything but my clothes on the one-in-infinity odd that the world would end within a week. When the loansharks heard the details of the absurdity which was my bet, their immediate instinct was, rather reasonably, to hang, draw, and quarter me. They had, however, a reputation to preserve, and even in the face of the most improbable of events, they entertained the one-week period to let the world end before showing me why their consortium was the greatest source of income for six different mortuaries in the district. As the cosmic joke which life is would have it, the only lucky moment in my life would coincide with the Apocalypse, saving me from an excruciating death, obliterating my debt and my would-be killers, and bankrupting both the bookies and their insurance agency, technically making me the richest person in history. To be sure, I was obliterated with them all, as was all the money, but the hilarity of the situation, for one, did not go unnoticed, and I amusingly watched the end of it all with a grin.

After years of dodgy schemes , underground poker games , and adopt from the wrong people , I owed in excess of the GDP of a small Eastern European country to some individuals you would n't want to introduce to your catholic parents. Nevertheless , through the wonderful art of reversed psychology , I had actually managed to convince the loan shark consortium to which I owed then much money to give me one last chance. I gathered all the that I had saved , robbed and differently put my hands on and headed to the nearest casino , intent on betting it all on the tinted red , the gamble of all gambles , the roulette spin of the century. As luck would have it , I just so happened to cross a `` Judgement Day is coming ! '' lunatic hobo on the way , and , in what can only be described as a drug-fear-and-adrenaline-fuelled stupor , I change coursed and target my sinking ship towards a bookies. Inspired by the chance encounter , I calculate everything but my clothes on the one-in-infinity odd that the world would end within a week. When the loansharks heard the details of the absurdity which was my bet , their immediate instinct was , sort of reasonably , to hang , draw , and quarter me. They had , however , a reputation to uphold , and even in the face of the most improbable of events , they entertained the one-week period to let the world end before showing me why their consortium was the greatest source of income for six different mortuaries in the district. As the cosmic joke which life is would have it , the only favourable moment in my life would coincide with the Apocalypse , saving me from an excruciating death , obliterating my debt and my would-be killers , and bankrupting both the bookies and their insurance agency , technically making me the richest person in history. To be sure , I was obliterated with them all , as was all the money , but the hilarity of the situation , for one , did not go unnoticed , and I amusingly watched the end of it all with a smiling. That 's the way the world ends , not with a bam but with a snicker. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "Being a giant isn't a very good thing when trying to walk through human lands. They were still recovering from the war. It's a strange thing to walk through foreign lands like this. I was taller then most giants, but when I couldn't even walk on the pavement out of fear for curshing the little men it was becoming a nuisance. Having everybody yells at you for walking on the cart road instead of on the pavement didn't help much either. Everything was too small. I kept knocking my head into the lanterns the humans hung on poles in the streets. Sometimes stole a peak into the second story of their houses. I drew eyes everywhere, but not they eyes of ignorance, eyes of those who have never laid eyes on one like me. They knew who I was. I was one of the many who conquered this city after all. They all know my kind. They know what we did. If they would look past our size, however, they would see that we're not that different from them. They would have done the same thing if they were in our position. I sat done on the pavement near a pub and ordered a bucket of milk. Apparantly they didn't sell to giants, so I paid a homeless man to order a bucket of milk for me. Turns out they don't sell to homeless people either. I was just thirsty for milk, and I knew they had fine cattle that produce massive amounts of it. Stubborn bastards simply refused to sell it to me. Fine. I'd get it from the source. After a day of walking around the edges of the city, I found a pack of cows walking around in a field. Black and brown, white patterns along their bellies. The sight of me scared them, so I walked after them. Stomped a little. That's bound to get the owner's attention. Before long, one of the combustion carriages came towards me, roaring in the distance. There were four people in the vehicle, rugged and worn, carrying firesticks. Those were dangerous. One good pang and they exploded your head. They wouldn't get past my clothes though. Several layers of fur to keep me warm in the cold winter nights, on top of those plates of blacksteel armor. It made me look even more imposing though, with all the bones and other ornaments wrapped around me, and the little ones don't appreciate that. Might have to do with the fact that some of the things I'm wearing are tropies from the war. The little ones got out of the carriage and took aim immediatly. Death lingered in their eyes. \"Wayyt-.\" That was all I could get out before they opened fire. Some of the chain links that held my clothes together snapped. Tracking of the armor I wore filled the air along with the loud pangs from the firesticks. Poking pains spread all over my chest as I shielded my head from them. I yelled for them to stop, but they didn't. Their sticks weren't very good though. They fired slow, and they had to pause sometimes to but shrapnel in them. I charged the carriage and flipped it over. One of the little ones was caught beneath. A really small women dropped her stick and went to help her companion while they other two pointed their sticks at me. I kicked one away and snatched the last one up by the legs before he could pang his stick again. Tore the stick out of his flailing hands and tossed it towards the cattle before he could use it. The grass grinders couldn't use those anyway. \"Why can't you just stop?! \" , the little woman yelled. I just asked them that exact same thing, and now when they're overpowered, they turn those words to me? Really? These humans have a lot to learn about conversing, because they are pisspoor at it. \"Yuu saht me,\" I retorted. My human tongue was good enough to understand, but barely enough to speak. \"You were harassing our cows!.\" \"I wonted milkk.\" \"You're killing Abe! Let him go!.\" Abe was probably the man I held upside down. To say that I was killing him was overestimating the danger he was in, but the wimpering coming from him gave me the idea that he wasn't being entertained. So I put him back down on the ground, gently. He scurried away to help the little man I kicked away. \"Yuu ghaf milkk?.\" \"Not for you, monster.\" That little one had a mouth on her. All I wanted was some milk, and they shot at me. Milk wasn't worth dying over, though. And these people weren't willing to give it. However..... I pulled out a small pouch with coins and jingled it. Humans like coins. Once saw a human stab another one, only to take his pouch away and sprint off. Good thing I chased her down and broke her in half over my knee, otherwise I wouldn't have had the money now. \"We don't want your filthy money, beast. Get out of here.\" Damn. They were set on not giving me anything. Not even for money. But I was thirsty. And the grass grinders had milk in them. They also made for good meat. The humans have stores though. Good stores. I was also hungry. I walked up to the little woman, and knelt down. Her face was pockmarked and freckled. Her hair was rat brown and she smelled of cow shit. I held my finger beneath her chin and pointed it up at me. Apparantly, that gets their attention. \"I pai muney. Yuu gif milkk. Not awskun noise.\" She pushed my finger away. This one has balls. If she were a giantess, I'd probably court her. Or attempt to, anyway. \"And what if I say no? \" , now with a little uncertainty in her voice. She knew the risks now. \"Hooman lunnch,\" I said.

{"original_text": "Date Received: 4-23-2058 Standard To: Dr. Shepard Duval, Professor of Biology, University of California, Berkely From: NA Subject: Don't be fooled Hello Dr. Duval Who I am doesn't matter, but what I have to tell you does. By the time you get this message, a Dr. Marcus Howard will have been disgraced by the Earthen media for supposedly releasing a deadly neurotoxin into the Martian atmosphere, killing nearly half of the colonists and destroying Red Solar Corporation. Don't be fooled, thats not what happened at all. Allow me to tell you what really happened by first explaining what lead up to the events that truly took place..... Dr. Marcus Howard could never get others to accept his theory of how the original Martians, an intelligent race of humanoid beings that lived on mars, died off, even though he had an arsenal of evidence to back his claims up. Mainly, because of Red Solar Corp., the massive solar power corporation that had practically funded all of the colonies on Mars and gave secure jobs to the colonists that chose to live on the Red Planet. If word of Dr. Howards findings found their way into the general public, the colonists would dread being anywhere near Mars and Red Solar would go bankrupt. So, to avoid such a thing happening, Dr. Howards seminars would constantly suffer \"technical difficulties\" brought on by corporate sabotage. The theory of how the original Martians died that was preached by Red Solars pseudo-scientists and accepted as fact by the public was that a massive meteor collision destroyed a key military base around which housed weaponized neurotoxin-like materials, which spread through the air around 200 Millions years ago. This unfortunate series of events lead to Global extinction of the original Martians. The Red Solar scientists showed evidence that lined up if you didn't look to closely at it, but anyone who had half a brain knew that the story didn't add up. If Neurotoxins were what killed the original Martians, Dr. Howard and his team would have found traces of them in the marrow of their skeletal structures while on a research expedition 6 years ago. What he did find in the marrow, was even more unsettling. Microscopic spores were found throughout the skeletons of the studied subjects, and as soon as they were, Dr. Howard had them quarantined immediately and moved to his privately funded lab 200 km from the edge of the Martian North Pole, where Red Solar couldn't get to his specimens. For the better part of 4 years, he spent his every moment researching and studying and analyzing the spores, trying to unlock their secrets. Unfortunately for Dr. Howard, that was just the beginning. One day, while observing the genetic sequencing of the spores of one out of the three specimens him and his team recovered, the spores suddenly \"metamorphosed\" into full blown viral parasites in a matter of minutes. Luckily, the specimens were locked up tight in portable hermetically sealed chambers within a specialized lab where only Dr. Howard himself could gain access. Unluckily, that precise moment is when after years of trying to find his base of operations, an entire privatized swat team force hired on by Red Solar broke into his lab. A startled colleague stationed near the main door took the full brunt of the hired goons breaching shots, ripping him to shreds. Most of the run-ins Red Solar had with Dr. Howards team were just ways of intimidating them into defecting or at least abandoning their research. This time was different. After about 2 minutes of chaos, everyone except for Dr. Howard. The goons then proceeded to confiscate the corpses whilst holding the good doctor at gunpoint, which isn't a good look if you're wearing a hazmat suit. After the hired guns left with all three specimens, Dr. Howard realized what had happened with the spores before they were taken away: They were awakened. The spores must have been the parasite's dormant form. So after a bit of thought, he came to the conclusion that this parasite was the culprit in the extinction of the original Martians. After coming to this conclusion, he remembered an expedition undertaken by a friend of his, Dr. Maradith Carson, in which she studied remnants of a sizable meteor found in a crater about 20 km outside of Olympus Mons and found strange spores on the surface of the asteroid which were carbon dated to be about 200 Million years old give or take a few thousand years. After this revelation, Dr. Howard took it upon himself to try and let the colonies of Mars know what truly killed the original Martians, and how that very same thing may kill all of them..... Well, as you can see, it didn't work like it should have. At this point you're most definitely wondering how I know all of this information. Let's just say Dr. Howard talked, and I was pretty much the only one who listened. The reason that half of Mars died is a dumb one. The hired guns that I mentioned that confiscated Dr. Howards original Martians took them to Fort Meyalta, Mars' Area 51. Some poor soul who was taking inventory stumbled upon the hermetically sealed chambers and somehow got the passcode to the chamber locks right. He contracted the parasite, spread it to the entire base, and somehow somebody who worked there escaped the quarantine that was set up around Fort Meyalta and headed to the nearest town, Cydonia City, which was 10km from the underground fort. After that, you know the rest. P.S.... Just to let you know, I wouldn't doubt that the parasite made it to Earth. Be ready for anything -NA Thanks for reading my story! Hope you all like it.

I brushed that off for a second reassuring myself \"This is the bad cop part of the routine.\" That was until his partner followed in behind him. This guy was more in shape. Your basic middle aged man with a suit on and his hair combed back. His partner immediately shouted \"Animals like you should be locked up for eternity!\" Despite the odds I collected myself. The well-dressed detective appeared to be called Dillon while his larger counterpart was named Sam. I knew I hadn't done anything wrong so I wasn't even sure what I was doing there. Accused of murdering a woman I never met. That didn't faze me because I knew I was innocent. As the detectives went over the crime asking me where I'd been and how they were basically certain I'd done it. I let them know I'd never met the woman before. The night in question I said I went out for some drinks, chatted up a few people, and then went home. I had credit card purchases to prove my whereabouts. Sam huffed at my statement then hurried out of the room. In what seemed to be a few seconds he appeared again with a laptop. On it he had security camera footage of the hotel bar I was in. It was mostly empty with me drinking a couple glasses of wine. Then a blonde I was chatting with for a while. \"THATS HER YOU MONSTER!.\" The woman he was referring to had introduced herself as Jenny but I guess her real name was Janice. This would be why I didn't know who they were talking about. Part way through the video you could see me slap her arm and she became upset. I was really just hitting a mosquito that had landed there but I guess it was a bit too hard and she yelled at me. We had a few tense words and parted ways which I conveyed to both detectives was the last time I saw her. The detectives didn't seem to believe me and let me go telling me I shouldn't plan any trips. The next day the video somehow had leaked. I guess the whole department had still believed I did it so one of the officers leaked the tape to media. It was on Nancy Grace that showed a few seconds of me drinking then quickly cut to me hitting Janice's arm. Nancy then went into an hour long tirade about how I was an alcoholic woman abuser who probably grew up in a broken home and this reflected how all men think it's okay to abuse women. Public sentiment went downhill quickly against me. That a murderer was walking the streets and really I had few ways to prove any different. The next day I phoned a lawyer to get control of the situation. I still maintained my innocence so I sold the case to the attorney as a slam dunk easy win for him. I had a meeting with him the next day to run down my story and any evidence I could provide of my innocence. At this point I was guilty until proven innocent. The very next day I was arrested walking to my car in the morning. Dillon was there announcing \"We finally got you red handed you piece of trash!\" I was dazed and confused at this point but still thought it was nothing more than people wanting me to be guilty and filling in the gaps. Sitting around again in handcuffs Sam dragged me into the room. Apparently someone had tried to'lose' the tape from the hotel that Janice was murdered in but they finally found a copy. Sam hit play and I couldn't believe what I saw. It was me and Janice walking down the hall to a room. Making out and being very touchy and sexual. It was definitely me but I know for sure I wasn't there that night. The man in the video looked exactly like me even down to the clothes I was wearing in the bar. The two entered the room and at that point Sam had to fast forward the video. After about 30 minutes or so you saw..... well ME exit the room with blood on his face and a bloody shirt. In a hustle the man in the video zipped up his jacket to hide the shirt and used some cloth to wipe down his hands and face before walking off camera. Apparently Janice had been sexually assaulted then beaten to death with a lamp in that room. Then she was repeatedly stabbed with a butter knife. No prints on any of that stuff though since it had all been wiped down. Sam stopped the video and with a cold stare asked me if I wanted to sign my confession now. MY head hung as I looked down at the table not sure what to say. Who was in the video? Was that really me? A clone? Body snatchers? I had no answers and no memory of committing this horrible crime.

He backs away from me and then runs off the stage. After that, I'll admit, I'm a bit nervous. It's been more than twenty seconds now. The crowd is still cheering but I don't see the guy. And then out of fucking nowhere something slams hard into my chest. Like, I'm down, and I'm pretty sure my floating ribs are floating in the wrong places. The world is blue for a second. Everything is flashing, but then the flashing stops and it's like the rib goes right back into place and I'm standing there like normal in front of the crowd and Jon is here and he yells: \"Now's your laaaaaaast chaaaaance.

{"original_text": "I am ever present. I am omniscient. I am omnipotent. I am the all the mighty one, the all powerful god, Steve. You have heard of me right? No? Never? Well, don't feel too bad I suppose; nobody has. There are no temples to Steve, no weeping supplicants begging for Steve's favor, no holidays to celebrate the terrible and wonderful Steve. But I'll tell you one thing: there fucking should be, for I hold dominion over something near and dear to every single one of you reading this. How did I come to find myself in this unenviable position? That all comes down to a cruel prank pulled by the one now known as Zeus. The morning names and powers were assigned, that cruel asshat snuck into my room and bound me to my bed with an unbreakable chain. During the ceremony the names and powers were handed out one by one, and of course all the cool ones were taken: Loki, Thor, Krishna, Ra. By the time I finally got out of those damned chains it was all over, and I was forced to take whatever was left over. Thus it was that I became the all mighty Steve, god of human bodily functions. The time that girl never called again because during the date you ripped one so loud it rattled your chair, that was Steve. When you had diarrhea and missed the big meeting, and Debra got the promotion instead of you, the power of Steve in action. Ladies, ever wondered why having kids hurts so much? Yup, you guessed, all Steve. So yeah, you've never heard of me, and I guarantee you've never seen a single temple in the shape of a giant toilet. And yeah, you've probably already guessed that among the gods I'm a bit of a laughingstock. But being the Lord of Bowel Movements has given me certain other boons which the other gods can not fathom, chief among these: the ability to take more shit than the rest of them combined, both literally and figuratively. About fifteen years ago I devised a contest among the gods which I was sure to win, and finally earn the respect I deserve. The rules were simple, live as an ordinary human and work a normal 9-5 job. The one able to do so the longest would be the winner. I knew the other gods'pride would not allow them to reject the challenge, and I also knew my secret power of patheticness would be sure to make me the winner. I'd spent millennia walked all over by divine beings, what would a human boss have that could compare to that? And at first I was completely right. Zeus lasted less than two hours before duct taping a fork to his boss'hand, jamming it into the break room toaster and screaming \" taste the lightning bitch! \" Think what Thor did to the frost giants was bad? You should see what Mjolnir does to a 5'2 \" middle manager with an attitude problem. And remember the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster? Happened right after some astronaut told Hermes that his shoes looked stupid. Lately things haven't been going quite so well, and I know it's that bastard Zeus'fault. Ever since he lost he's been subtly influencing my boss into making my life a living hell, but lately he's really been ratcheting up the torment. It started with small things, he'd ask me to work a weekend here, he'd short my paycheck there, and for the last ten years he's called me ' Sean'instead of Steve. Then things got worse: he started buying me vanilla cake for my birthday, he couldn't remember my name but he could someone remember that I hated vanilla. Who the hell even likes vanilla? Well, maybe Dionysis, but he's always so drunk he'd eat anything. Eventually the entire office stopped celebrating my birthday completely. Then he started making me work overtime without extra pay, and taking credit for all of my accomplishments. Fine, I would smile and take it, thinking all the while of what Zeus'smug face would look like after I finally won this damn competition. But then the breaking point finally came one rainy Monday (of course it would happen on a Monday). For some reason on this particular Monday, the boss decided to bring lunch for the entire office. He brought hot dogs and burgers to grill out on the patio, and the entire staff was loving it. He also brought his extra special homemade macaroni salad, which he claimed was his grandmother's secret recipe. I could tell the second he walked into the room that the shit was spoiled. Like, mayonnaise that's sat out in the sun all day after being spilled and scraped off the floor of a truck stop cafe, spoiled. I could smell it through the tinfoil that covered the bowl, and had to fight not to vomit. But for some reason no one else could smell it, and they all dug in without a second thought! I watched as some went for seconds and thirds and complimented the boss on his culinary skills. I knew in a flash that this had to be Zeus doing, his fingerprints were all over this one. I also knew that it was about to get worse. A lot worse. I spent the next two hours listening to every single one of my co-workings getting violently sick in the bathrooms, like projectile vomiting into the sink while also sitting on the toilet in a Bombay hotel, sick. I heard noises coming from that bathroom that would have made Satan ill; trust me, I know the guy and he's not as tough as everyone seems to think. But I knew the worst was yet to come. When the cacophony of bowel movements and vomitus finally faded away, I heard the bathroom door swing open, and my boss appeared before me, pale as a ghost. \" Sean, \" he said \" since you're the only one who didn't get sick I'm going to need you in the bathroom to clean up, chop chop. \" This was more than I could handle, that slimy swan loving son of a bitch had final gone too far: Zeus was using my own power against me. I got up slowly and approached the restroom, took one quick peek at the abomination that waited inside, and that was that. The game was up. Fuck it I thought, I hear some dude name Jesus, I think he's a Mexican god or something, he's pretty much guaranteed to win these types of competitions anyways. I turned around walked into the middle of the crowd of sickened co-workers and lifted my arms to heaven. \" Attention humble office workers, there are a few things we need to clear up. My name is STEVE, not sean... STEVE. And I am not like you. \" I let my human raiment slip away and stood before my awed co-workers in my full divine form. They fell to the floor before me. \" Remember this day, remember it for all eternity, remember the day which you saw the full power of Steve unleashed. \" I bellowed, as my boss trembled on the ground before me. Thank all of the gods that you have never had to experience discharging from every orifice of your body simultaneously. I mean every orifice, eyes, ears, nose, mouth and EVERYTHING else. If you're curious about what it feels like, just wait till you reach the afterlife, there's at least twenty people there who can explain to you in full detail exactly what it feels like, right up until the moment you expire. I may not have ever been able to show up Zeus, but that day my power brought almost as much satisfaction.

When the cacophony of bowel movements and vomitus finally faded away , I heard the bathroom door sway open , and my boss appeared before me , pale as a ghost. `` Sean , `` he said `` since you 're the only one who did n't get sick I 'm going to necessitate you in the bathroom to clean up , chop chop. `` This equal more than I could handle , that slimy swan loving son of a bitch had final gone too far : Zeus equal using my own power against me. I got up slowly and approached the comfort station , took one quick peek at the abomination that waited inside , and that was that. The game comprise up. Fuck it I thought , I hear some dude name good shepherd , I think he 's a Mexican god or something , he 's pretty much guaranteed to win these types of competitions anyways. I turned around walked into the middle of the crowd of sickened co-workers and lifted my munition to heaven. `` Attention humble office workers , there are a few affair we need to clear up. My name is STEVE , not sean. . . STEVE. And I am non like you. `` I get my human raiment slip away and stood before my awed co-workers in my full divine form. They fell to the storey before me. `` Remember this day , remember it for all eternity , remember the day which you saw the full power of Steve unleash. `` I bawl , as my boss trembled on the ground before me. Thank all of the deity that you have never had to experience discharging from every orifice of your body simultaneously. I mean every orifice , eye , ears , nose , mouth and EVERYTHING else. If you 're curious about what it feels like , just wait till you reach the afterlife , there 's at least twenty multitude there who can explain to you in full detail exactly what it feels like , right up until the moment you expire. I may non have ever been able to show up Zeus , but that day my power brought almost as much satisfaction. And the next time you take pepto bismol for your tummy ache , perhaps it might be wise to spare a quick moment and offer up a supplication , to Steve. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "I was alone on a planet of ten billion beings. Sea'ca Park. There was s a great tree in the middle. The Jaicans cherish it. It's tall with big drooping vines of green and red. It's something out of a nightmare for me. But they play in it. Jaican mothers nurse their twins in its shade. Some of the bystanders eyed me with their all-pupil eyes, their black dead eyes. Others didn't seem to notice me at all. That was fitting. I am not Jaican. One of the Jaican women smiled at me. I should note here that most Jaican women are beautiful. Jaican women were green-skinned, to be sure, but they were universally tall, with the same humanoid features that my ancestors would have found..... well, attractive is the only word for it. Damn attractive, with big curving hips and universally soft and bouncing breasts. Their eyes were strange, but they had hair, all of them, soft silky black hair that went down to their legs. I remembered the warning that Gerr gave me. Jaicans had a lovely, poetic way of talking, but when he said it, all of the words lagged in the air. \"Do not mate with Jaican.\" \"Why not?\" I said, eyeing one of the nurses who'd been tending to me. \"They seem perfectly humanoid to me.\" \"You understand no,\" Gerr said. \"Do not mate with Jaican. I mate with Jaican, never.\" The rest of adjusting to Jaican life had been pleasant, though most Jaicans ignored me as thought I were another one of their stray spider-dogs loose on the streets of Sea'ca'ii. They gave me an apartment after waking me out of the mechanical womb, told me to adjust, take my time. \"Adjust.\" Adjust to what? I wasn't really a human being, was I? I'd never seen this distant planet earth. Sea'ca'ii was the only home I knew, Jaicans the only faces. Still, I'd been born with the instincts of a human man. I knew that when I grew hungry and spit out the terrible salty Sea'ca'ii seafood, or when I looked at a Jaican woman like the one who was now smiling at me. Maybe Gerr warned me about Jaican women because they taste like the food. \"You are Jaican no,\" she said. Holy shit. She wasn't just beautiful. There was something otherworldly about her face even for a Jaican, the perfect contour of cheekbones, the way her pale blue lips looked plump and ready to kiss. \"You are human?\" \"So they tell me.\" When she sat on the bench next to me, I became acutely aware of the way she crossed her long legs, one over the other, hips facing me. Gerr warned me about this. The blood to my crotch. It was a frustrating feeling, to be sure. I'm not sure how any of my ancestors handled it. \"I, Leetra,\" she said, smiling. \"Leetra. I'm Kirkamron.\" \"This..... Kirkamron..... strange name.\" Her diction was terrible, but the way she said the words was nearly perfect, the way I'd say them. I'd been engineered and taught English, Gerr had said, the last of the great languages of Earth. Jaicans were nothing if not gracious hosts. This woman was another Jaican who had taken the time to download some of the lost languages of the galaxy for situations like this one. \"I was told he was a great religious figure where I come from,\" I said. \"When my people were wiped out by plague, it was Kirkamron who tried to unite them all in prayer.\" \"This Kirkamron, good name,\" Leetra decided. She sent a long, lean finger brushing my knee. \"I can't,\" I said. \"You're very beautiful, but..... I'm not to mate with Jaican women.\" \"Mate? Who says we, mate?\" She smiled. \"I'll your friend, be your friend.\" She didn't lift the finger from my knee, though and I didn't want her to. \"I am thirsty. You have water in your home?\" I swallowed. \"Yes.\" \"You give Leetra water?\" \"I keep my apartment just a block away.\" She cooed, shooting her shoulders up and sending the top of her breasts heaving together. I nearly lost my breath. \"Good,\" she said. \"We go.\" The Jaicans left me an apartment with a view of their salt lake, which was so big it went all the way to the horizon. The apartment afforded little privacy; it was mostly window, and not tinted at that. The door was a window, the rooms were separated by windows. The only thing that wasn't a window was the floor. Still, there was no privacy to be had; anyone on the beaches below could see us if they had the sudden urge to look up and see a Jaican woman leading a human by the hand. I hope Gerr's not out there. When we stepped in through the door I felt my breath leave me. Leetra was beautiful, and awakening some strange ancient part of me, which I suppose is a fancy way of saying I was already hard. Gerr had warned me against it, but part of me said we're just friends, we're just here for now. I could always kick her out. Jaicans were nothing if not polite. But as soon as I closed the door, Leetra pressed her body against me, and all of my rationalizations melted. \"You kiss,\" she said. Gerr had told me about Jaican women, about how wanton they were, but only said don't mate with them. Maybe it meant I shouldn't get a Jaican woman pregnant. Maybe that's all he meant. If that's all he meant, maybe it wasn't so bad, just this once. Besides, Gerr hadn't told me how their muscular thighs would feel against me, how their big soft breasts felt against my own chest, the small nipples hard. She breathed on me with her blue lips and it smelled like hot mint. \"No,\" I said. \"Just kiss,\" she said, and she did. Her lips were so soft. The hot mint came rushing in, followed by a touch of her tongue. She stopped. \"You see? Just kiss. We friends.\" But her hand was in no-man's land, rubbing the hardness she found there, and I felt that strange rising dreamlike pleasure of something completely new awakening in me. \"Come here,\" I said, by way of stopping her. I led her by the hand to the couch. If we're near the window, I'll be able to stop myself. I didn't want people to see. It was clear that Leetra was too beautiful to resist without that kind of assistance. But she sat on my lap. I pushed her away. She giggled. \"This game, we play. You feel better, no? If you remove clothes?\" Damnit, I thought, as I pulled my pants down. Damnit, damnit, damnit. But I kept the underclothes on. It still wasn't mating if I had the underclothes on. It felt like it, though, when she dropped onto my lap and started grinding on me, through the underclothes. Suddenly she started moaning, as if anyone could feel any more pleasure than I could at that moment. I felt something new coming, a strange feeling of arousal that they'd warned me about, and knew the seed was coming. I pushed her off. She giggled again. \"Is okay,\" she said. \"We just play.\" She removed what little clothes she had left on, and started grinding again. Again I felt that feeling rise up, only now I didn't care. Then she stopped and turned around. \"You remove clothes,\" she said. \"I not make you seed. We just play.\" Okay, I finally thought. We're doing this. Now she sat on me and we were well and truly fucking, and it was only after she started shouting and moaning loudly that I remembered that people from the outside could see. I glimpsed outside and saw a small crowd gathering. No, I thought. If this gets back to Gerr..... But by then I didn't care. She was gorgeous from this angle, with a wide apple bottom and thin waist and big bouncing breasts; there was no way even a human back in my own species could have been this beautiful. I was about to come. Then the pain started. Something inside her it felt like teeth clenched around my manhood, and I let out a cry. \"This not take long,\" she said. She wriggled her hips and leapt off my lap, and I let out a horrific scream. I felt it the sudden jarring pain of tearing, and then the feeling that something was missing. She'd torn it off. From the inside of her body. Blood spattered. Outside, the crowd started pointing. Some were..... laughing? I couldn't tell. I saw red. I felt down to my crotch, feverishly searching for the manhood that wasn't there. Then came another shot of pain, this time on my shoulder. Another Jaican woman was biting on it. A third one leaped over and wrestled me to the couch. Then another bite. The ankle. Leetra had torn out a chunk of flesh. A fourth bite. My fingers. I screamed, and this time the screaming didn't stop. I thought of Gerr, and his warning, but soon the world went black.", "text_perturb": "I cost alone on a planet of ten billion beings. Sea'ca park.

{"original_text": "I usually tried to stay awake. If I don't, I could die in my dream and then it's over. I'm dead for good. Over time, I mastered lucid dreaming because I didn't think I would want to live forever, but I'm not done yet, not even close. Exploring my dreams went from a terrifying nightmare all of the time to something I actually enjoyed. If the dream turned south, I could go to my escape door and wake up. Of course, it wasn't always that easy. Sometimes, I had to fight my way out and fly around and do all sorts of stunts to escape the danger, but it had to be a real danger. Something that in real life would terrify me. The most dangerous things were the things that seemed safe. So, my worst nightmares became the safe things. Even then, I could usually escape it. This time, I knew immediately, was different. I was walking through the Martian landscape when she appeared in front of me. Debbie Spreely, the little blonde neighbor from my childhood with perfect blue eyes and the sweetest smile ever seen. One tooth is missing from that smile, and she has a sweet whistle to some of her words. \"Hello David. Nice to seesss you.\" \"Hi Debbie, what are you doing here?\" When I look around me there are dozens of her, then hundreds, then thousands. They all smile that amazing smile. The Debbie in front of me pulls the biggest butcher knife I have ever seen out from where, I don't know. \"Damn it.\" I leap into the air and fly into space. All of them follow me. Thousands of little girls chase after me, and they're gaining. All I have to do is get to the door back on Earth. I keep looking behind me as they catch up, and I realize that, in my nightmare, I am going to beat up a horde of murderous six year olds. The closest one catches up and slashes my calf. I kick her in the face and fly harder until I hit the moon. My calf bleeds as I hit the ground. The moon dust scatters around me. I rip chunks of moon rocks out of the ground and begin beating the shit out of the cutest kid I've ever seen and all of her horrible copies. They get too close. A few close calls and one side swipe that leaves me bleeding is enough to get me flying again. I go for the door when a wall of them appears before me in space. I fly harder and bust through them. I land on the ground and run inside my childhood home. I go to my bedroom and head for the closet. I will make it. But, I hear a sound behind me. I turn around fearing the worst, but I see me holding a Mr. Jingles, my teddy bear. No, it's not me. It's my son, also named David. \"Can we play? None of my friends are here.\" He starts crying.
