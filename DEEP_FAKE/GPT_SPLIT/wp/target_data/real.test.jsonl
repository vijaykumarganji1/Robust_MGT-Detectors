My blink of an eye quickened. He attend down upon me and simply said `` I enjoy it. `` I had no clock time to ponder this simple , disappointing answer as he forced the blade between my ribs and into what seemed to be my very soul.

{"original_text": "Angelique was having an intense staring competition with the clock above the tv on the opposite end of the room. 10 minutes. Ten minutes to go. At the end of those ten minutes, she would learn what the rest of her life would be like. The seconds seemed to slow and it felt like it took hours for a single moment to pass. Angelique's stomach tightened, and she glanced around the room at the party guests. In just ten minutes, it would be 18 years to the second since she was born. And then she would get to be like the rest of her friends and classmates. The young girl, with mahogany hair and tan skin, was the youngest in her class, and quite possibly in her grade at school. Naturally, everyone else had already received their powers. Some people's powers were limited to small'party tricks', such as changing their appearance, and had no significant effect on their surroundings. Some had abilities that made their life easier, such as hovering a couple inches off the ground, allowing them to easily glide down the street. In more extreme cases, students received potentially dangerous powers that required them to see a psychiatrist at least once a month to make sure they could handle the responsibility, or, if they were lucky, they received potentially life-saving powers and were recruited into the NHA, National Heroes Association. A sort of super-natural police force. So far there had been little more then a handful of those people at Angelique's school that year, although she hoped to possibly be added to that small list. Sensing her distress, her friend, Sam, who was lounging on the couch beside her, waved her hand in front of her face, breaking her out of her trance. \" Yoohoo! \" She chirped, giggling. \" Why don't you take your eyes off the clock for a moment? You're not gon na make time fly any faster that way, ya know. \" \" Y-yeah..... ok, sure, \" Angelique stammered. \" So what kind of cake did you get? \" Sam asked, trying to distract her friend. \" Oh, it's red velvet. Nothing too special. \" \" Sounds absolutely delicious. \" Angelique reflexively glanced back at the clock, which now told her she had 7 minutes left, only have Sam cup her cheek, turning her head and forcing her to look away again. \" Did you watch that anime I told you about? \" \" A bit. I don't think it's really my thing. \" \" Aww, but it's so awesome! \" \" It's kinda creepy, really. Why is there some kind of sexually-charged event every five minutes? \" The meaningless chatter continued between the two of them. Every time their conversation seemed to reach a dead end, Sam frantically grabbed at another random topic, like a random song she heard on the radio that she didn't understand, or a piece of local news that didn't really affect anything. Angelique could tell Sam was trying her best to keep her anxiety low, and she was grateful for her efforts. But every now and then she would manage she catch a glimpse of the clock, and recalculated the time she had left. 5 minutes, then 3, 2, 1..... Angelique watched as the seconds ticked down to the final moment, then closed her eyes. The room got quiet. There was only the sound of wind blowing past and the feeling of intense sunlight on her skin. Sunlight? That wasn't right..... even if she was outside, it was a cloudy day, with no sunlight anywhere near her house. Angelique opened her eyes and found herself in the middle of a foreign landscape. A flat, dry, wasteland. There was nothing around her except for dust and rocks. No plant or animal life to be seen. She looked up into a dark blue sky and shielded her eyes from the bright red sun that beat down on her. Within seconds, her skin began to burn, and she struggled to breathe. It only got worse and worse as her skin began to boil in the hot sun. With the last of her breath, she let out a choked scream, and collapsed to the ground. - No one was ever certain about what happened to Angelique. At the very moment where she should have gained her powers, she seemed to slip into a trance-like state, then her eyes rolled back into her head and she screamed before falling unconscious. On the way to the hospital, she began to spasm uncontrollably. Once they got to the ER, the doctors told her parents that she was in a coma. Sometimes, when a person gains their power, it's simply too much for them to bear. No one ever gets to know what the power is, and their brain activity is undecipherable. If there's a way to deactivate the power, the victim never seems to have a calm enough moment to find out how to. No drugs or medical procedures can bring them out of their shock.

How about separating everyone artificially by age and telling them when they can pee or blow their nose? How about asking someone to be creative and then telling them they have to do it a certain way?\" \"You were supposed to write the biography of your respected family member, not a dramatic retelling of their life that changed an unsolved missing person situation into an abduction by aliens. You were twelve, and grieving, so we let it slide with just counselling.

The Air Force.\" He sighed. \"The Air Force advanced you through their ranks quickly because you were the daughter of one of their darlings, and you demonstrated that you had her intuition and affability. You had a stellar career in store until you exploited every opportunity to sneak into their classified records in order to find evidence of a cover-up.\" \"What you're forgetting is that I did find evidence of a cover-up,\" she argued. \"You found evidence that her plane was found intact and sold to a private buyer in India through the black market. This indicates corruption, but no cover-up, and no aliens, young lady.\" \"Don't dismiss me because of my gender, Dad. I'm not so young and I'm definitely no lady. I also found evidence that they doctored her file after her disappearance to show that she was suffering from post-partum depression.\" \"Maybe it was doctored, or maybe her counselor was just updating the file for completeness.\" \"Five years after her last child was born? Or maybe they didn't want to pay out the insurance by ruling it a suicide.\" \"So now there's more than one conspiracy?\" \"Why can't there be?\" \"Because, Reggie, once you need multiple theories to support your paranoia, it conflicts with Occam's Razor.\" \"Dad, you went along with it because it suits your personal agenda. You didn't want the insurance payout, because it was affirmation that said she was really dead. You loved her and you never wanted that. You wanted to believe that she had post-partum depression, freaked out, shut off communications and flew off to India. You want to think that she never called you because she had a mental breakdown and started a new life.\" \"Whereas you think what, Reggie? Still aliens?\" \"Yes.\" Regina paused for dramatic effect. \"And she's home.\" She threw open the door to the parlor, where Adina sat, flipping through the news on her tablet. \"Did you have fun berating your father, dear?\" she said. \"Very much so.\" \"It's not kind, you know.

You have no idea how much joy it gives me to see Regina, tall and strong and healthy, but I have no other reason to stay. On Asphodel, I matter. I'm the woman who united and saved the planet. I'm a general, something I could never have achieved in the Air Force.\" \"Do you know how you inspired me, Mom?\" Regina said. \"You did everything in your power to ensure that we had a good childhood, even as you pursued your career. You taught us about the strength of being a woman in a world that is stacked against us. I can't believe that now you're just the thrall of a dictator.\" Adina pulled herself to her full height. \"Slow down one minute,\" she snapped. \"I'm not a thrall. Maybe I seemed to be, once, when my very survival depended on him, but things change. I direct my own life now. Would I be here now if he had any control over me?\" \"Tell me that you would rather be there on his ugly rock pelted by ugly rocks whose only aim is to pelt more rocks at other planets to turn them into ugly rocks too!\" Adina's lips turned up at that, and despite the tension in the room, both women laughed. \"Regina,\" she said quietly. \"You speak of strength.

{"original_text": "\"So..... As you all know...\" Mayor Sharda tapped a few papers against the podium. \"We have a slight problem on our hands.\" She was a short and prime woman with nest of blond curly hair on her head. Her makeup was slightly smudged and she had smears of ash on her clothing. The group of individuals she was addressing was a group of middle school children, huddled together in the broken down remains of their auditorium. Most of the school had fallen in disarray since the first attack, but it was one of the few remaining buildings large enough to host many individuals. \"We're going to do a slight recap of events. Some of you are recent additions to our group, as you have had your twelfth birthdays.\" She gave a signal to her assistant, a unicorn named Charlene, and a projection of a tall but cruel looking man appeared behind her. He had a pointy hat and a long beard marred with gray. \"This is High Emperor Wizard Supreme Tim. He emerged from the magical world three years ago and has set about conquering the human race.\" Some of the girls in the audience did a gasp and turned their heads away. Many of the younger ones bit their lips to fight back the tears as the older ones clenched their fists tightly. All of them had lost friends and family to the Malevolent Tim. At first, the media claimed it was a terrorist group out of Germany. That they spread false propaganda of magic to their cult follows. Then it became an argument that they had advanced technology. By the time the world caught on to their true nature, it was far to late to strike up any sort of efficient counter attack. \"The past few years have been harsh, but we believe that our small town of Elizabeth has the answer.\" The image changed behind Mayor Sharda again, this time revealing an old text writen in archaic script. \"When our town was founded, a famous medicine woman declared that a special chosen child will arise from this place any time a great evil threatened the world. Now, more than ever before, is the point where we need to rely on that prophecy. It is quite possible that someone located here will gain the ability to defeat Tim.\" She stared out at the room and let that sink in. The older children were still averting their gaze while some of the younger ones started to look hopeful, mystified by what the mayor was saying. \"Unfontunetely, we do not know exactly how they are chosen. We have sought out different ways, and every time that particular person has unfortunately failed.\" The last child was a boy named William. They threw some old bones in the air and they pointed to him when they fell. He sought to learn magic himself and mastered some limited spells, but was quickly killed off by one of Tim's poltergeist inhabited tanks. Shield spells don't work well against tank shells. Before that was a girl named Adelaide who was chosen due to being born under an astrological event. She was the Chosen One for less than a week when Tim sent a thirty foot tall assassin bug after her. They said it was a slow death. That her screams were heard in the middle of town for hours. It was supposed to be a warning for them not to try again. But try again they did. And now it was time to select a new child in an attempt to stop the Malevolent Tim. \"So like we have many, many times before. We are going to attempt to find our Chosen One. Charlene here will whisk you out of town safely and we can all go back into hiding and fearing every day for our lives.\" The unicorn gave the children a nod as the woman covered her eyes with one hand. The other stretched out a finger and started to point randomly in front of her. \"Eenie, meenie, mineie, moe. Catch a tiger by the toe...\" The older of the group started to shuffle about. They placed younger children in front of themselves or hide behind each other. Some of the younger ones purposely sought out the finger, still thinking that magic was a game. \"If he follows, let him go.\" There were a few who just gave up completely and laid against the floor. \"Eenie, meenie, mineie...\" Mayor Sharda paused. Her finger pointed at a girl who froze in place. There were beads of sweat forming on her forehead as the mayor's posture stiffened. Suddenly her arm flitted over to the right, before anyone could think to dodge it. Her eyes snapped open and she stared hard at the one who she found. As though she were trying to burn the image of them into her memories. It was a tall boy, around fourteen. Tomorrow, he would turn fifteen and would be no longer eligible for selection. Today, he was still very much fourteen and very much chosen to be a hero. \"Moe!\" The mayor cried out, wagging a finger at him. \"It's you! You are the Chosen One!\" The boy rubbed the back of his head and looked around. Everyone else was staring directly at him but he was doing his best to be unimpressed. \"I think she was talking to you.\" He nudged the much shorter boy in front of him with his elbow. \"Better go on stage and work that out.\" \"No! Not him, you! You Roger Perkins! You!\" Mayor Sharda knew the name of every person here. \"No you get on that unicorn right this instant and go work on your destiny!\" \"Ah, well...\" He stepped back and gave a shrug as the unicorn approached. \"You see, that would be kind of difficult. I'm not a virgin, after all. Can't really go riding on...\" Charlene nudged him in the shoulder as he attempted to side step away from her. \" ..... Fine.\" He tossed his arms in the air. \"Just fine! FINE! I'll go fix things!\" \"Now remember, you have until you turn fifteen to stop Wizard Supreme Tim. After that, you would have failed your mission and humanity will be doomed.\" Mayor Sharda frowned and narrowed her eyes. \"I turn fifteen tomorrow.\" He looked over at the clock on the wall, which he quickly realized was broken. \"That means I only have a few hours to do it?!\" \"Thirteen hours and fourty-seven minutes, precisely.\" The mayor nodded. \"It's your fault for not coming forth as the Chosen One sooner.\" She folded her arms and nodded slowly. \"It should be fine, Wizard Supreme Tim has many spies within Elizabeth. He always comes personally to finish off whatever child we pick near Choosing Day. I'm sure that you'll have till well before midnight to figure out how you are going to beat him!\" Roger was going to issue another word of protest but music had already started to play. A farewell tune to all who have become Chosen. \" ..... Fine!\" He patted the unicorns neck and she stooped down so he could prop himself up on her back. \"I'm going to go out there. I'm going to save humanity and dammit I am going to find a girl while I do it. Just to prove you all wrong!\" Charlene reared back and Roger got a look of panic on his face as he struggled to not get tossed off. \"Good luck!\" The children cried out to him as he headed out of the auditorium with a scowl on his face.

{"original_text": "Jim had drawn the short straw for night shift in the engine room. He would have volunteered if he hadn't. Night shift was nice, the lights were dimmed aboard the ship in the off hours, stem to stern. Captain's orders, it allowed better regulation of circadian rhythms for the rest of the crew and let Jim avoid the dazzling brilliance that passed for \"day\" aboard the cruiser. He supposed it was his fault, born and raised on Sian where the noon time sun was little brighter than a full moon on Earth. The engine hummed softly as Jim performed routine maintenance. The other man on duty was Stuart, about as salty a sailor as Jim had ever seen, with hair that grew only in patches and a scar that ran from jaw to eyebrow beneath an eye patch. Jim was more than a little afraid of Stu. \"Fluid'll need changing\" Jim nearly leaped from his skin. Drawing a shaking breath he responded \"maintenance logs shows it was changed eight hours ago.\" \"Maintenance logs is wrong, then. Changed up the fluid but didn't clean the filter. Always clean the filter. Drain, clean the filter, fill. Not so hard is it?\" \"Er, no...\" Jim checked the dip stick and noted the reactor cyclant was a touch discolored. \"Well tell that to the day shift crew! Filter needs cleaning every time the fluid's changed. You're not like Alston, I can tell. Pompos ass, thinks'cuz he studied engineering he knows how to be an engineer. Well I say if you want clean cyclant you need a clean filter. I know this engine inside and out I do. Come here, I'll show you how to clean the filter. Always use a number two brush, number three's too stiff and if you use a number one you'll be here all shift...\" Jim learned a lot as they worked, and duties finished almost two hours before the end of their shift. Stu sat down on one of the benches and drew out a flask. \"You're a hard worker, Jim, and you listen what I tell you. So now let's talk about the airlocks.\" \"Airlocks?\" Jim asked, taking the proffered flask. It held rum, strong enough to make his eyes water and sweet as candy. \"Aye, the airlocks. You'll use'em now and again, replace ablation plate, drive needs work on the outside, you'll make your way outside from time to time. But it's the airlocks you need to look out for.\" \"What do you mean?\" He took another swig and passed the flask back. \"You're not the first lad in space, Jim, and you certainly won't be the last. There have been others out there, you know, and not all of'em make it back planetside.\" \"You mean to watch out for mechanical failure?\" \"Aye. And turn the lights off when you get back in.\" \"Lights? Why?\" \"There's a story, and old one. I heard it on a night like this when I was your age. You heard of the Machanna?\" \"Sure, heard about it in school, lost to the stars out around Tau 3, it's held up as a prime example of design failure.\" \"Oh aye, coolant had to be jettisoned from outside, had to be done once a week or the reactor'd overheat. Did they tell you in academy why they couldn't? No, I suppose not. That's not a popular story, not sanctioned and all that. Well they gave the job to a new kid, a sort of hazing. Coolant was a gel back then, was real funny to tell the new kid he needed to clean his suit before they could let him back in. Well, they gave the kid the job, and of course he gets the coolant all over himself, no way not to. They tell him he's got ta clean his suit before they let him back in, so he starts to panic, yeah, because he's already low on air. He flails around a bit, loses most of his tools, everything but his number six scraper. The folks inside see him and tell him to stop, but he's not listenin' see, because he things he's got to clean his suit. So he starts at it with the scraper, and you can't clean a suit with a scraper, it just can't be done, and sure as shit the suit gets a puncture. \"Now the boy was in a fuss before, but now he's in a panic. They're shouting over the radio to get inside the airlock, it's good enough, it was just a joke. Finally the kid gets the message, and pulls himself in. He's bleedin air fast and they dump emergency tanks to equalize the pressure inside the airlock. Kid thinks he's safe and pulls off his helmet. He's half blind, sweat in his eyes, out of breath, so he reaches up to open the door, but the airlock's faulty, the outer door blows off, vents the atmosphere in the airlock and takes the kid with it.\" \"Holy shit.\" \"So the crew's watchin him out there. They don't tell you in academy, but vacuum doesn't kill you like they used to think it did. It's a hard death out there, your skin swells up, your eyes get so dry they'll crack, and there's no relief until you suffocate. And suffocate they did, it was a full ten minutes before the boy quit movin. But now they've got a problem,'cuz the kid's still got his tether on. So the crew draws straws to see who'll cut the tether to let him drift free, and it's the first mate that draws the short straw. \"So he suits up, and while he's doing it they lose sight of the body. So the mate, see, he goes to the other airlock, and he's just about to cycle into it when he looks through the window, and standing there's the kid. So of course there's a panic, and they vent the airlock, send the body back out into space, they fire up the engines and gun it for home, but the tether snaps and the body floats free.\" \"But the Machanna never made it home, reactor overheated. No survivors.\" \"Aye, there was three airlocks on the Machanna, all logged by the computer. They analyzed the black box on it, and do you know what they found? That last airlock? Cycled, from the outside. The kid's still out there, Jim, in a panic, trying to get back inside the ship.

{"original_text": "\"Under the aegis of our gods we took to the stars. Under the guidance of the Pearl of Dawn we ranged out and met other species. With the kindness of the Keeper of Hearths we brought them to our fold. Behind the protection of the Sorrowful Matron we defeated their attacks. Under the gaze of the Shrouded Captain we accepted their gods alongside ours. And now, following the light of the Soothing Torch, we will bring glory to our empire.\" It was a common prayer, and Alit spent a few moments meditating on its meaning before getting to his feet and walking out of the Chapel. It was about giving praise to the gods, of course, but not only. It was about trust. The gods had always stood by the Hiloi, from the founding of the First Empire, through the First and Second Interregnums and the Second Empire of today. The prayer was about reaffirming the Hiloi's commitment to the covenant between them and their gods, and most importantly trust that as long as that covenant held, nothing could shake the Empire. Alit made his way to the Emperor Hijraska's bridge, pausing only briefly when he came across the ship's Chaplain to kiss his ceremonial ring. He'd barely taken his station as the bridge's nav officer that Crusader Settn, the Hijraska's XO, appeared, prompting the officers on the bridge to murmur a Psalm of Benediction as naval tradition mandated. Settn's face was grim and his second pair of ears flat against the top of his head - a sure sign of the worry that ate him inside. He gestured to Alit first, then to Densk and L'citar, the ship's com and tactical officer respectively. \"Officers, please, come with us. The Captain has requested all Bishop officers to join him for a briefing immediately.\" That was out of the ordinary, so Alit jumped on his feet and almost rushed towards the briefing room. Densk was right behind him, but L'citar was a Byrhilf - a proud client race of the Hiloi - and noticeably slower, so he took more time to join them. Luckily, he was the only non-Hiloi officer on the ship, so everyone else was present and accounted for by the time he arrived, and the Captain started. Captain Iltess was a man of few words, as befitted one born under the sign of the Sorrowful Matron. The Goddess of Victory gave her favorites a keen tactical mind, bravery and leadership, but no interest in making long-winded speeches. That belonged more to the Shrouded Captain's priestts and the Soothing Torch's politicians. Hence, it was no surprise to Alit that the Captain immediately laid out the problem. \"We have received a transmission from Planet DX-2552 Threshold of Redemption, local name Earth. It's not unusual for us, we've received low-intensity waves, echoes of local communications, during our surveys of the sector before. In fact, they even sent out deliberate attempts to contact other races before. But this time it's different.\" Densk shook his whiskers in an interrogative gesture. \"Threshold of Redemption? Isn't that the quarantined Class 3 planet with a sub-FTL civilization? The Heymans?\" \"Humans, actually,\" answered Captain Iltess. \"And they're not sub-FTL. Not anymore. Look:\" As he said these words, the Captain activated the briefing display. A human face sprang up between them all - Alit noted, with mild amusement, that Humans looked almost exactly like two-eyed Ine'l. The small patch of hair on the top of its head was the color of the morning sun, and the rest of its face was pale and hairless, with very pale blue eyes and round pupils. When it started speaking, its high-pitched voice was overlaid with a synthetised translation in Hiloira. \" This is Captain Lyudmila Dimitryevna Karpov, of the UNS Lighthouse. We're broadcasting this on all frequencies to let anyone in the vicinity know that we've just completed our very first hyperjump, or FTL jump, or whatever it is you people call it. There are more of my people preparing more ships, and we're going to meet very soon. I hope this message serves as a sample to work on interpreting our language, that'll be useful for our first meeting. I don't know what kind of galactic community there is out there, but we're excited to meet you all! \" The natural voice under the synthetizer seemed sincere, almost eager. Alit couldn't understand the Captain and XO's reluctance. \"This is good news,\" he ventured. \"Now we can start negotiating with them to integrate them into the Empire, and bring their gods into our fol Before he could finish, Crusader Settn flattened his ears and almost bared his fangs at him, a reprimand so strong that it would usually be reserved for criminal misbehavior or negligence. Stunned, Alit was left wondering what had prompted that outburst. The Captain raised a calming hand and went on. \"While it would generally be a good thing, the Emperor and the Cardinals have determined that Earth is to remain quarantined indefinitely. You see, the Humans have exhibited throughout history a peculiar taste for making war.\" \"That's not exactly unusual, sir...\" Densk dared. And it wasn't. A lot of civilizations encountered by the Hiloi had martial cultures. The Byrhilf had lived in warring clans, the system-spanning Dieppal had established clashing planetary kingdoms, and the avian K'K'kt'K has settled all their bloodline disputes in all-out aerial combat between the males of each involved family. The Hiloi themselves did not relish war, but they knew of it. \"I mean, Captain, our own Sorrowful Matron taught us the ways of war...\" \"Perhaps, but the Sorrowful Matron teaches to strike quickly, cleanly and with resolve at the most valuable objectives. She never taught us savagery and destruction. Take a look at what information we have of their gods - artwork, video and other recovered media...\" More images sprang up from the display. A painting of a city, destroyed by a rain of fire as hapless survivors cowered before the divine. A man, naked but for a loincloth, twisting with pain on a wooden cross as blood dripped down to be collected in a cup, his face raised to the sky in silent prayer. A many-armed being, blue-skinned and dancing on a dead body, holding an assortment of weapons and battle trophies. A priest in a feathered robe plucking out the heart of a bound victim as a sacrifice atop a blood-caked pyramid. Another questioning a screaming, broken victim of torture before leading him to a woodpile and setting it alight. And yet another ululating religious cries in apparent ecstasy as he sliced through the throat of a helpless captive in a desert. The images went on and on until Alit felt sick to his stomach..... And he barely noticed when the Captain started speaking again. \"They worship gods of savagery and bloodthirst, who teach pain and destruction to those who would serve them. Send a message to the Fleet, the Cardinals and the Emperor Himself. Quarantine of Threshold of Redemption is broken. Mobilize all ships. Their gods can not be allowed to join ours - they can not be allowed allowed beyond their planet. There is no solution other than total war.\"", "text_perturb": "`` Under the aegis of our gods we took to the lead. Under the counsel of the Pearl of Dawn we ranged out and met other species.

Hence , it was no surprise to Alit that the Captain immediately laid out the job. `` We have received a transmission from major planet DX-2552 Threshold of Redemption , local name Earth. It 's not unusual for us , we 've received low-intensity wave , echoes of local communications , during our surveys of the sector before. In fact , they even sent out deliberate endeavor to contact other races before. But this time it 's different. `` Densk shook his whiskers in an interrogative motion. `` Threshold of Redemption ? Is n't that the quarantined Class 3 planet with a sub-FTL civilization ? The Heymans ? '' `` human race , actually , '' answered Captain Iltess. `` And they 're not sub-FTL. Not any longer. Look : '' As he said these tidings , the Captain activated the briefing display. A human face sprang up between them all - Alit noted , with mild amusement , that human being looked almost exactly like two-eyed Ine ' l. The small patch of hair on the top of its head was the color of the morning sun , and the rest of its face was pale and hairless , with very pale blue eyes and round student. When it started speaking , its high-pitched voice cost overlaid with a synthetised translation in Hiloira. `` This constitute Captain Lyudmila Dimitryevna Karpov , of the UNS Lighthouse. We 're broadcasting this on all frequencies to let anyone in the vicinity know that we 've scarcely completed our very first hyperjump , or FTL jump , or whatever it is you people call it. There are more of my people preparing more ships , and we 're going to foregather very soon. I hope this message serves as a sample to work on read our language , that 'll be useful for our first meeting. I do n't know what form of galactic community there is out there , but we 're excited to meet you all ! `` The natural voice under the synthetizer seemed sincere , almost eager. Alit could n't understand the Captain and XO 's hesitation. `` This is good newsworthiness , '' he ventured. `` Now we can start negotiating with them to integrate them into the Empire , and bring their gods into our fol Before he could finish , Crusader Settn flatten out his ears and almost bared his fangs at him , a reprimand so strong that it would usually be reserved for criminal misbehavior or negligence. Stunned , Alit was left wondering what stimulate prompted that outburst. The Captain get up a calming hand and went on. `` While it would generally be a good thing , the Emperor and the Cardinals have check that Earth is to remain quarantined indefinitely. You see , the Humans have exhibited throughout history a peculiar penchant for making war. `` `` That 's not exactly unusual , sir. . . `` Densk presume. And it was n't. A lot of civilisation encountered by the Hiloi had martial cultures. The Byrhilf had lived in warring clans , the system-spanning Dieppal had make clashing planetary kingdoms , and the avian K ' K'kt ' K has settled all their bloodline disputes in all-out aerial combat between the males of each involved family. The Hiloi themselves did not relish war , but they make out of it. `` I mean , chieftain , our own Sorrowful Matron taught us the ways of war. . . `` `` Perhaps , but the Sorrowful Matron teaches to strike quickly , cleanly and with resolve at the most worthful objectives. She neer taught us savagery and destruction. Take a look at what information we have got of their gods - artwork , video and other recovered media. . . `` More images sprang up from the show. A painting of a city , destroyed by a rain of fire as hapless survivors fawn before the divine. A man , naked but for a loincloth , twisting with pain on a wooden cross as blood dripped down to be collected in a cup , his brass raised to the sky in silent prayer. A many-armed being , blue-skinned and dancing on a bushed body , holding an assortment of weapons and battle trophies. A priest in a feathered robe plucking out the heart of a bound dupe as a sacrifice atop a blood-caked pyramid. Another questioning a screaming , broken victim of twisting before leading him to a woodpile and setting it alight. And however another ululating religious cries in apparent ecstasy as he sliced through the throat of a helpless captive in a desert. The images hold up on and on until Alit felt sick to his stomach. . . . . And he barely noticed when the police chief started speaking again. `` They worship gods of savagery and bloodthirst , who teach annoyance and destruction to those who would serve them. Send a substance to the Fleet , the Cardinals and the Emperor Himself. Quarantine of Threshold of buyback is broken. Mobilize all ship. Their gods can not be allowed to join ours - they can not be allowed allowed beyond their satellite. There is no solution other than full war. ``", "label": 1}
{"original_text": "Announcer Jeremy: Tonight, on The Grand Tour: James is attacked by a Compy. I take a casual off-road drive in a Land Rover. And Richard pees himself. Jeremy: Helloooo Hellooooo, thank you thank you, and welcome to the Grand Tour. Coming to you from Isla Meurta. James: I say doesn't that mean the Island of Death? Jeremy: Yes it does James, but don't think too much about it we've been in worse places. James: Like what, exactly? I saw an actual Dinosaur as we came in on the Engine Helicopter. Four feet and a giant gaping mouth. Hammond: Looked rather like Margaret Thatcher Jeremy: Thank you Richard. No that was a herbivore, and we like herbivores, they don't try to eat us. Richard: Wait hold on how do you know it was a herbivore? You are no expert on dinosaurs sir. In fact you are an expert on nothing. Why are we here? Jeremy: Hammond we are here because your lawyer called the Producers and informed them that you now own this park, and the Producers saw an opportunity. Richard: Wait hold on, I own this now? They didn't tell me that. Jeremy: No they were waiting to see if you got eaten first. James: May I just point out that while the dinosaur we saw when we first landed was in fact a Diplodocus and thus a herbivore, there are signs on this map I've just been handed by the Producers which clearly say Tyrannosaurus Rex pens and Velociraptor Field. These are not..... Jeremy: Yes yes, that's all well and good James, but nobody cares about what you're saying because it's boring. We have been given a challenge. We are to, in a word, survive. We will make our way from this welcome center, through the Raptor fields, past the T-Rex pen, and lastly finish the tour at the exit gates here at the ferry dock. And we will be doing so in these: Richard you'll be driving a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee. James you shall be driving a 1988 Toyota Land Cruiser, and I shall be driving a 2001 Land Rover. Mine of course has more power, because I asked for the most powerful one. James: They all look hideous. Jeremy: Blame Hammond for that, he owns this place now this is his paint scheme. Richard: Wait you can't blame me for this I've just found out I own the place. And don't touch that, that looks expensive to fix. Announcer Jeremy: So we set off on our tour of the island. The Producers gave each of us a flare gun and a package of bear spray, along with a map. James wanted to lead the way but I quickly determined that he was going too slowly so I chose an opportune moment to surge ahead. James: Clarkson you pillock, we have no idea what's ahead of us, slow down! Richard: Yes slow down Jeremy, you might crash into my new park and if you do you're paying for the damages. Jeremy: Hammond if I crash into anything it will just be petrol in a few years so look on the bright side, you've got a future in OPEC! Announcer Jeremy: Everything was going smoothly under my direction when suddenly things took a turn for the worse. James:..... of course this entire park appears to be fabricated from plants and animals that evolved millions of years apart, and could never have existed the same time. That plant over to our right for example is from the Triassic era, while that small dinosaur up ahead would appear to have been from the Tithonian age..... Announcer Richard: James was then attacked by a large number of small dinosaurs. The Toyota was up to the task. James: Get away from me you little bast...... Jeremy: Everything ok back there James? I accidentally bumped a gate open a few minutes ago, I trust everything is progressing normally? James: Clarkson you cock, you've let some dinosaurs out into the wild and they've attacked my truck. My tires have been eaten by some sort of acid. Richard: What do you mean you bumped a gate open Jeremy? If you've damaged my park I'm going to have it taken from your pay. Announcer Jeremy: We progressed through the park, James with a new tire and horribly scarred paint job that actually improved the look of his Toyota. As we approached the Raptor portion of the journey Richard began to show signs of sluggishness. Jeremy: Something wrong with your Jeep Richard? You seem to be falling behind. Richard: No, no nothing wrong with the Jeep. I just keep feeling like we are being watched. James: Of course we're being watched there are cameras all over the place. Richard: No, I think there's something out there. Announcer Jeremy: Hammond was right. His natural instincts as a small animal that survived by sensing when hunters were tracking him were showing through. James: Come on Richard. Everything is behind a fence. Unless Jeremy has broken another gate. Jeremy: I merely grazed that one thank you very much. Richard: Grazed it? Going 50 MPH? Jeremy: Oh cheer up Hammond, look at all this magnificent land, all of it yours. Richard: Not after you get through with it, you're destroying it piece by piece. And what was that noise? Announcer James: That noise was in fact, a Raptor jumping onto the roof of Richards Jeep. James: Wow, what an excellent example of a Velociraptor. Flash it with your high beams Richard. Richard: Ahhhhhhhhhhh Jeremy: Hammond control yourself. The Producers wouldn't send us out here in the wild if they thought we could come to harm. Use your bear spray, I'm sure it will work. Richard: Ahhhh, the cap is broken, the cap is broken. Here we go, and ahhhhOhh god I've sprayed myself. I've sprayed myself. And peed myself if I'm honest. James: It's worked, the bear spray is driving the Raptor away! By Jove Hammond! Announcer Jeremy: Having survived the Raptors and the devious Compys, we now made our way into the dragons den of all lions dens. The Tyrannosaurus Rex pen. All of us were more than willing to proceed past this point in the tour but the Producers insisted. Jeremy:..... And so you see the Land Rover is simply superior to anything else on the road. Look at what we've been through so far. My Land Rover has managed to suffer nothing but a few dents in the bumper. Hammond's Jeep is a mess of urine feces and bear spray, which I'm sure will take forever to clean and the roof is barely holding up. James Land Cruiser is of course the indestructible truck but even it could not escape this tour unscathed. Richard: Jeremy you've gone off the road. Jeremy you're on the wrong path. Jeremy: That's ok, my Land Rover can handle anything. I know what I'm doing, I'm going to race you both to the dock. James: You win Jeremy, come back please. You're headed into the T-Rex pen itself. It's marked off limits. Jeremy: No no, I will have none of your nonsense James May. They could not have a fully grown T-Rex on this island, it's too small. It would starve. My Land Rover can out race anything else on this island, including you're two pitiful excuses for 4x4s. Announcer Richard: And with that we shut up and let him go. We could always find a new co-host. Chris Evans isn't doing anything. Jeremy: I may have erred when I said they couldn't have a full grown T-Rex on this island. Because I am stuck right now in a ditch. A ditch that looks remarkably like a footprint. And I don't know if I can get out of it. Time to switch to sport mode. And now press the fiddly little button, and here we go....no no that didn't do it. I'll have to engage the Terrain Management system and switch it to MudRuts. There we go and..... hahah yes we are free! Britain is gloriously victorious once again! Announcer Jeremy: I shouldn't have been so happy. I might have been out of the ditch but my efforts to gain freedom had been noticed. Jeremy: Oh my god what is that? Must go faster. Land Rover don't fail me now! James: Jeremy scientists estimate that T-Rexs can only reach a top speed of 40 kilometers per hour! You can do it Clarkson! Announcer Richard: As we rounded the last bend to the docks we could see Jeremy in his Land Rover being chased by a T-Rex. Richard: It's almost got you Jeremy, turn hard right! James: Yes, lets see what turns better, a Land Rover or a T-Rex. Clarkson: Now is really not the time James! Announcer James: In fact it was. Clarkson's sharp turn was in fact the difference, and as we boarded the ferry, our cars full of mud and our own biowaste, we couldn't help but thank goodness that dinosaurs couldn't fly. Announcer Jeremy: And on that Bombshell, gooodnight! edit: Thank you all for the kind words. I saw the story right in front of me as soon as I saw the topic. Brilliant suggestion. And I changed gasoline to petrol. Because of COURSE it would be petrol. edit 2: Wow, thanks for the gold.

{"original_text": "Crocket Creek Assisted Living was the furthest place from anyone's mind. Further really. No. Further than that. You're close, but even the people who lived there didn't want to think about it. Almost everyone who came through died of shear willpower after a few months of dry living. That's why it was the perfect stage for a display of raw magic. Not the kind they brought in on Saturdays at 3:00. Real magic. Don had been living in the home since he was a ninety-two years old, and the poor guy didn't even know what hit him. We know now that it was a bolt of pure molten fire that blasted through his wall incinerating him in an instant. On the other side of said wall, in the cafeteria, Fredrick Von Doolenhoffer and Don, the other one from down the hall, were moving sluggishly in a wide circle charging various spells. Neither had charged a functional spell, in part because neither could remember a full spell. They'd been hurling \" Fire bah's \" and casting \" -leeping \" spells to no effect. Well, to an undesired effect. All across the Home lights were bursting, the dead were rising, and, strangest of all, people were in generally good moods. A man who had just flatlined cursed as his spirit was sucked back into his body. Then, he saw the woman across the hall who'd just been reverted to her youth. She winked at him. \" My lucky day \" he muttered. In room 403C, Mrs. Fields was scratching her head wondering how her reflection had come to move independently of her, and her reflection was staring in awe at the fact that her reflection had become a ten foot tall lizard. In short, it was shaping up to be a tough day for the orderlies. Back in the cafeteria a sphere of pure energy was surrounding the two men. It was the kind of wavering energy you'd expect from two men near death. \" Couldn't keep your mouth shut could you, Don? \" Fred said. \" Eh? \" Don replied. \" I said. You couldn't keep your little mouth shut could you?! \" Fred strained. \" Come closer, Fred, so I can hear you. \" Don said. \" Ha. Nice try. \" Fred laughed. \" I really can't hear you, Fred. It's loud in here. \" \" How's this for close? \" Fred shouted, trying out a teleportation spell he'd learned as a fledgling wizard. It caused rain to begin pouring into the cafeteria. Outside a ship sailed past, dragging through the dirt as if the earth were hot butter, or tapioca pudding. The two men were soaked through like old paper, but, out of unconscionable stubbornness, neither showed signs of giving in.

You 're close , but even the people who lived there act n't want to think about it. Almost everyone who came through died of shear willpower after a few months of dry sustenance. That 's why it was the perfect stage for a video display of raw magic. not the kind they brought in on Saturdays at 3:00. Real conjuration. Don had been living in the home since he personify a ninety-two years old , and the poor guy did n't even know what hit him. We know now that it was a bolt of pure molten fire that blasted through his wall incinerating him in an heartbeat. On the other side of said wall , in the cafeteria , Fredrick Von Doolenhoffer and Don , the other one from down the hall , were moving sluggishly in a wide circle consign various spells. Neither had charged a working spell , in part because neither could remember a full spell. They 'd exist hurling `` Fire bah 's `` and casting `` -leeping `` spells to no effect. Well , to an unsought effect. All across the Home lights were bursting , the dead were rising , and , strangest of all , people were in generally just moods. A man who had just flatlined cursed as his spirit follow sucked back into his body. Then , he saw the char across the hall who 'd just been reverted to her youth. She winkle at him. `` My lucky day `` he murmur. In room 403C , mrs. Fields was scratching her head wondering how her reflection had come to move independently of her , and her reflection was stare in awe at the fact that her reflection had become a ten foot tall lizard. In short , it was shaping up to constitute a tough day for the orderlies. Back in the cafeteria a sphere of pure department of energy was surrounding the two men. It was the kind of wavering vitality you 'd expect from two men near death. `` Could n't keep your mouth shut could you , Don ? `` Fred order. `` Eh ? `` Don reply. `` I articulate. You could n't keep your trivial mouth shut could you ? ! `` Fred strained. `` seed closer , Fred , so I can hear you. `` Don sound out. `` hour angle. nice try. `` Fred express joy. `` I really ca n't hear you , Fred. It 's loud in hither. `` `` How 's this for close ? `` Fred shout , trying out a teleportation spell he 'd learned as a fledgling wizard. It caused rain to begin pouring into the cafeteria. Outside a ship navigate past , dragging through the dirt as if the earth were hot butter , or tapioca pudding. The two men follow soaked through like old paper , but , out of unconscionable stubbornness , neither showed signs of giving in.

{"original_text": "He sat motionless in the car, eyes fixed on the house opposite. The house was in darkness, no light save for the pale illumination of the moon bathing the street in an eerie whitewash. The large house sat detached from any other on the street, it's large expanse of verdant garden surrounding it like a moat bordered by a low chain link fence. He glanced at the digital segment display clock embedded in the dash, the numbers glowing an ethereal green, momentarily before returning his gaze to the house. Beds of brightly pigmented flowers lined the pathway to the front door and dotted the lawn, a sea of purples, yellows, and reds. A great silver birch tree dominated the scene, rising nearly as tall as the two storey house's slate tiled roof, it's bark gleaming in the moon's glare, matching the house's whitewashed wood panels in luminance. He grabbed the white cigarette box from the passenger seat, opened it, and plucked a cigarette fluidly, placing it between his lips loosely and throwing the box back onto the seat. A click echoed through the silence of the car as he pushed the cigarette lighter into the socket. Moments later it popped back out, the smell of burnt dust accenting the air. He picked it up and brought the glowing orange coil to the end of the cigarette and lit it. Placing the lighter back in the socket he inhaled deeply on the freshly lit cigarette, the tip glowing a deep red as he did so. Nearly time he thought. The exhalation filled the car with smoke, a thick yellowish haze which made him crack a window to ensure a perfect line of sight on the house. Nothing could go wrong tonight, this was his one shot. The cigarette shortened as the man waited until finally he flicked it from the window, the used butt smouldering on the asphalt. Now was the time, he thought to himself as he stared into his reflection in the mirror, an empty gaze meeting his own. The car door swung open and the man purposefully stepped out. He stood for a moment, hand resting on the door frame, whilst he surveiled the area one last time. Still as the grave. He might've chuckled had the task ahead not been facing him. Striding forward he flung the door behind him shut, the dull thud the only sound in the still night air. It was a cool night, not that it mattered, it had to happen regardless of the weather. A ball of mist hung around his mouth as he exhaled, only to be displaced as he strode forwards, crushing the still-warm cigarette butt beneath his heel as he passed. Stepping up onto the kerb his black dress shoes grated lightly on some loose gravel kicked up no doubt by some passing car. The concrete slabs that lead to the door seemed of the purest white under the bright night sky. Each step brought him closer to the house, his own plan ringing in his ears; kill them, no witnesses. He approached the door and extended his hand towards the unembellished know. His hand hovered an inch away as he weighed up his options. Turning on his heel he stepped down from the porch and headed to the back of house. The back garden was much the same as the front, kept neatly and tended to with much love. A wooden shed stood in the back right corner. He eyed it with curiosity before snapping back to the task at hand. A few cinderblock steps led up to the screen door and he took them silently, unlatching the screen door's length of string from it's makeshift hook and loop configuration. He tried the handle but it yielded no results. Not to be deterred he brought a small cloth roll out of his pocket and laid it out on the top step. An assortment of slim hooked, curved, and straight metal lock picks lined the beige linen. He selected two with a deftness only from years of experience, and put the first into the lock. He tested the pins in the lock gingerly before slotting the tension wrench in, pushing the line again, and twisting. The door swung open, he picked up his tools, pocketed them and went in. It took him a moment to adjust to the absolute darkness inside the house, but before long he could identify a kitchen as the room he was in. A pine table adorned with a red and white checkered water resistant tablecloth stood in the centre of the room. He walked by, running the fingertips of his left middle and ring fingers along the cool surface, focused solely on the doorway ahead of him. Inside the house he could see no doors closed, a godsend for finding his target he thought. Stepping through the doorway he followed the corridor into the main hallway of the house, walking parallel with the steps until he reached their foot where he stopped. Listening closely for a minute he could hear nothing. Could it be that they weren't home? No. No, he'd done far too much research for that to be true. Crouching low he began to ascend the staircase, one step at a time, his shoe making little noise on the strip of carpet running down the middle of the stairs. He stopped at the top. This was it. Finally. Now he just had to carry out his plan like in so many dreams before. He new exactly where to find them. Stepping towards the only closed door he began breathing heavily. He twisted the doorknob and swiftly opened the door, still maintaining silence, though now his movements buzzed with a nervous energy. There, in the otherwise empty double bed, the rapist. Two giant strides and the man was upon his prey. Straddling him on the bed his hands clamped down, crushing his target's windpipe. The shock woke the sleeping man and he began to struggle, hands clawing at his assailant's forearms, torso bucking in an attempt to throw his attacker. Neither man was any larger than average, neither particularly muscular yet the assailant could not be moved, his grim determination set in his eyes, dead in the dim light. As the last ounce of oxygen bled from every cell in the man's body a surge of strength coursed through him, a last ditch attempt to stay on this planet. The two went tumbling off the bed and clattered onto the floor, rolling one on top of the other, each trying to maintain dominance. They traded punches in between grapples, neither willing to relent. The attacker, only slightly larger, used his size to his advantage, sitting on the other man's stomach and swinging wildly at his face. Each hit made a sickening thud and a occasionally even a slight cracking sound. After several minutes of constant abuse the victim lay bloodied and in laboured breaths. The attacker stopped to catch his breath, and in doing so was caught off guard. The man threw his assailant off him and into the wall behind him, stumbling to his feet he threw his entire body weight into a shoulder slam pinning the attacker to the wall by his throat. The drywall cracked behind the attacker and the other man fell backwards onto the bed, keeping himself from falling with a single shaking arm. The attacker stayed slumped back against the wall and coughed, a metallic taste tinged his mouth as he spat and saw blood. The rage boiled within him again. He stepped to the battered form in front of him, it's face barely distinguishable in the dark, though the blood stains on the skin stood out clearly. He reached out a hand, grabbing the man by the collar of his pyjama top, and threw him with all his strength into the ground. He stamped on his skull, again and again, he could feel no more movement but he wouldn't stop until he was sure. From the corner of his eye he saw a waist-high wooden cabinet leaning against the wall. Perfect. He dragged it along the wall to be next to the man on the floor, it's weight deceptive for the size. With the faintest trace of a smile he put all his strength into tipping it. The crunch was sickening and the mess on the floor worse, his victim's head now split and flattened. The dark red blood seeped into the pores of the wood between which the head had been sandwiched. Chunks of everything this man had been squelched underfoot as the killer walked towards the door, the puddles of blood splashing onto his ankles as he walked. As he reached the doorway, head spinning with the delirium of finally killing the rapist he'd planned the death of for so long, his stomach turned to ice and his heart froze. A pair of clear blue eyes looked up at him. Illuminated by a ray of moonlight was the tear-streaked face of a young girl, porcelain skin contrasting long brown hair, reaching down to her pink nightie, teddy bear in hand. The rapist had been a father, he had been a person. So dead set on retribution the man had been he hadn't even considered there being a person behind the villainous cretin. Yet here stood the furthest from that possible, here stood innocence and beauty, here stood happiness and life. Here stood a witness. \"Daddy?\" she whimpered. No witnesses, he thought.", "text_perturb": "He sat motionless in the car , eyes fixed on the house opposite word.

The drywall cracked behind the attacker and the other man settle backwards onto the bed , keeping himself from falling with a single shaking arm. The attacker stayed slumped back against the wall and coughed , a metallic taste tinged his mouth as he applaud and saw blood. The craze boiled within him again. He stepped to the battered manikin in front of him , it 's face barely distinguishable in the dark , though the blood stains on the skin stood out clearly. He reached out a handwriting , grabbing the man by the collar of his pyjama top , and threw him with all his strength into the ground. He stamped on his skull , over again and over again , he could feel no more movement but he would n't stop until he was sure. From the corner of his eye he saw a waist-high wooden cabinet angle against the wall. perfective. He dragged it along the paries to be next to the man on the floor , it 's weight deceptive for the size. With the faintest touch of a smile he put all his strength into tipping it. The compaction was sickening and the mess on the floor worse , his victim 's head now split and flattened. The dark red blood seeped into the stoma of the wood between which the head had been sandwiched. Chunks of everything this man had been squelched underfoot as the killer walk towards the door , the puddles of blood splashing onto his ankles as he walk. As he reached the doorway , head spinning with the delirium of finally killing the rapist he 'd planned the death of for so long , his stomach turned to frost and his heart froze. A pair of light blue eyes looked up at him. Illuminated by a ray of moonlight was the tear-streaked face of a young female child , porcelain skin contrasting long brown hair , reaching down to her pink nightie , teddy bear in hand. The raper had been a father , he had been a person. So dead set on retribution the man had make up he had n't even considered there being a person behind the villainous cretin. Yet here stood the furthest from that possible , here stood innocence and beauty , here stood felicity and life. Here remain firm a witness. `` Daddy ? '' she wail. No looker , he thought.

He would have walked past the small brown log cabin tucked into a thick growth of trees if he hadn't heard a low buzzing sound. The old wooden door was slightly ajar, Emerson drew his pistol and pushed inside. The cabin smelled like wet rot and butchered meat. Bile rose in his throat, not because of the smell, but because he knew what it belonged to. Floor boards creaked underneath his feet as he walked toward a closed door on the back wall. With each step the buzzing grew louder. He pressed his shoulder against the door and took a deep breath. Gently he pushed the door open holding his pistol at the ready. A young woman sat in a folding metal chair, tattoo gun held in her hand. \"Miss, I'm Special Agent Emerson. I'm here to help you,\" Emerson said calmly lowering his pistol. She lifted her head, her wide blue eyes met Emerson's, they were a mixture of fear, confusion, and anger. \"Why do I need help?\" she asked genuinely perplexed. Emerson took a cautious step forward and held his hand out for her to take. \"Just come with me please, it's not safe here.\" She nodded, dirty strands of blonde hair fell into her face. \"Where did this come from?\" she asked Emerson turning her arm so he could see it.

His last confirmed save was before I was even born. I don't know why the Hero's Guild even lets him retain membership, let alone take on sidekicks. I flip through the stack of papers from his file, searching for, I don't know, something. I don't even care if he notices me. We're supposed to meet in two hours, when I'll be officially on duty with him, but I've been watching him all day, hoping that the files were somehow wrong. His strength, speed, durability, all of his stats, average. Mediocre. No rescues in 22 years, no villains or anti-heroes taken down, nothing. When I saw his power was listed as \" Special typing ,\" I had some hope. That was, until he got mugged this morning. Gave the guy his wallet and everything!

You would prefer that, wouldn't you? \" He leaned forward onto the table, hands clasped together in front of him, still smiling just enough to annoy me. \" You've been looking into me, and I've been looking into you.

I'm the best hero the Academy has seen in years. \" You're no doubt the strongest hero the Academy has seen in a decade. \" I hate this guy. He is so slow.

At the tender age of two, I was already scraping craters out of our front lawn - something my father found amusing, despite my mother's furious stares. He was a man of discovery, always tinkering away at something or other in his garage workshop, and I took to his example from the beginning. By age eleven, I had finished the tunnel system underneath our backyard, complete with sleeping quarters and a dining room. My father beamed as I rushed from entrance to exit, showing off my hard work. That night, my mother put her foot down. They shipped me off to Winghamton Prep shortly after that. Mother thought it would knock some sense into me - get me to see that there was more to life than digging holes - but she could not have been more wrong.

Not that the media had cared at all about that tidbit of history. They were much more interested in the particulars of the Ark Project, and in trying to figure out just why it was that the World Government had been so secretive about it. To the media, secrets were meant to be exposed, especially if they were government secrets, and since they were World Government secrets, the media believed that there shouldn't be any secrets they weren't privy to.

The Ark Project, the media managed to uncover, was an idea conceived during a number of meetings of the World Government, in order to discuss, and then come up with a solution, to the world's prison overcrowding situation.

{"original_text": "This is becoming pretty long! - I live in the City of Northern Light. It's about twice the size of Little Cleveland, half the size of Lex, and a small dot compared to New Atlantis. In school they told us it's supposed to be one of the oldest cities in the country. It's the oldest I know of. It has a over a million people, 50 schools and universities combined, 14 Halo department stores, and a lot more. Best of all though, it has an abandoned school from over 100 years ago that me and my buddies sneak into every Saturday. Nobody knows it, but the sewer that runs through the town and under Aurora Park has a connection to it. We sneak in through a manhole in the park and leave whenever we want. The school is called Alexandra's School of Engineering and it used to be some sort of hub of technology before the world around us was built. I can't imagine what things would have been like before Northern Light existed, but I imagine it was not very interesting and maybe it was dark without the city's lights. Usually my buddy Julius and I spent an hour hoverboarding up and down the old engineering hill where all of the graduate students built their models. Its like a monument and it's better than any terrain park I've ever seen outside, back in Northern Light. The school itself was like a giant domed colosseum of buildings. There were a few lights up on top that were still on, giving the place the feel of about 8 PM in Northern Light, the time when they dim the city lights. Somedays our group goes exploring instead. We often don't venture too far into anywhere since there aren't very many functional lights left and it can get a little spooky. On Halloween of this year our friend Casey was turning 15 and he told us he would go deeper into the school than we'd ever been. He wasn't going to be afraid anymore. He had a perfect setup too. There was a cam on his helmet for streaming to us, thanks to the signal boosters he would drop along the way. He had a Neverdie light built for tunneling companies (a light supposedly so efficient that as long as you are moving some every hour, will never die). He would ride his hoverboard along, going through every hallway he could find and if he ever got lost he had his VR goggles set up to guide him back along the trail of virtual breadcrumbs. The whole thing was perfect. We were finally going to get to see the parts of the school we were too afraid to go to before. Well that was the plan anyways. Unfortunately, fearless Mikey K. joined us that day and he rarely let anyone get the better of him. He had already talked about joining Casey, and then Julius went ahead and dared him to ride along. So Mikey went too with no more than the usual gear we carry, which is just a phone (a phone which doesn't even get reception in the depths of the school without signal boosters). Five minutes into their endeavor Casey had already ditched Mikey and was exploring everything we always wanted to see. We mostly forgot about Mikey since we couldn't take our eye off of the stream, but every once in a while one of us got a bad feeling and asked, \" Do you think Mikey's okay? \" Nobody ever responded and we just kept watching. After two hours, Casey was back out in front of the school and we couldn't stop talking about all of the things we'd seen. He'd found tons of old tech for us to play with and even an old mechanical laptop with its ancient charging cable. After the initial excitement died down a bit Casey looked around for Mikey. \" Where's Mikey at, guys? \" he asked. \" I figured he'd run back out right away after I ditched him. \" \" He never came out. \" Julius said. \" I don't think anybody knows what to do. \" \" Shit, guys! \" he yelled. \" Are you kidding? What are you doing, we have to find him! \" \" Yeah, \" I said, \" but we don't have all the gear. You're the only one prepared enough to go. \" \" Are you kidding me? We'll just go in pairs, we aren't leaving Mikey in there. God, sounds like you guys already gave up on him. \" And that was the last of that conversation. We paired up and trekked inside. I went with Julius, Casey went with his little brother, and our other buddies Pete and Suds paired up as well. Unfortunately, there wasn't any good way for us to stay connected. Each group took two of Casey's boosters, but if we really split up it would be hard to get very far and keep connected. After half an hour of searching with Julius he told me he had to take a whiz. We'd been to several rooms Casey hadn't and had a wing left that nobody had been too before. We also didn't end up having any connection to any of the others. The plan was to meet back out front after an hour just in case. The part of the school we were in was the structure that contained the buildings for most of the classes and offices. There were various creepy courtyards full of mostly decayed plants, locker rooms, and gyms with equipment that must have been for keeping fit. Thanks to modern science, most of our gyms are just for practicing sports since working out became an antiquated, obsolete way of staying healthy. All in all, it was quite the interesting place for a bunch of teenage guys to explore. Well, while Julius was taking a piss I went off for a bit just to look around and found an old courtyard similar to the others. I told him I'd be right back, and fully intended to be. I went inside and saw the same dead plants with their withered leaves, untouched by time. After a moment, I saw a hole in the ground by an old dead tree. I leaned in to take a peek with my phone light, intending to digitally map the room and get out.

I expected her to crack a joke, or rebuke me with her motherly charm but instead, she looked up, and stared straight into my eyes. \"I was the one who killed her.\" For a second, I could hear each rain drop hit my window, the neighbors fucking to Marvin Gaye, kids laughing as they past my room, blood boiling.

He had been here a few times before, yet each time he was filled with a sense of dread. What if it didn't work? Well, he actually knew exactly what would happen if it didn't work. He'd wake up again. The real question was what if it did work. \"So let's run it through one more time.\" said Janet. \"We only have 30 minutes until the heart attack.\" One more time. As if that would help. He had run this plan through his head for centuries, and while Janet was aware of the plan and the stakes, she had no way of knowing she had as well. \"It's not that complicated Janet. In a minute I will step into the chamber, and hopefully, turn into a Popsicle.\" And not be groundhog'd any longer, he thought. He could only imagine it, a world past January 22, 2016. Who knows when he would wake up. The further in time the better. He would have more to work with that way. He could only hope that someone found a way to wake him up before his body decomposed to the point that the universe considered him dead. Then he would just wake up yesterday and have to try again. He thought back to a time when that very thing brought him excitement. The possibilities had been endless. At first he only fixed trivial things. A date gone wrong turned into a blossoming relationship. Failed lottery ticket purchases had turned him into a billionaire. Missed opportunities had turned into open doors all around him. The world was his playground. All it took was the pull of a trigger. Then he had realized the full potential of his groundhogging. He could go back till his very birth and relive his life however he wanted. Over and over. He had been the President of the United States, a world famous musician, an evil genius that ruled most of the world, a philanthropist that changed humanity for the better, a hermit who never left the house, a man who just wanted to die. Over and over and over his life played before him. People and places turned to mere tools that he could use and then restore. As long as he stayed within March 4, 1965 and January 22, 2016. It turns out the only thing he couldn't change was his genetics. No matter how healthy he ate or how in shape he was, his heart would give out today, and he would groundhog.

Hopefully it would look like the future. Anytime past tomorrow. Then he would have more than just these past 50 years to utilize. Hell, there may even be someone else like him out there that could help him. \"Alright Jim, everything is dialed in and ready to go. Ready on your word.\" Janet said. Jim nervously walked across the room to the chamber. Please work. Please work. Please work. He kept thinking as he laid his body down into the machine. Once he laid down he heard Janet type into her computer and then the hiss of a motor near his head closed the chamber door. \"Can you hear me?\" Janet said. \"Loud and clear\" He replied over the intercom. \"Alright, we have 10 seconds until freeze.\" She said with a steady voice. \"Thank you for everything Janet. I couldn't have done this without you.\" Jim said. \"That's why you will make sure there is a statue of me in a big city in the future.

{"original_text": "For the longest time the rumours coming out of Siberia had been of the apocalyptic variety. Secret bases doing this, quarantines hiding that, civilians disappearing because they had seen those. Misinformation had been circulating ever since the end if the war. Most of them - because there was one notable exception - were lies. Vadim knew this, but he didn't know which were lies. The higher ups trusted him with enough information to do his job but not enough to ever fully know what he was doing. He liked it this way because it made his job a lot easier. Ostensibly it was in case he ever defected or the bureau was ever infiltrated. They could get some information but not a lot - the foreigners thought of communism as'sharing.' Vadim knew how wrong they were. At least here, in his grey office with his grey computer screen and his regulation black pen. Ten minutes to the hour Vadim took a notebook from his top drawer and flicked to the lost recent page. Every one prior to today's had been seen by his superior at the end of working hours and redacted accordingly. All of the lines had once contained Vadim's precise handwriting - now they just held intriguing black bars. He turned the radio dial to the preset channel. Someone else was in charge of the frequency, he just had thirty six dial positions, and thirty five of then broadcast nothing but static. With five minutes to go Vadim adjusted his headset and waited. The first few hundred times Vadim had felt tension at this point. What would the message be? Who was the person broadcasting everything? What was he a part of anyway? \"Situation normal.\" And then static again. Vadim took his pen and recorded the message for the sixth time today. Six messages and three to go. Tomorrow there would be nine new black bars in his notebook. He clicked the dial to a dead frequency, removed the headset and replaced his notebook. There was paperwork to do. A large filing cabinet took up an entire wall of his office. In it you would find the entire history of post war Siberia in newspaper articles, photographs and departmental memos. It was Vadim's second job. He reached over and took the first newspaper and began to read. It was mostly small town stuff but here and there he found mentions of foreign affairs. How the capitalists weren't doing so good. How Russia would prevail. A KV tank had been found in ruins. Those things were still turning up almost thirty years later. Vadim dove further through the papers, highlighting things and recording his findings in his official ledger. That ledger was the only thing that he truly loved about his job. It was the only thing they didn't censor. When he left this job - died - it would be the only thing besides the black bars that proved he was here. And that was when he saw it. It was nothing - just a small piece about a town in the wilderness. But it was the name that mattered. That was the name. The only one that mattered. With trembling hands Vadim held the paper up to his eyes, reading it again to make completely sure, wanting so badly to be correct. He was. Vadim stood and almost ran - no one was watching but you could never be sure - to drawer thirty seven. Every other drawer was filled with paper and card, but this one slid open as light as a feather. In it there was a tiny note with the name on it and a phone number. He checked it again. Vadim's job was to sit in a room for nine and a half hours a day, taking down radio messages and searching for this town's name. Five minutes. If he ever found anything he was to make no scene, to call no attention to himself, but to file the report at the end of his shift with a blue tag on his notebook. Two minutes. Vadim almost missed it for the first time in years. He jammed the headset on, fumbled for the notebook and dropped his pen. The radio spurted into life as he was reaching for it. \"Situation normal.\" Disappointed that the message was the same, Vadim made his note and recapped the pen. The disappointment was fleeting, soon drowned in the tide of wonder. The article..... He grabbed it and read it again hungrily, committing every strange word to memory. He read and reread until he knew the three paragraphs backwards and forwards. He mouthed along with it. When the reporter wrote it she had no idea that the town she had been visiting - a standard, Siberian wasteland town with thirty people living there - simply did not exist. As Vadim read the piece days later in Moscow he shared her ignorance. To him that name could have been anything until he saw the familiar collection of letters. Before that day he thought it was a person, perhaps a spy, or a politician..... Maybe even a traitor. But no. It was a town. Three minutes. Calmer now, but still feeling the buzz that can only come from breaking routine so dramatically, Vadim turned the dial, out on his headset, opened the notebook and uncapped his pen. One minute. When the burst of static signified the line was open Vadim's mind was still with the residents of a town he knew nothing about. He heard the message but the first word - the word Help - slipped by him. The voice, once emotionless, was a melting pot of pain and fear. A siren could be heard in the background but it was thin and strangled. Days of use had pushed it beyond every limit the factory had intended. \"It..... Is awake.\" The radio clicked off - broken transmission, it had only been programmed for two words - and Vadim sat in stunned silence. He never heard the rest of the message. If he had he would of recorded it in his notebook and the next day it would have been redacted, the blue tag removed, and he would have gone back to work before being redacted himself. The full message would have lived under those black bars in a notebook forgotten to all but Vadim. Help. It..... Is awake. It has us prisoner.", "text_perturb": "For the longest time the rumours coming out of Siberia had been of the apocalyptic mixture. hole and corner bases doing this , quarantines hiding that , civilians disappearing because they had seen those.

In it you would find the entire history of post war Siberia in newspaper articles , picture and departmental memos. It was Vadim 's second caper. He reached over and took the first newspaper publisher and began to read. It was mostly lowly town stuff but here and there he found mentions of foreign affairs. How the capitalists follow n't doing so good. How Russia would obtain. A KV armoured combat vehicle had been found in ruins. Those things were still deform up almost thirty years later. Vadim dove further through the papers , highlighting things and read his findings in his official ledger. That ledger was the only thing that he really loved about his job. It was the only thing they did n't ban. When he left this book of job - died - it would be the only thing besides the black bars that proved he was here. And that was when he pick up it. It was nothing - just a small piece about a townsfolk in the wilderness. But it represent the name that mattered. That was the gens. The only one that weigh. With trembling hands Vadim held the paper up to his eyes , reading it again to make completely certain , wanting so badly to be correct. He be. Vadim stood and almost ran - no one was watching but you could never constitute sure - to drawer thirty seven. Every other drawer was filled with paper and placard , but this one slid open as light as a feather. In it there was a tiny note with the public figure on it and a phone number. He checked it over again. Vadim 's chore was to sit in a room for nine and a half hours a day , taking down radio messages and searching for this town 's name. Five mo. If he eer found anything he was to make no scene , to call no attention to himself , but to file the report at the end of his shift with a blue tag on his notebook. Two bit. Vadim almost missed it for the inaugural time in years. He jammed the headset on , bungle for the notebook and dropped his pen. The radio spurted into life as he was get through for it. `` place normal. `` Disappointed that the message was the same , Vadim shit his note and recapped the pen. The disappointment was fleet , soon drowned in the tide of wonder. The clause. . . . . He grabbed it and read it again hungrily , committing every strange word to memory board. He read and reread until he knew the three paragraphs backwards and forward. He mouthed on with it. When the reporter wrote it she had no idea that the township she had been visiting - a standard , Siberian wasteland township with thirty people living there - simply did not exist. As Vadim read the piece solar day later in Moscow he shared her ignorance. To him that name could have be anything until he saw the familiar collection of letters. Before that day he thought it was a soul , perhaps a spy , or a politician. . . . . maybe even a traitor. But no. It exist a town. Three minute of arc. Calmer now , but still feeling the buzz that can only come from breaking routine so dramatically , Vadim wrench the dial , out on his headset , opened the notebook and uncapped his pen. One bit. When the burst of inactive signified the line was open Vadim 's mind was still with the residents of a town he knew nothing about. He heard the substance but the first word - the word Help - slipped by him. The phonation , once emotionless , was a melting pot of pain and fear. A femme fatale could be heard in the background but it was thin and strangled. Days of use of goods and services had pushed it beyond every limit the factory had intended. `` It. . . . . represent awake. `` The radio penetrate off - broken transmission , it had only been programmed for two words - and Vadim sat in stunned silence. He neer heard the rest of the message. If he had he would of recorded it in his notebook and the next day it would have been redacted , the blue tag end removed , and he would have gone back to work before being redacted himself. The entire message would have lived under those black bars in a notebook forgotten to all but Vadim. help. It. . . . . make up awake. It has us captive. ", "label": 1}

We know from cave drawings that the initial years of Cro-Magnon in central Europe were intensely violent.

Their only weapon against dragons was the longspear, which was, of course, only effective at short range. And, once at short range, there was very little hope of survival. The advent of the throwing spear, followed by the bow and arrow, marked a turning point in the war between Man and Draconis. Suddenly, man was able to project weapons beyond his own vulnerable body, driving the dragons back into the hills and wresting control of the forest from its ancient lords.

{"original_text": "How many things last four hours? Cooking Christmas dinner? The Extended Edition of Return of the King? A drive from London to Manchester? Had there ever before been a war that lasted four hours? James didn't think so. He'd heard about the war that lasted fifty-two minutes between Britain and Zanzibar, and he'd heard of the 365 year war between the isles of Scilly and Holland, but he doubted that there had ever been a four hour war before. And it had never destroyed the world before. He brought the binoculars up to his eyepieces. \"Look!\" he pointed across the plain and spoke into the radio. \"Oxford's almost untouched.\" \"They'll all be dead. If the blast didn't get them the fallout will have taken them by now,\" his companion, a stocky northerner didn't bother following where James was pointing. \"But think of all that's there! Libraries full of books! Computers! Engineering!\" James gasped. \"And there's three hospitals. MRI machines, X-ray machines, anti-biotics by the cart full.\" \"It's almost twenty miles away kid,\" the northerner growled. \"We need tinned food, and medicine that isn't irradiated too much.\" The northerner pointed to the stain of houses at the bottom of the hill. \"That village's food and medicine will keep us alive a lot longer than any number of books.\" \"If we're going to rebuild civilisation \"We're not lad.\" The northerner picked up his bag and trudged over the fields towards the village. Around him the grass was dying. It was struggling hard, but large patches were turning brown, and some black. There was not a bird in the sky. Not an insect on the wing. The air was empty. \"Come on,\" the Northerner growled. \"Your radiation suit won't keep the fallout gone forever. The sooner we can fill these bags with food the sooner we can go back underground where its safe.\" \"I still think its a sign,\" James said defiantly. \"We scientists in the particle accelerator building were the only ones who survived. All over the world it will be the same, the scientists in the deep labs will be the ones who survived when all others perished. We can build a perfect utopia.\" \"Kid, there are fifty-eight of us men in the Diamond,\" the northerner just shook his head, making his radiation suit wobble. \"And there are only 13 women. Unless you want to do some real disgusting stuff the next generation is goin to be a lot smaller. And even if we force all the women to have six babies each, do you really think we can teach them all the stuff we know? WHat's going to matter to them isn't books or x-ray machines or the diamond light source particle accelerator.

Now all the trees were dead and barren you could see almost twenty miles in every direction. \"You think there are?\" \"Britain had three hundred warheads,\" the northerner said. \"France had about the same. That's enough to hit every American city with a population greater than 100,000 people twice. But do you really think its enough to wipe out every american? California alone is the size of Britain and France combined lots of space to hide.\" The northerner looked up at the sky. \"And that doesn't include the Russians, or the Chinese. And there's the countries we wouldn't have hit at all, Brazil, Australia, South Africa.

Cooking Christmas dinner ? The Extended Edition of Return of the King ? A drive from London to Manchester ? Had there ever before exist a war that lasted four hours ? James did n't think so. He 'd heard about the war that lasted fifty-two minutes between Britain and Zanzibar , and he 'd heard of the 365 year war between the isles of Scilly and Holland , but he doubted that there had ever been a four hr war before. And it had never put down the world before. He brought the field glasses up to his eyepieces. `` Look !

Around him the grass embody dying. It was struggling hard , but enceinte patches were turning brown , and some black. There was not a bird in the sky. Not an worm on the wing. The air comprise empty. `` hail on , '' the Northerner growled. `` Your radiation suit wo n't keep the fallout blend in forever. The sooner we sack fill these bags with food the sooner we sack go back underground where its safe. `` `` I still think its a sign , '' James enjoin defiantly. `` We scientists in the particle accelerator building follow the only ones who survived. All over the domain it will be the same , the scientists in the deep labs will be the ones who survived when all others perished. We can build a pure utopia. `` `` Kid , there are fifty-eight of us men in the Diamond , '' the northerner just shook his head , make believe his radiation suit wobble. `` And there be only 13 women. Unless you want to do some real disgusting stuff the next coevals is goin to be a lot smaller. And even if we force all the women to have six babies each , do you really think we can teach them all the stuff we know ?

{"original_text": "It was Silvia's and my 2nd anniversary dating together. Despite a really rocky start and some strange moments, things seemed to be going really well. Our interests, temperments, and even our crazy sides matched. We met at an anime convention. She was looking over the latest re-releases of Battle Princess Mintaka. I don't know why, but I felt compelled to strike up a conversation. Well, it was probably the fact she was a fiery red-haired, piercing green eyed, freckled, glasses wearing, anime-interested young woman with a figure that my baser instincts had only theorized could exist. I may have been a goofy, tall and bulky dork..... But..... I have a near encyclopedic knowledge of Battle Princess Mintaka on my side. Fate may have been throwing me a pity softball on this one, but damned if I wasn't going to swing for the fences on it. So..... Two years, a whole host of convention going, and a lot of learning experiences..... We were still together and I didn't see anything stopping us. She got her dissertation together and defended it. With the Ph. D. in hand and some noted papers published, the university couldn't wait for her to apply for some open positions they'd been dying to fill. I was able to pull a few strings to get into the IT department with the help of an old friend who managed to find himself there after a big career change. So..... The next big step I figured was seeing if she wanted to move in with me. I managed to get a ridiculous price on a foreclosure property, and I had been living there for some time. Silvia is practically here all the time and the rent for anything nicer than a single bedroom apartment around this town is ridiculous. So, 2nd anniversery, I figured..... Why not ask? We decided to keep it simple this anniversary. Giving some craziness that happened during the first one, that Silvia still doesn't feel comfortable talking about..... Simpler is better. A nice day trip to some parts of the state we hadn't seen before, lunch at some place we found on the web, going over to the theatre to see the new Deadpool movie (Her suggestion, I love this woman), and dinner at the usual nice place we go to went we need a little fancy dining to bring up our spirits. We are hanging out on the couch. She's curled up with a blanket in my arms. She looks happy and content. Seems like a successful anniversary so far. I was tempted to put off asking her about moving in. I really didn't want to give Murphy's Law a chance to throw everything for a loop. But, hell..... You got ta know sometime right? \"Hey, Silvia?\" \"Yes?\" \"I was thinking..... You are over here a lot anyway, you need a place to stay in the future, and well..... We've been together for two years. If you are comfortable with it, I'd really like to see how we are together, living in the same place.\" Okay. Logical reasoning presented, reason for the question revealed, and option to gracefully back out allowed. Worst case probably, \"No, let's give it some more time.\" Best case: \"Hell yes!\" The sudden slight shudder of Silvia snapping to full consciousness and the odd feeling of the room's energy changing was not in any of the predicted outcomes. Oh shit, I'd somehow hit a critical snag. Silvia slowly pushes herself up and sits upright on the couch. The blanket slips away and she just sits there in uncomfortable contemplation. This is not good. She's normally a very confident and expressive woman. Seeing her this subdued and nervous..... This was shades of the last anniversary right here. I'm not going to allow that to happen again. \"Hey, there's no pressure or anything. I just figured it might be something to think about. I think everything is going great between you and me. I've got a place, you are looking for a place. And there's no one else who I could think of that'd make this place more of a home for the both of us. If it's too much to ask, just say so. And we'll think about it later and A meek and saddened voice creeps from Silvia, \"I want to. sniff I really do. I just- I just- I just don't know if you'd accept me.\" Okay. I'm confused. \"Accept you? Have I not accepted you before? I accept you as you are before me. There's nothing I can think of that \"I'm a demon.\" \"A what?\" \"Demon.\" \"You get a bit difficult some times, but you're hardly a Silvia shoots up from the couch, turns around to me, and holds her arms to the sides with tears in her eyes, \"sniff I'll show you. It's best for the both of us to make it quick.\" The facade fades away. Silvia's long red hair, turns a silvery white. Her skin goes from the freckled pale to a gray with darker gray markings. Two swept back horns anchored in the sides of her forehead appear. But as strange as what has changed is, she still has that same figure, that beautful face, and the piercing green eyes that are more radiant than ever. \"You know me as Silvia Carter. I'm..... I'm..... I'm Silvianistria Nostromandeus of the 3rd Order of Orion..... Former servant and advisor to the Battlemistress and Queen of the 3rd Order of Orion Lady Oriana Nox.\" She looks at me, expecting a certain reaction. I gaze into those same eyes. She's scared. It actually all makes sense to me now. We got A LOT to talk about. And she's not the only one with a few secrets to tell, but first things first. I take her hands into mine and never breaking eye contact with hers. I crack that smirk that she hates to love, \"If you are the same woman that was nearly late to her dissertation defense because of an argument with me about how there is no way that Battle Princess Mintaka could have used the Gauntlet of the Guardian to defeat Lord Izo..... Then you are the same woman I've loved and will always love.\" This isn't the reaction she expected. After a brief moment of confusion, I witness one of the few moments she's ever been delighted to be absolutely wrong. She gracefully collapses into an embrace around my neck, one of her horns glances me in forehead with a light thunk. That'll take some getting used to. We hold each other and eventually start airing out all our laundry. A few hours later...... \"So, that's me. Once an undisputed master advisor, mage, and alchemist to one of the Queens to the Dark Realms. Then Queen Nox decided to listen to that idiot Wester and got her aass royally kicked and banished to realms that even the darkest mages dare not even chart. Out of work and trapped on Earth.

Great gods, most of Queen Nox's crew were complete perverts. I was so glad that Lord Izo got absolutely annihilated by Mintaka. He ran back to the Dark Realms and I haven't heard a thing about him since.\" \"Grr..... Fucker deserved it.\" \"You really don't like that guy. Every time that name gets brought up you ALWAYS emit this aura of spite and ire, that I never sense from you any other time.\" Shit. Well..... she's got me. Let's get all the laundry hanging out. \"There's a reason. And as a bonus, it'll prove you right.\" This has her attention now. I feel her leaning in and her eyes trying to decipher what I was going to say. \"The Gauntlet of the Guardian didn't leave Lord Izo and jump to Mintaka.\" \"Yes. Because the Gauntlet will only jump on its own to someone trying to defend who they love and care for in their time of greatest need.\" \"Yes..... Ah..... Those scars on my body, those weren't from electrical arcs. They were I don't get a chance to complete my sentence before Silvia is reaching under my shirt and feeling the various scarring I got a long time ago. \"Holy shit!

How did you live through this Silvia hands held my right arm. Her fingertips sweep around. She's finally sensing the residual magic of what was on there. \"You wore the..... THE..... Gauntlet of the Guardian?!\" \"Yes.\" \"The bystander that attempted to save Mintaka and friends in issue 126 where Mintaka finally confronts Lord Izo?\" \"Me.\" \"The gauntlet went to?\" \"Me.\" \"Because WHO were you defending?\" \"My little sister.\" \" ............!!!\" \"Yes.\" I think it'll be a LONG while before I see that degree of shock, confusion, and bewilderment in Silvia's face. And I really hope I'm not the one to cause it next time. I see her bite her lower lip and flash a concerned look my way. \"Do you still want me to come over to your family's place this Thanksgiving? That might be REALLY awkward..... and possibly dangerous.\" \"Don't worry. My sister wasn't good with the sensory powers before, and she hasn't used them in at least ten years. We should be fine.\" \"But, what about Horus her magical cat?!\" \"Don't worry. Horus and I go back. I've helped him out a number of times. He'll keep it quiet.\" Plus, the bastard owes me a big one after nearly getting caught by the magical equivalent of the FBI trying to move his stash of Star Hemp to a new safe place. We both lay on the couch, back to that comfortable and content point again. \"So..... you okay with moving in?\" \"Ha. Yes. I'm actually looking forward to it now.\" \"Cool. Got to admit, it was nice getting everything out there.\" \"No kidding. Strange world we live in. I'm just glad I can finally drop the shape change spell around you.\" \"Speaking of which, you wouldn't happen to have THAT uniform still?\" All I am able to get from Silvia is that evil little grin.", "text_perturb": "It was genus silvia 's and my 2nd anniversary dating together. Despite a really rocky start and some strange moments , things seemed to be conk really well. Our interests , temperments , and yet our crazy sides matched. We met at an gum anime convention.

Well , it was probably the fact she was a fiery red-haired , piercing green eyed , freckled , glasses wearing , anime-interested young cleaning woman with a figure that my baser instincts had only theorized could exist. I may possess been a goofy , tall and bulky dork. . . . . But. . . . . I deliver a near encyclopedic knowledge of Battle Princess Mintaka on my side. Fate may have personify throwing me a pity softball on this one , but damned if I was n't going to swing for the fences on it. thusly. . . . . Two years , a unscathed host of convention going , and a lot of learning experiences. . . . . We were still together and I did n't see anything hold back us. She receive her dissertation together and defended it. With the ph scale. vitamin d. in hand and some remark papers published , the university could n't wait for her to apply for some open positions they 'd been dying to fill. I was able to pull a few strings to get into the IT department with the help of an old supporter who managed to find himself there after a big career change. hence. . . . . The adjacent big step I figured was seeing if she wanted to move in with me. I managed to get a ridiculous price on a foreclosure property , and I had been living there for some clip. Silvia is practically here all the time and the rent for anything nicer than a single bedroom apartment around this ithiel town is ridiculous. So , 2nd anniversery , I calculate. . . . . Why not ask ? We adjudicate to keep it simple this anniversary. pass on some craziness that happened during the first one , that Silvia still does n't feel comfortable talking about. . . . . Simpler constitute better. A nice day trip to some parts of the state we had n't seen before , lunch at some place we found on the web , going over to the theatre to see the new Deadpool movie ( Her suggestion , I love this woman ) , and dinner at the usual nice place we go to went we need a minuscule fancy dining to bring up our spirits. We are hanging out on the sofa. She 's curled up with a blanket in my implements of war. She calculate happy and content. Seems like a successful day of remembrance so far.

Logical reasoning presented , reason for the question revealed , and option to gracefully back up out allowed. Worst vitrine probably , `` No , let 's give it some more time. `` Best case : `` Hell yes ! '' The sudden slight shudder of Silvia snapping to full consciousness and the rum feeling of the room 's energy changing was not in any of the predicted outcomes. Oh shit , I 'd somehow strike a critical snag. Silvia easy pushes herself up and sits upright on the couch. The mantle slips away and she just sits there in uncomfortable contemplation. This is not respectable. She 's normally a very confident and expressive adult female. Seeing her this keep down and nervous. . . . . This was shades of the last anniversary right field here. I 'm not going to allow that to happen once more. `` Hey , there 's no pressure or anything. I just figured it might embody something to think about. I believe everything is going great between you and me. I 've got a billet , you are looking for a billet. And there 's no one else who I could think of that 'd make this place more of a abode for the both of us. If it 's too much to ask , exactly say so.

I 'm unconnected. `` Accept you ? Have I not accepted you before ? I go for you as you are before me. There 's nothing I give notice think of that `` I 'm a demon. `` `` A what ?

{"original_text": "OASIS - Day 1, April 22nd, 2065 Alright. We all managed to touch down without any actual problems. Doesn't seem to be any damage on the ship. Landing gear is okay. Still got enough fuel to get back to orbit. Sara is complaining about how warm it is. I kinda agree with her. While we seem to be in an oasis right now, surrounding us all is just desert. I mean, we knew it was dry but the clouds were too thick to make anything out. Anyway. We're gon na check the composition of the oasis plants, then get some rest. 42 hour day tomorrow. 30 of it is sun. Day 3, April 24th, 2065 Okay, so the plants in this area seem to be angiosperms, with apparently wind as the preferred transfer method. Makes sense, there's an almost constant breeze. Don't know where it'd go, though, apart from here. Water is fine and safe to drink. Seems to be a spring. We're getting the fusion engine ready, but until then rationed power. Reason why I'm writing, actually. Long time since I have. I remember my dad telling me that once they used to actually write in classes. Heh, good old days. Tomorrow we're gon na go on an expedition, see if we can get anywhere. We're preparing some buggies to travel about. We'll use liquid fuels for now, while electricity gets set up. Day 4, April 25th, 2065 Okay, so me and Mike are heading out. The rest of the crew is going to take care of setting shit up, while we go dune buggying. As Mike's driving, I can write. Outside the oasis, the temperature picks up a hell of a lot, up by 10 to 15 degrees, at least. It's already something like 80 in the shade. Kinda wishing I stayed back now. At least there's no wind to blow sand in my face. Day 5, April 26th, 2065 Okay, so me and Mike are fucking screwed, along with finding the reason why the wind had dropped. Sandstorms. I swear to god, tornados were fucking everywhere. We set up emergency shelter, and we're kinda waiting it out. The sound of the storm has stopped. Not the storm itself, though. The sand's burying us, I think. Day 7, April 28th, 2065 Finally, it's stopped. We checked the plexiglass windows, and we know for a fact we are buried. 10 feet, I think. seems pretty hard packed. Mike's MacGyvering some kind of drill together, so we can get out. I think the shelter's a loss. There's no way we could get it out. Oh well, time to dig. Day 8, April 29th, 2065 We made it. Oh god, I have never wanted to feel the wind on my face and the warmth again. We spent 20 hours, digging straight up. We got to a point where it was actually raining down, but we didn't give a fuck, we just climbed up and up and up, sand in our hair and eyes, looking for the cloudy sky. We got everything out of the tent. The buggy is a loss. Mike's trying to get the GPS unit to work. I think the cloud layer is interfering. We also sent up a flare, so we'll see what happens. Day 10, April 30th, 2065 Nothing. While we didn't want to climb back down to the tent, we had to during night. It's fucking freezing. The tent keeps some warmth, at least. GPS is down, and the flares are out. I think we're just going to have to hike back the way we came. We did lay down Helium Markers, so that's good. Thank god for all this equipment. We're running low on food, though. Got enough for about a week, now. Water's good, we've got 2 weeks of that. We're gon na start walking soon. Day 11, May 1st, 2065 Okay, so we hiked for about 25 hours, thanks to the sunlight (so fucking hot) and we managed to build some kind of sand igloo for the night (so fucking cold). Our water is really dropping quickly, and we are getting tired, fast. Thank god we found the Helium Markers. Though. I've never been happier to see one of those red and blue motherfuckers. We're following them along, and we've past 15 by now. Mike says we've got about 30 more to go. This is really taking a toll on him. I mean, he's a pretty heavy guy. He's an engineer, not Markel Louis, 2060 Gold Medalist Long Distance Runner. I feel sorry for him. I try to keep him on the up, though. I'm gon na get the sleep I can now, and try to cover as much ground as possible. Day 13, May 3rd, 2065 MOTHERFUCKER. One of those fucking'storm-proof' Helium Markers got snapped. We're fucked. We put a 5km distance between each of them, and the one we were going to was in the middle of a fucking crater. We're gon na try to follow our steps out. This really has Mike down. Shit, he ain't doing well at all. I mean, yeah, he's lost like 15 lbs, but he is losing water way to quickly. I estimated, and our water is only gon na last 2 more days. Off we go, I guess. Day 14, May 4th, 2065 We ran out of food today. I didn't realize till I reached into the bag that was already empty. We only have a few more liters of water, as well. We got back to our previous Marker, and we're camping there for tonight. On the bright side, I found some actual life on this planet! A huge, 10ft long snake, just slithering around, with a HUGE bulb. That was dinner. We both ate well, and turned out the bulb was filled with water. We'll be okay. Day 15, May 5th, 2065 Okay, so we walked. We have a general idea of where we're going. We know that the missing Marker in the crater is 5km away from last night's Marker. We know the one far away is about 7km away. Using some triangulation magic, we found where we had to go. Hopefully this works out. I gave Mike a larger ration of water. Hopefully he stays up. Day 16, May 6th, 2065 It's not there. We couldn't find it. Not even a severed rope. Did we go to the wrong place? Was the crater not actually a Marker point at all? The sandstorm changed this place so much. I have no sense of bearing. Mike's not taking it well. We're kinda lost here. I guess we're gon na hike back to our campsite, I guess. Day 17, May 7th, 2065 We can't find it. We can't. I can't. Oh fuck oh fuck. We can't find our camp. It's gone. We know it's the same area. It looks the same, has the same mountain in the distance, but no Marker, no camp, no fucking nothing. We only have a day worth of food left. We have no more water. I need to find one of those snake things again, or we're dead. Day 20, May 20th, 2065 Mike is on his last stand right now. He can't handle the lack of food, lack of shade, lack of water. Neither can I, but he's suffering. I caught another snake, much smaller this time, and gave it to him. He ate it raw. Right then and there. I was disgusted. And hungry. So hungry. Day 25, May 25th, 2065 Mike's dying. I think that snake he ate was poisonous. he's green, throwing up, and not moving. We can't afford to waste this time. But he'll die tonight. I know it. I wonder what I'm going to do. Day 26, May 26th, 2065 Mike died last night. I was so hungry..... Day 27 I have to keep moving. Can't think on what I did. If I keep moving, maybe I'll find the Oasis, right? Yeah, then I can finally lie back in the shade, sip on that bottle of 20-year-old Royale whiskey I smuggled on. That'd be great. Day 30 Sand. It's everywhere. It's everything. Sand, made of silicon, made of protons and neutrons and electrons, which also make me up. By that logic, I'm sand, right? Day It's really warm today. I think I'll take off my suit. Night It's cold. I buried myself in sand. Still cold. Day 35, 4th June, 2065 I see it! It's in the distance. Fucking finally. Running hurts a hell of a lot, despite me feeling lighter. Fuck, I need to take a shower. At least I've got some great thighs from this walking. Ugh, am I tired. I'll dive in that spring, surprise everyone. About 100 yards away now. Let's go. End Everything is sand. I'm sand. The Oasis is sand. There is no Oasis, just sand. It's so warm, like being in a fuzzy blanket. I'll sleep now. - Holy fuck, 7766 characters of writing. I felt that ending get to me.", "text_perturb": "OASIS - Day 1 , April 22nd , 2065 Alright. We all managed to touch down without any actual problem. act n't seem to be any damage on the ship. Landing gear is all right. Still got enough fuel to get backward to orbit. Sara make up complaining about how warm it make up. I kinda agree with her. While we seem to be in an oasis right forthwith , surrounding us all is just desert. I entail , we knew it was dry but the clouds were too thick to make anything out. at any rate. We 're gon na delay the composition of the oasis plants , then get some rest. 42  minutes day tomorrow. 30 of it equal sun. Day 3 , April 24th , 2065 Okay , so the plants in this area seem to be angiosperms , with obviously wind as the preferred transfer method. Makes sentience , there 's an almost constant breeze. Do n't cognise where it 'd go , though , apart from here. weewee is fine and safe to drink. Seems to be a springiness. We 're getting the fusion locomotive engine ready , but until then rationed power. Reason why I 'm writing , actually. foresighted time since I have. I remember my dad telling me that in one case they used to actually write in classes. Heh , good old days. Tomorrow we 're gon na go on an expedition , examine if we can get anywhere. We 're preparing some buggies to travel about. We 'll use liquid fuels for straight off , while electricity gets set up. Day 4 , apr 25th , 2065 Okay , so me and Mike are heading out. The rest of the crew embody going to take care of setting shit up , while we go dune buggying. As Mike 's driving , I send away write. Outside the oasis , the temperature break up up a hell of a lot , up by 10 to 15 degrees , at least. It 's already something like 80 in the tint. Kinda wishing I stayed back at present. At least there 's no wind to blow sand in my aspect. Day 5 , April 26th , 2065 Okay , so me and Mike are fucking screwed , along with finding the reason why the wind sustain dropped. sirocco. I swear to god , tornados were fucking all over. We set up emergency tax shelter , and we 're kinda waiting it out. The sound of the storm has lay off. Not the storm itself , though. The sand 's eat up us , I think. Day 7 , april 28th , 2065 Finally , it 's stopped. We tick off the plexiglass windows , and we know for a fact we are buried. 10 ft , I think. appear pretty hard packed. Mike 's MacGyvering some kind of drill in concert , so we can get out. I think the shelter 's a expiration. There 's no way we could get it out. Oh well , time to apprehend. Day 8 , apr 29th , 2065 We made it. Oh god , I have never desire to feel the wind on my face and the warmth again. We drop 20 hours , digging straight up. We got to a point where it was actually raining down , but we did n't give a fuck , we just climbed upwards and upwards and upwards , sand in our hair and eyes , looking for the cloudy sky. We scram everything out of the tent. The buggy is a personnel casualty. Mike 's essay to get the GPS unit to work. I think the cloud layer be interfering. We besides sent up a flare , so we 'll see what happens. Day 10 , apr 30th , 2065 Nothing. While we did n't want to climb back downward to the tent , we had to during night. It 's fucking freezing. The tent retain some warmth , at least. GPS is downwardly , and the flares are out. I think we 're just pass away to have to hike back the way we came. We did set down Helium Markers , so that 's good. Thank supreme being for all this equipment. We 're move low on food , though. Got plenty for about a week , now. Water 's good , we 've got 2 calendar week of that. We 're gon na start walking presently. Day 11 , May 1st , 2065 Okay , so we hiked for about 25 hours , thanks to the sunlight ( so fucking hot ) and we carry off to build some kind of sand igloo for the night ( so fucking cold ). Our water is genuinely dropping quickly , and we are getting tired , fast. Thank idol we found the Helium Markers. Though. I 've never been happier to control one of those red and blue motherfuckers. We 're following them on , and we 've past 15 by now. Mike says we 've commence about 30 more to go. This is really accept a toll on him. I think of , he 's a pretty heavy guy. He 's an engineer , not Markel Louis , 2060 Gold Medalist Long Distance caranx crysos. I feel sorry for him. I seek to keep him on the up , though. I 'm gon na incur the sleep I can now , and try to cover as much ground as possible. Day 13 , may 3rd , 2065 MOTHERFUCKER. One of those fucking'storm-proof ' Helium Markers pay off snapped. We 're fucked. We put a 5km distance between each of them , and the one we were get going to was in the middle of a fucking crater. We 're gon na try to watch over our steps out. This really has microphone down. shite , he ai n't doing well at all. I think , yeah , he 's lost like 15 lbs , but he is losing water way to quickly. I estimated , and our water is only gon na last 2 more than days. Off we go , I suppose. daytime 14 , May 4th , 2065 We ran out of food today. I did n't realize till I reached into the bag that represent already empty. We only sustain a few more liters of water , as well. We flummox back to our previous Marker , and we 're camping there for tonight. On the bright side , I ground some actual life on this planet ! A huge , 10ft long snake , just slithering around , with a HUGE bulb. That constitute dinner. We both ate well , and turned out the bulb was take with water. We 'll make up okay. Day 15 , May 5th , 2065 Okay , so we walk. We have a general mind of where we 're going. We sleep together that the missing Marker in the crater is 5km away from last night 's Marker. We know the one far forth is about 7km forth. Using some triangulation magic , we found where we birth to go. Hopefully this shape out. I gave Mike a larger ration of water. hopefully he stays up. Day 16 , May 6th , 2065 It 's not there. We could n't ascertain it. non even a severed rope. Did we go to the wrong place ? Was the volcanic crater not actually a Marker point at all ? The sandstorm changed this place so much. I sustain no sense of bearing. Mike 's not postulate it well. We 're kinda lost here. I suppose we 're gon na hike back to our campsite , I suppose.  hour interval 17 , May 7th , 2065 We ca n't find it. We ca n't. I ca n't. Oh piece of tail oh piece of tail. We ca n't find our camp. It 's gone. We know it 's the same expanse. It looks the same , possess the same mountain in the distance , but no Marker , no camp , no fucking nothing. We only feature a day worth of food left. We have no more than water. I take to find one of those snake things again , or we 're dead. Day 20 , May 20th , 2065 Mike live on his last stand right now. He ca n't handle the deficiency of food , deficiency of shade , deficiency of water. Neither can I , but he 's put up. I caught another snake river , much smaller this time , and gave it to him. He ate it raw. Right and then and there. I was nauseate. And thirsty. indeed hungry. Day 25 , May 25th , 2065 microphone 's dying. I think that serpent he ate was poisonous. he 's greenish , throwing up , and not moving. We ca n't afford to waste this time. But he 'll expire tonight. I sleep together it. I inquire what I 'm going to do. Day 26 , May 26th , 2065 Mike go bad last night. I was so thirsty. . . . . Day 27 I have to keep proceed. Ca n't cogitate on what I did. If I keep moving , maybe I 'll find the Oasis , right ? Yeah , then I can last lie back in the shade , sip on that bottle of 20-year-old Royale whiskey I smuggled on. That 'd be with child. Day 30 amandine aurore lucie dupin. It 's everyplace. It 's everything. Sand , take in of silicon , take in of protons and neutrons and electrons , which also make me up. By that logic , I 'm sand , right ? daylight It 's really warm today. I recall I 'll take off my suit. Night It 's cold blooded. I buried myself in backbone. Still cold. day 35 , 4th June , 2065 I see it ! It 's in the distance. Fucking last. Running hurts a hell of a bunch , despite me feeling lighter. Fuck , I need to take a cascade. At least I 've got some swell thighs from this walking. Ugh , make up I tired. I 'll dive in that natural spring , surprise everyone. About 100 yards away straightaway. get 's go.

Even the river didn't make the right sound. It's like they turned the volume of everything down in intensity. It felt unnatural.

Normally when adventurers make their way into my sanctum they come in groups, set traps, and blather on and on about righteousness. It is exceedingly rare to to find one a cut above the rest. \"What makes this ring valuable to yourself more than me?\" I asked with some mild curiosity. \"It is a magical ring that when worn can transform you into what I desire most. You are too large to use such a trinket.\" The human reasoned. \"Interesting...\" I mused. \"What value in such a thing, what could you possibly offer in exchange for a magical ring?\" \"I am not a noble nor royal but anything that you desire that I can produce will be yours.\" The human said sitting crossed legged below my alter. Again its hair struck my eyes, long and golden obviously groomed for many years and kept free of tangles, blades, and briars. \"I desire but one thing. Cut your golden locks and add them to my hold.

I must admit in my old age I have forgotten where every individual item has settled in my hold. The human took out a small scroll and read from it words that were foreign to me. I heard the rustle of gold coins and a small brass ring with a ruby set upon it levitated out of the horde and into the air. Now was my chance. Quickly I began to transform into the form that I have avoided when possible. A tall slender black haired main with pale skin and long red robes. I snatched the ring out of the air and landed softly before the warrior. \"You can use it once I have taken my turn.\" I cackled. Slipping the ring on I immediately meditated on my own form, scales stronger than ever, breath hotter with teeth and claws sharper and longer than before yet years reset to that of young adulthood. I could feel the rings energy flowing through me and I closed my eyes. I felt my body rippling and strengthening..... stiffening? In horror I opened my eyes to see my body slowly changing into gold, from foot up it climbed. I quickly attempted to pull the ring off but my arms were already growing heavy and stiff. I looked to the human with such rage. \"What is this sorcery! I should have known not to trust a human.\" I sputtered. Already my lungs were stiffening and breath was becoming shallow. \"There was no deception on my part wyrm. It is transforming you into what I want the most.

As the mascara streaked down my face, creating rivers of black tears; Nellie did not move and as I collapsed onto the floor, she gently fell next to me. Maybe it was her own love for Tom that gave her a deeper understanding of my pain. He had chosen her and driven the 3 hours to surprise me on my birthday. Tom had been the one who walked and played with her day after day as I lay in bed crippled with sadness after finding out I was unable to bare children. And although Tom took many business trips, Nellie clearly understood this trip was different. She understood that he was never coming home and yet her strength in supporting me was unaltered and altruistic. The months went by and Nellie became my best friend. While our love for Tom initially brought us together, it was force of fate that made me realize Nellie was my saving grace. It was her undying acceptance that pushed my hand into accepting myself, and it was her unfaltering love that provided me with hope. My desire to have children would never leave me but the void was filled by that little black lab, and she gladly played the part of my furry, four legged baby. Almost giddily I bought steaks at the deli, tonight for dinner we would celebrate Nellie's second birthday. I pictured her big brown eyes lighting up when she heard the meat hit the skillet, and her leaning ever so patiently against my leg as I finished cooking it. My joyful daydream quickly diminished as I rounded the corner to my small house. Something felt wrong. Nearing the front door I noticed it was slightly ajar. As my heart began to race I called out to her. My mind panicking, I reassured myself that Nellie would soon come bounding out to greet me; after all she was never one to wander away and was well trained to always stay in the confines of our front yard. My stomach churned as I opened the door and called for her once again. Nothing. The rest of the night was a blur. The thieves had ransacked my home, taking TVs, jewelry and of course what petty cash they could find. As I picked up my belongings I realized that the only missing thing I cared about was Nellie. Why would they take my dog? What were they doing to her? Had she been tired of being left alone while I worked and gladly followed them out of my life? I found myself crippled in my sorrows once again. This time I had nothing left. I had never been part of a family and was not quick to make friends. I had Tom and Nellie; now they were both gone. I found a bottle of whiskey in the cupboard and sat down to drown my sorrows. Hungover and depressed the next day I called into work. They could find someone else to write the news, I had a date with daytime soaps and a bottle of Jack. And while I knew this was only a temporary fix, I also knew that my mind would be unable to think of anything except how much I missed those big brown eyes. Months went by and each day got a little easier. Although no one could replace Tom, I even remarried a great man named Alex. It was a whirlwind romance that helped heal my heart from the devastating losses. I threw myself into my career and was quickly moving up the journalism ladder. When I uncovered what I believed to be an embezzlement scandal at the County funded drug rehabilitation center \"Renew\" I was thrilled. Of course this would be a tragedy for our community but I felt championed in my position as expose writer. This was not a story that I could half ass and I made it my duty to get every detail. I could barely sit still as I sat in the lobby of Renew waiting to meet with it's director. The bell on the front door would jingle as nurses and visitors funneled in and out of the building. In my own world, I barely acknowledged their presence until a wet cold nose nuzzled it's way under my hand, bumping it off the paper as I wrote. Glancing down I saw nothing but beautiful brown eyes staring up at me. \"Get over here, Angel!\" A young man pulled on the other end of the leash. \"I'm real sorry mam' she's not usually up in other peoples business but I guess she ain't afraid to bother you!\" I stared in disbelief. It was Nellie, there was no doubt in my mind. I reached out my hand to touch her, as I did she let out a happy whimper. Immediately dropping my journal I kneeled onto the floor to hug her. Tears filled my eyes as I turned to the young man. Trying to find the right words I studied him. He couldn't have been older than 25 but his face bore the marks of many struggles. His over sized clothes reaked of cigarette smoke. He gave me an awkward smile. \"I guess you like dogs huh?\" he half stated, half asked. \"Where did you get this dog?\" was all I could choke out. \"Someone gave her to me, why do you care?\" he seemed agitated by my quick interest and overwhelming love for his dog. As he started to pull on the leash I quickly came gathered my thoughts and backed off a little bit. Nellie nudged my hand again as I asked; \"Sorry I was just wondering where you got this incredible dog?\" His face softened and he relented. \"I used to be a patient here, someone found this poor pup in a drug house. They brought her here as a therapy dog. I don't know if we saved her or she saved me, but cause of her I ain't had any slip ups in 6 months now!\" Just as quickly as my heart had began racing my stomach began to sink.

{"original_text": "The first months were the most shocking ones, afterwards everything calmed down, albeit slowly. The \"aliens\" as we called them at first were very clearly related to us biologically. At least some of them. Some others were completely different, but we didn't meet many of those for obvious reasons. The first step to building a good relationship was learning and teaching our respective languages, albeit they were quite familiar with our earthly tongues. So our groups were mostly taught Amambwe, Lysano, and Thindlurrinni, three of the most common languages of the newcomers. \"Whatever is the reason they are visiting us?\" Anne asked me. \"We don't know yet,\" I replied. Although I had pondered that for quite too long, I couldn't really come to a conclusion. They weren't threatening, they weren't exchanging information -other than linguistic ones, that is. Their coming was unknown to us, but welcome they were. Not that we didn't have groups of nut-jobs walking around the streets demonstrating. But if they had met the \"aliens\" face to face, they'd feel otherwise. These ones were almost exactly like humans, but they radiated an otherworldiness that can't be put down to words. Was it their scrutinising gaze? The fact that they smiled too much? The fact that they could speak our languages almost perfectly? \"Is everything going alright?\" Ansemi asked me. \"Oh, you startled me!\" I replied. \"Yeah, everything's fine.\" The way these..... people? Sure. The way these people could creep up on you was uncanny. They almost made no sound whatsoever. \"I didn't mean to\" he said in Lyseno. \"It is okay,\" I replied in my broken speech which he didn't mock. \"Lilly,\" he said, \"I wanted to ask you something. \"Only if you let me ask you something in return\" I said. \"You know I'm not allowed. Not yet.\" \"Yeah, I know\" I sighed. \"Sure, ask me.\" I could feel Anne's gaze from across the room. \"Would you like to asswinnento with me?\" \"To what?\" I didn't know that word. \"To go out with me. To have a date.\" I pondered for a second. \"I don't think it would be...\" \"Before you refuse, I have an offer to make. If you come, I'll answer as many questions as I can. It's not much, I know. But it will definitely be more than you already know now.\" His smile was disarming. Three hours later, we were sitting in a small restaurant near my university, with small round tables and cozy colours. Whether the music playing was lounge or some kind of jazz, I couldn't tell. Ansemi was handsome as ever, and his attire was impeccable, if only a bit overdressed. Or was I the one who thought this would be more casual. \"So, Lilly,\" he said and drank a sip of wine, \"I guess you have many questions, but so do I. I hope you don't mind.\" \"Not at all,\" I said, as long as you provide me with enough info. \"Shall I go first?\" I said. He nodded. \"Are humans and your people related?\" \"Yes, indeed. We are very closely related.\" \"Is panspermia correct?\" \"That I do not know, but it might as well be. Now it's my turn. Do you like me?\" \"Oh, blunt. Alright, I can play that game.\" I smiled. \"Well \"Are you ready to order?\" asked the young waitress. \"Beef tartare, smoked cheddar, chestnut,\" Ansemi said. I was about to order a cheeseburger, but with that I changed my mind. \"I'll have the same, thanks.\" \"So,\" sighs Ansemi with a big bright smile. \"Yes. Indeed, I can't deny that you're a good-looking fella,\" I reply, without actually answering his question. But it seems it's enough for him. \"Did you come to destroy us or take us out for expensive dinners?\" I asked. He laughed. \"We didn't come to destroy you, no. We have come to build an alliance between our people and yours. And of course, we'll help you technologically.\" \"But you'll want something in return.\" \"Naturally,\" he said, \"but whether or not you do help us, we'll still help you and our alliance won't change nonetheless.\" \"May I ask what it is that you're after?\" \"This is confidential.\" \"I shall never speak of it.\" \"Our people can not reproduce. We shall ask your people's representatives for reproductive cells. We know you already donate male cells, so I don't think it would be that much of a deal.\" \"I don't think so either,\" I frown, \"but then how did you come into being?\" \"My turn to make a question,\" he smiled. \"Have you ever been married?\" \"Yes. Once. It didn't last. He was a bastard.\" You looked at me quizzically. \"I kid! I mean, I was married, yes. But he wasn't a bastard. It just didn't work out. We were too young and too carrier-driven to even notice that our marriage was falling apart. Until, we did. So we ended it.\" He nodded. His questions were always intimate. Mine were never that. So I changed my tactic. \"Do you have a family back there, on your planet?\" \"No, not really. I have a clan though,\" he said. \"A clan of brothers and sisters. Most of them work as farmers now though.\" \"What do they do there, make crop circles? \" I asked, saying the last word in English, for I didn't think there might be an equivalent. \"Excuse me?\" he asked. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" I said, I didn't mean to offend.\" \"No, I mean. I don't know that word.\" Curious, I wondered. The derivation was obvious, crop circle. His English was exceptional. So, I try to improvise. \"You know, like vistammyne,\" I said, quite literally,'round thing'. \"Vistammyne on field crops.\" For the first time he lost his smile. \"What do you know about those? Where did you get this information?\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked, kinda scared. The waitress comes with our dishes. No one thanked her, despite her politeness. \"I'm not sure what you're asking,\" I said. \"I just made a joke, but I'm sorry if I offended you.\" \"How do you know about vistammyne? Who told you?\" \"No one told me! Crop circles have been a pop culture thing in like forever!\" I reply in English, so that I could make sure none of my words would be interpreted any differently from what I'd intended. \"Are you serious?\" he asked. I take out my iPhone, google \"crop circles\" and show him the picture results. \"I I have to go!\" he replied and left me there. The alien just had a case of Runaway Bride.

This isn't like that, though. When I woke up, nothing was different for me. World wide, nothing seemed different for anyone. No one realized overnight, or even within the first week. It took weeks, months even, for people to realize and come to terms with what happened. I was young when it happened. Fifteen, hardly at my prime, and there was so much adjustment. Men had been the dominant force in the world, mostly due to the fact that they were stronger and faster. A trait that really only mattered in a more medieval setting, mind you, but old habits died hard. Throughout bouts for equality and calls for reform, women never truly caught up. Thing was, though, that people had a funny way of adjusting to what was new. Our entire lives are spent getting over stuff. War, death, crime and poverty. Movies and TV shows that depict the end of days, and people stop wincing when a couple thousand are cropped off a population of billions. For some reason, people expected this to be any different. It was strange, yes, that men were suddenly the weaker species. Women didn't get any stronger, however. Men universally got weaker. Shred from their physical prowess without so much as a warning, the world took some time to adjust. It wasn't merely about stepping back and allowing women to take the lead. Everything, daily and trivial things no one had thought about before, had to be rethought. Road work, construction, menial labor, mines, war, all of which men had no real superiority in other than their natural given power. And yet, when they were less than a quarter the strength (on average) as women, women couldn't merely pick up the slack. They tried, but these were tasks designed for a strength that just wasn't naturally met. Women, though, were smart. The world changed faster than it ever did with men on top. With all the jokes about how we'd never get anything done once a month, the progress never seemed to slow down. A lot of people expected payback. For men to be treated as lesser, given the \"housewife\" treatment as most reality hosts called it. That was never the case from what I saw. Men were treated the same, if not with a little pity thrown in. Still respected, still thought of as equals by a vast majority of the female race. There were always exceptions, but that was with any rule. Men just had to get use to a world where their strength was a hindrance. I did not. I never felt the transition, though it wasn't just because of my age. In school, I would lift things for our teacher that even she thought was too heavy. At home, Mother and Father had to adjust to my being able to move things about the house at a whim. Of course Mother could do it, but not with the ease that I was able to demonstrate. As I grew older, my strength only increased. As the years passed, and I was an extremely active young man, my natural abilities were increasing exponentially. I worked out every single day I could, while attempting not to demonstrate too much of my strength in school. No one knew, not even my best friends, how strong I truly was. No one could tell just by looking at me either. Men were weaker, but their bodies were still capable of appearing toned and muscular. No, I looked no different than the rest of the men, and yet I was so very different. The history books say that the average man was two and a half times as strong as the average woman. I'd estimate I was stronger, faster, more agile than most men from that time now. My parents saw it as a freak accident, something my future family would one day find impressive. People in the past could notice obvious superiority in those with the utmost fitness. UFC fighters, special forces, all of which were strong in a time where anyone could achieve it. As far as I know, I'm the last human being in the world who is capable of this sort of strength before evolution catches back up.

I didn't really think anything of it other than a cool summer storm and a nice cup of hot chocolate on my porch. My husband had come home from work early due to him having a killer headache. My mom said it was probably the sudden change in weather; she also had some conspiracy theory about it being the government. My mom is a very interesting person. \"Michelle, do you want more hot chocolate?\" Tyler asked, motioning to the almost emptied cup resting upon my pregnant belly. I was almost 35 weeks, and I wanted to die. \"No I'm good love. How's your head?\" I replied, reaching over to rub the top of his thigh. I listened as the ocean waves lapped against the rocky shore beneath our porch. This was my paradise. If I were lucky, I'd see a whale or dolphin pop up here and there. Today, not so much. Just before Tyler could answer, a bright light flashed up in the sky. \"What the fuck was that? My mom asked from the kitchen window. \"It was lightning mom!\" I yelled back. \"Michelle, that's not lightning. There would be thunder...\" Tyler murmured to me. Out of nowhere, a loud boom sounded.

I waddled into the sliding glass door and he shut and locked it behind us. \"Shut the window ma,\" he instructed my mom. \"Why what's going on?\" My mom started to panic, I could see it in her eyes. \"Is it a nuke?!\" She was on level nine freak out. \"No. Mom, it looked like..... it looked like a ship...\" I explained, my words shaking. \"Like a boat or like a pew pew ship?\" She asked as she did finger-guns and twirled her hand above her greying head. \"The second one. I know this will sound crazy but...\" Tyler trailed off, his face conveying shock. \"But what?!\" I asked, lightly beating on his chest. \"Michelle, look outside..\" My head panned from his face to the sliding glass door, and what I saw astounded me. The water was no longer rough and choppy, but was calm. And still. It was like time was paused. \"This will sound crazy but Porter was talking about this. How they, NASA, contacted Dr. David and said they needed help with identifying some sort of foreign specimen they found on that asteroid that crashed in Reno. It had unknown traces and..... DNA from a killer whale. I laughed it off, thought that it might have been a mistake. But I think that it's right. I think they're stealing our sea life. All those dead fish, whales, everything that have washed up lately on the beach.... It's not because of natural causes. I had to keep this under wraps but this.... This proves it. We had no cause as to why they were all dying because they were all healthy. We named it as natural causes to not solicit any fear but.... This puts two and two together.\" Mom and I were speechless. I felt Ava kick in my stomach and I feared for her life. \"Are they gon na come to us?\" I asked after a few seconds. Tyler shook his head. \"They already would have. They have no interest in us. They want the salt and blood from the sea. They want the meat and bones. The ones that washed up had weird bite marks in their abdomens and were missing their spines.

{"original_text": "Mohammed Peterson eased himself into a chair in the corner of a conference room. He liked coming early, since he was still new at the Centers for Disease Control. Being early demonstrated he was diligent and organized, two important qualities in a lab researcher. He also liked sitting in the corner, since it meant he could quietly mumble the names of those entering to himself. It was an exercise he learned in graduate school. He was bad with names, but that just meant he had to do more to remember them. Other researchers filed in, along with a few Senators, Congressmen, and military men. Sen. Mary Bunch of Utah and House Speaker Tatiana Zaitsev were the last to enter. They were the reason this team was assembled, and it took them seven years to finally make it to a team meeting. It had a name that seemed both august and bureaucratic - typical of the sensibilities of the Terran Coalition: The Intergalactic Tournament Molecular Biology Working Group. As Mary and Tatiana sat down Gen. Allen Carter of the Joint Chiefs of Staff addressed the group. He was always eager to get down to business. \"I know all of you are still busy even though we're switching gears on this project - development to refinement. However you may have noticed we have two special guests with us today. Senator Mary Bunch and Speaker Tatiana Zaitsev are here to learn some of the technical details of the organism the BWG has created. Dr. Kelley, can you bring us up to speed in a few minutes?\" Dr. Thomas Kelley, an industrious Scot with little hair left after a career in government medicine, led the Biology Working Group, shortened to BWG. He nodded slightly and addressed Tatiana and Mary directly. \"Our team, armed with the generous support you've convinced Congress to grant us, has been able to do more than achieve our goal - we've done it under budget and ahead of schedule.\" Mohammed suppressed a snort.

Past success means future grant funding is easier to get, after all. Kelly continued, \"The BWG was tasked with creating an organism that could infect and debilitate organisms originating from any of the 13 other planets that participate in the Galactic Tournament, but not those from Earth. We were able to exploit the bias of Earth-life toward the use of DNA and RNA to create a fast-growing virus that can reproduce at a tremendous pace - quickly enough to act within the seven-day tournament period. The mechanism of action is the a rapid depletion of body iron, which triggers a voracious appetite for metal-rich foods. The iron is secreted away in multiple areas of the body until approximately 72 hours after initial infection. At that time, the organism begins accreting iron around itself and moves to areas of heat. Body heat is generated in all of the 701 predators that have been submitted to the tournament since it began, and it's always found in two biological areas - the pump that circulates nutrients and the organ responsible for cognition. In humans, these are the heart and the brain. Our clinical trials have demonstrated this virus is 99.9 lethal after five days.

Most of what happens in here is really just the continuations of old problems my husband used to tell me about. \" \" He wouldn't have heard about this issue, as we didn't know about it before 2002. \" he said. \" Also, I should remind you that this subject is on a strictly need-to-know basis, so you might not want to discuss it with your husband. \" Hillary almost chuckled at his little cliche, but something told her that this was serious. The man before her was very well composed and obviously experienced. He did not seem to be impressed with meeting the president for the first time. \" So what is this about? My calender only mentions your name and that you are a scientist of some unspecified sort. \" she said. \" Well, that is true, although I would put more on my business card, if I had one. I am the director of a research institution that was founded in late 2002 to examine an object of alien origin. \" he said. Hillary knew that many scientists mused about the possibility of aliens, but she had never been interested in that discussion. She knew she should probably be excited about the fact that alien life was apparently confirmed, but she had gotten used to the president-routine now and quickly got on with the practical details. \" Okay. Interesting. How expensive is it and what results have you come up with? \" she asked bluntly. \" It is very expensive. Currently we are using about 100 billion dollars annually, and it used to be higher. \" he said. He looked down for a short moment and then continued. \" And as for the results, we are only working on containment, and it is successfully being contained. .\" That was a large number. She should have noticed such an amount of money in the budgets. \" I am pretty familiar with the government finances. How do you manage to get that amount of money? I'm pretty sure I haven't seen'Alien research' on any of the budget proposals. \" she said with a smile. \" We get it through the military spending of the State Department. \" he said. Well the State Department spending did go up 350 billion between 2002 and 2010 but.... \" But how did you get it while the war in Iraq was going on? \" she inquired. \" The war wasn't as expensive as reported. So we just got the extra overhead. \" he replied. Hillery hoped this wasn't the only reason they had gone to Iraq. \" Okay. You said you were working on containment only? What kind of object is this? \" \" Yes, \" he said \" The object is a perfect cube about 1 meter across. We discovered it in the middle of a meteor crater surrounded by a 5 meter thick spherical shield. The inner part of the shield was made of gold and the outer part was made of a very heat resistant and durable alloy. \" Hillary didn't care much for the technical aspects, but it seemed well rehearsed, so she didn't interrupt. \" But although the shield was very resistant against blunt force impact, it was easy enough to cut open. So in 2004, we did. We accounted for everything, and prepared for the worst. Even if the cube had been made out of antimatter, the bunker would have contained the explosion. At first, after we opened the sphere, it was rather anticlimactic. Just a black cube, covered in a slimy substance. After a few minutes our initial analysis showed that the substance contained an acid, perfect for dissolving the explosion-proof container we had made. We quickly encapsulated it in a plastic container, that the acid should have been inert to, but after a few minutes the substance changed properties and started dissolving the plastic. \" he explained. Mr. Smith shrugged his shoulders and continued. \" We ended up placing it inside the original gold container again. \" That did sound anticlimactic. \" So I guess that accounts for the expenses up to 2004. What did you do afterwards? \" Hillary asked. \" Well, after we had closed up the gold shell, we detected an extremely small vibration from inside. It turns out, that the substance contained micro machinery which was drilling through the gold. This seemed strange since it could have done that before we brought it in. However, it became clear that this object was harvesting energy from the environment and using this to break down the gold. We discovered it because it drilled far less in the gold after we turned off the lights when replacing the shield. \" Mr Smith explained. \" Soon after it completely stopped drilling. We hoped that it meant that it had run out of energy, which could perhaps allow us to do more experiments on it. But after a few months of being in the same container, it suddenly started making its microscopic holes in the gold like it was drilling through butter. We just barely avoided a containment breach, and afterwards we found out, that it had probably harvested energy from combination of two things. A small thermal gradient, and vibration energy from a motor running nearby. \" \" A thermal gradient? \" Hillary asked with one eyebrow raised. Now she had let him talk uninterrupted for long enough. Scientists often seemed to have a habit of sliding into an overly technical jargon when they had been talking for too long. \" Sorry, it's when there are two different temperatures on each side of an object. It can be used to generate energy, but it's usually in so tiny amounts that - \" \" Okay ,\" Hillary interrupted before he could get going again. \" So it seems like it wants to escape, and you are trying to contain it, although it's proving to be difficult. \" \" Yes, but the fact that it suddenly started storing its energy instead of constantly drilling, implies that it understands, that it is being contained and it is getting smarter about escaping. This caused us to ramp up the security. There now are quite a lot of layers of different protection mechanisms in place. \" Mr. Smith clarified. Hillary could see the difficulties, but it did not seem to make sense. Why was it trying to escape? \" Have you tried communicating with it? \" She asked. \" Well, we have tried. We drill small holes in the gold shield to interact with the object and send in signals. Mostly low power, low frequency communication, as we don't want to give it energy. So far the only response we have gotten is dissolving equipment. \" he said while shrugging his shoulders again. \" We don't know what it's for or why it's here on earth. We do have some ideas, and they seem to universally conclude that keeping the object isolated from its surroundings is the best course of action. \" \" Can you elaborate on the ideas? How can you possibly conclude anything from an object that doesn't communicate? \" Hillary asked sceptically. \" Well, we know it was sent to earth in a shell that isolated the object. So someone, somewhere thought that sending it without a prison was a bad idea. The question is, why not just throw it into the sun, if they didn't want it to be free? Were they afraid that it would harvest all the energy instead of breaking? But then why not send it out of the galaxy? \" Mr. Smith mused. \" Maybe it is intelligent and destructive. The civilization that banished it might be so peaceful, that they could not get themselves to sentence it to death as they should have. \" \" It could also be a friendly gift, wanting to help create peace on earth and the only reason it doesn't just explain this to us is because it doesn't have enough energy to maintain coherent thoughts. The shield might just have been a wrapping to protect it from the dangers of interstellar travel. But who is going to give the order to release it and see if it is indeed merciful? \" \" Maybe it's like a timed bomb; when monkeys get smart enough to open it, it will kill them all. Whoever sent it could be afraid of competition between intelligent species. And they just hadn't expected anyone to be as cautious as us. There is just no way to really know \" Hillary agreed. The choice was flipping a coin with all of humanity at risk. Heads; it is peace on earth, tails; it is destruction of mankind. Earth is well enough off not to flip that coin. \" Thank you for the briefing, please continue your work. \" she said.

The hedges were overgrown, and the paths were barely visible now. Still, it was clear how magnificent the maze had been, once upon a time. The old knight's face seemed remorseful, his eyes distant, as if remembering those times. In the pond two koi fish danced around each other. One of them was gold, and the other black. The water would flicker with their colours as the sun glinted off their scales, and every time it did so a little rumble would send the water on the surface trembling, and sparks would fly out from the middle of the two fish. From down the path to the knight's left a rabbit emerged from underneath the hedgerow. Cautiously, sniffing the air, it determined that the maze was deserted and came out further. It was very fluffy and grey. The old knight stayed still, and the rabbit did not notice him. The rabbit foraged silently, its head buried in the grass. The way to the old knight's position was a singular path, paralleled on both sides by rose bushes. The roses grew in all different colours, on the same bush, from indigo to yellow and all the spectrum in between. Upon closer inspection, one would find that the petals were made of glass. It was said that in the middle of the maze was a fountain, or a tree. No one could decide which, as it was arguably both. The water spread upwards from the base, twisting and bubbling, until it rained down again in drips like a heavy rain, or the branches of a willow tree. No one knew what drinking from the fountain would do, not even the knight. No one had found the fountaintree for a long time. And eventually, people had stopped trying to find it. They were more likely to find the bodies of previous attempters, skeletons petrified in their final crawl, perhaps a finger stretched out, trying to point the way. Their skeletons rusted in the dew.

It's beak pierced the very middle, and the threads closed around her like a tattered cloak. She thrashed weakly as dozens of spiders revealed themselves amongst the leaves, shaking their spears and cheering. Music could be heard, simple tones that echoed over the maze, drifting closer and receding. The knight waited, and the music revealed itself as a dragonfly flew around one corner. It flew so fast, and turned at right angles, and each time it did so a tone rang out. A long time ago, a musical troop had tried to navigate the maze by mapping the tones to certain corners, as they had discovered a pattern. Nevertheless, they failed.

Isn't this just a sixteen hour shift? he had asked Karen, his manager. She said she was only working to help pay for college, but the way she looked and the way she smelled, well, damn if she weren't dancing over at Maybeline's, because her curves banged like an accident. But it rained, dollops of cold from a Northwest sky, because of course it did, anything to make this day suck just a little bit harder. He took out his phone, a T-Mobile distro of Android called Lime Jello Pop, because when life's gon na suck, it sucks right down to to the bitter little details.

'' She had a pitiful looking at on her face , as if she had been caught steeling from a cookie jar. `` All that fake moaning tinkers damn. Do I look dumb to you ? I'otta not pay you at all ! '' The hooker reeled back as if hit by a right hand hook. `` I ai n't fakin. do the weak reply. william harvey let out a snort , `` That might work on some of your other clients. But you do n't have me arse around. `` Harvey perch up a cigar , second-hand smoke be damned. If he had been a feudal king , he 'd execute this bitch for trying to play a tomfool out of him. william harvey did , in fact , think of himself as a king. Except in a dissimilar sort of way. He had king , but not absolute king. And using his power to make this hooker disappear was n't really worth the trouble , but he did remember about it briefly. Harvey threw a bundle of hard currency on the bed. `` Take this and get the infernal region out of here. `` `` No tip ? '' The girlfriend said , a little teary eyed. `` What the fuck did I say ? ! '' william harvey said almost shouting. The hooker got her things and lead in a hurry , not wanting to be caught in arms reach of an angry client. The door closed behind her , and Harvey equal glad. She was probably somewhat new to this variety of trade. She did n't know when to shut up. Another women that does n't cognise her place , just like his wife. Maybe he would test fixing that. . . . . Regardless , he would have to probably extend his `` business '' trip , just so he could take some other escort service to hook him up again. He had to wash out the terrible taste he acquire from this most recent one. Its not like money was an issue , he did own a pharmaceutic company after all. It did n't bother Harvey in the slightest that the people who were ill ante up for his out-of-town adventures. As long as people still got sick , he would be in business , and that become Harvey just fine. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "For my first thirty sum odd years of existence I never really gave any thought to the notions of God, the supernatural, or even extraterrestrial life. I was the kind of person who had to see something happen right before my eyes to believe that it actually happened. I grew up in a small Alaskan town near the coast that you've probably never heard of. The town was relatively close to a nearby oil rig and it wasn't uncommon to see drifters come and go looking for employment on the rig or one of the many fishing and crabbing vessels. The people in my town were as rough as the strenuous life they lived. Like I said, it wasn't uncommon to meet people from all over the world searching for work. I became friends with many of them and even enemies with a few. However, one drifter in particular left such an impression that he changed the very fundamentals of everything I thought I knew. Larry arrived in our town in late February that year. Earlier that year there was an explosion on the oil rig that was caused by some natural gas or something, I don't really understand how all of that stuff works, and the whole thing was pretty much destroyed but miraculously the crew had survived. I ran a little bar in the town, not much to look at, but it was the only watering hole for 50 miles in every direction. One morning as I was sweeping outside the bar, cleaning up from the night before, a face approached me that I had never seen before which like I said isn't at all uncommon in my town. \"Can I help you?\" I said, \"Sorry to bother you this early, but I'm new in town and recently unemployed.\" He said. \"I was just wondering if maybe you're hiring, I'm not too proud for any job that you could give me.\" I actually wasn't hiring at the moment and to be honest I couldn't really afford to hire anyone else, but I really felt sorry for the guy. \"I guess he can help out bussing tables and bar hopping.\" I thought. The military had also recently moved into the area doing some kind of weather research about 20 miles north, and the soldiers had begun to flock to my place. I figured maybe I could use the extra help. He was a pretty big guy as well, about 6'4 and looked strong as an ox. Every now and then a drifter would come in who thought he was a hard ass so having this guy around to settle a few scores wouldn't hurt either. \"We'll I could use someone to help out around here as a matter of fact.\" \"I can't pay you very much, but I do have an extra room above the bar that you can stay in if you'd like.\" I said. \"That'd be great.\" He said. \"When can I start?\" \"Well first I need to know your name.\" I said. \"Larry\" he said. \"Nice to meet you.\" Larry was a better worker than I had ever imagined. He was hard-working, polite, and the guy never seemed to get tired. All of the regulars loved him and we became pretty good friends too. I decided to take Larry with me to a mechanic that I knew in a town about thirty miles east. My truck's transmission light had been on for a while and I decided to have it looked at. The night before there had been some really heavy snowfall and the roads were in terrible condition. We came around a curve in the road and saw that someone had missed the curve and ran their truck off the road about 50 yards into a healthy pine tree. The truck was completely wrapped around the tree and the tree had fallen on top of the truck as well. We pulled over and ran to the truck as quickly as we could. In the passenger seat we saw and older man slumped to the side and bleeding pretty badly, but he was breathing. The way the truck was wrapped around the base of the tree and the way that the rest of it was on top of the truck there was no way to get the man out. The man was seriously injured and losing blood fast. \"Go back to the truck and close your eyes.\" Larry said in a tone I had never heard before. \"WHAT?!\" \"Do it.\" \"Now.\" He said. Dumbfounded, I reluctantly walked back to the truck, both angry and confused, and did what he said. Well, not completely. I watched. What I saw, I could not believe. Larry walked over to the truck and like you or I might lift a 20 pound dumbbell, he lifted that massive tree trunk off the top of the truck. I was in disbelief. What he did next was even more remarkable. He then proceeded to unwrap the truck from around the tree WITH HIS HANDS. When Larry walked back over to my truck holding the barely breathing man in his arms he could tell by the look on my face that I had not done as he said. After he laid the man in the backseat of my truck he got in on the passenger side of the truck and and with an inexplicable look of almost shame in his eye said, \"forget what you saw, and never speak of it.\" At that point I knew that Larry was unlike anyone else on this planet. Over the next few months feats like this continued to occur. Each time Larry seemed more and more reluctant to perform them. We never spoke of any of them and I could tell in eyes that he appreciated my silence on the subject. Larry began showing up at work In the mornings having not slept the night before. I knew this because he was never at his apartment above the bar. I watched him from my house across the street take off north every night. On foot. To the north there was absolutely nothing but an old, dilapidated road for the next 20 or so miles. Every morning as I was cleaning up from the night before I would see him come walking down that road towards the bar. I still don't know exactly what he was doing or we he was going but I suspected it had something to do with that military research going on up north. I will never forget the last night I saw Larry. A trucker hauling freshly cut timber stopped in to have a few drinks with his buddies that evening. This guy had come in a few times before and he was a real asshole every time. I had recently hired a new waitress and he decided to make it a priority that night to harass her as much as possible. Both Larry and I, were ready to throw this guy out but she told us not to worry and that she had dealt with pricks before and this guy was no different. The next time she went over there the guy decided to grab her ass and that was it. Larry was steaming and looked over at me and I have him the \"throw his ass on the street\" nod. Larry walked over there and said \"Thats enough.\" \"What are you gunna do about it?\" Said the trucker. \"Well then I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\" The guy then took his glass of beer and threw threw it in Larry's face. Larry never budged but, the guy wasn't through yet. He became angry and shoved Larry as hard as he possibly could. Larry didnt move an inch and in fact the guy bounced back off of Larry. Larry then turned around and began to walk off when suddenly a beer can came hurdling in and hit him in the back of the head. Larry walked towards the door and before he went outside gave me a wink that I will never forget. That was the last time I ever saw Larry. However, when we walked outside something unimaginable had unfolded. The truckers truck was 20 feet in the air, impaled by a string of telephone polls. I can not begin to accurately describe what we saw out there. I do know, however, who was responsible. I walked up the short flight of stairs to Larry's apartment and everything was still there but I knew he wouldn't be back.

It was funny really. Without the outcasts to sweep, mine and toil the citizens would have no crafts or livelihoods with which to placate the high class. And if they were not placated then they would skip the citizens and merely execute a few dozen outcasts. Surely if that continued then a time would come when there were no outcasts to toil, then who would they slaughter? Probably not the citizens, because it wasn't their fault that the Gods had vanished three centuries ago. Oh no, that was the outcasts. Of course. Josa kept his thoughts locked inside his own mind, to question a higher class was to be executed and he had no intention of following in his father's footsteps, or his mother's for that matter. At thirteen or so Josa was too young to work the heavy machinery in the textile mill, but in a few years he would be under the master's whip. Thankfully Josa's fascination with his markings kept his mind from that most of the time. Everyone in Ladenel had markings. Inky black stains that formed patterns and shapes. Josa always thought his were different but it seemed everyone thought the same about their own. Other people's markings were just squiggles to him, but his own had a pattern. The one on his hand was like lightning, his arms contained quick lines like the hurried strokes of a high class painter - seemingly making no concrete shape and yet having a pattern to them all the same. Here and there flame-like shapes licked his skin, perfect, dark circles the size of small fruits dominated other areas and something shaped like the sun sat on his forehead. A pale circle surrounded by lines shining out from it. He had spent countless nights sitting and staring at his marks by moonlight and still had no answers. Some of the high class scholars believed that they predicted the life events of the person. A few radicals thought they were events from a past life and setup whole libraries to catalog and study them hoping to work out who a person was in their previous life. Josa didn't believe either. It wasn't that he thought they were wrong just that he didn't think they were particularly right either. Perhaps the lightning meant he would be struck one day - killed even. The sun on his forehead could be the God under which he was born. The circles? He hadn't decided those yet, nor the lines and flames. Shouts shocked Josa back to the real world. A commotion was brewing outside the mill. Men's voices shouting at each other. Josa glanced around and didn't see the master so he made his way towards the sounds at the far end of the mill, near a wide sliding door. It was shut but it was also very thin. Through he he could hear the voices more clearly. It was a fight of some kind. Not that unusual, but then the faint clinking of chainmail and drawing of swords. Josa slid the doors open a slither and peeked out. What he saw terrified him. Three burly outcasts - marked by their ragged clothing and dirty skin - stood above a motionless guard. His vibrant cloak lying limp on the floor revealing his sparkling chain stained crimson. Two of the men held swords. One looked fine and ornate - the guard's most likely Josa thought - and the other was much more basic and less kept. The shouting had stopped and the three men regarded their equally numbered counterparts eagerly. The guards wore their own rich, red and blue cloaks. Square looking hats adorned their heads and golden buttons accentuated both cloak and hat. Beneath the finery however was a soldier's garb. Chain mail and leather. A large sheath and a smaller knife pouch - after all, the outcasts vastly outnumbered the guard. A flurry of activity began, slashing swords glinting golden sunlight, brilliant cloaks flapping with motion. A few cries, a scream, a thud and a clang of steel. Then the street was silent again. One man remained standing, four dead guards, two dead outcast and a lone, bloody figure standing above them all. Then the man dropped his fine sword and ran. Seconds later Josa heard the shouts and pounding feet of reinforcements drawn to the commotion but the man, the hero, was long gone. What man would dare do such a thing? Josa was part awed and part terrified. He longed to stand up to the high class himself. Not five years ago they had killed his parents by execution for no crime. They were merely outcasts and therefore deserved no life. But despite his brave desires he was too small, too weak and too scared to do what that hero had just done. The approaching guards checked the bodies for life and then began to search the area. One looked Josa's way and caught a glimpse before the boy dashed away. A moment later the doors were wrenched open by two of the guards. Josa ran. But a half starved boy had no chance outrunning well fed and trained soldiers. The mill was big, and had rows of fast moving, spinning machinery, dangerous machinery. The perfect place to hide. Josa sprinted down an aisle between machines. Surprised workers ducked away then cowed as they saw the guard approaching. Josa dashed left, rounding a huge loom and hoping it gave him the seconds he needed to dive under it's whirling mechanisms. He scrambled under spinning wheels and threading needles just as booted feet sprinted past. Josa breathed a sigh of relief and then panted heavily - the overwhelming sound above masking any noise he made. Then the world was yanked away. No, he was yanked away. Pain erupted in his shoulders are gloved hands gripped tightly. He was forced to his feet and held there. He tried to spin to see his attacker but caught only a glimpse of a guard uniform. A dozen paces away a scrawny worker stood, looking guilty. Josa spat at him as the guards dragged him away.

Absently he scratched at one on the backrest of his hand. It reminded him of lightning - it 's forked ear reaching from wrist towards knuckles. He stopped his observations however as the master passed by and instead kept wholesale. As an orphan and an pariah he had no rights and thought himself lucky that he at least had a few meals a week.

I assumed everything was fine and headed about my daily commute. It was a particularly sunny walk to the bus stop.

So strange, I thought, I haven't felt discomfort like this ever..... I started fumbling in my bag for a pair of sunglasses when a total stranger walked up and sat down next to me. As I pulled out the glasses he spoke calmly, \"Light sensitivity? Does your head hurt? Tension in your neck, maybe?\" Puzzled, I responded, \"Uh, yeah. My head hurts a little bit.\" \"Could be a migraine.\" He pulled out two small capsules and handed them to me, \"Take these.\" \"Thanks?\" I took the pills from him and put them in my pocket. \"That'll be 140.\" He demanded. He had a fierce look in his eyes. I stood up and quickly gave the pills back to him, \"Sorry, no thank you. I'm not paying you for anything.\" \"I said,\" He stepped closer to me, \"That'll be 140...\" I backed up but he kept moving closer. The bus was nowhere in sight. The further back I moved the faster he got and he kept demanding money. I turned and started to jog away slightly, feeling completely creeped out, but he stayed in tow. I ran faster and looked behind me but he was still chasing me. As I started to adjust my focus forward again I tripped. My pants tore at the knee where I fell and there was a deep scrape filled with bits of debris. I looked behind me and the man was closing in. My knee ached. Suddenly another man approached me and offered his hand to help me up. I took his hand and explained, \"Oh thank God, that man back there is chasing me, he's demanding my money!\" The second stranger looked down at my knee and pulled a handkerchief from his pocket. He lightly dabbed at the blood and spoke softly, \"That's quite an abrasion you've got there.\" I was confused, did he not care about the other man that was about to reach us, \"Sir, that man back there...\" \"Now, now, now, it'll be ok. We'll get this cleaned up. It'll be 90.\" He grasped my arm firmly. The first man caught up to us. \"I need that 140!\" the first man shouted.

I looked up and a very homey, comforting, motherly lady stood before me. \"NO!\" I wailed, sobbing, \"I was just trying to go to work and these men started hounding me for my money and then they were fighting over who was going to get my money and they chased me and I don't know what's going on and I don't feel safe!\" \"Oh, Sweety...\" she cooed in a soothing voice, \"Deep breaths now.

{"original_text": "President-Regent Langley was due to meet with Chinese President Ha Jin today at noon, in the White House Blue Room. Press and other observers from both sides of the Pacific crowded the Rose Garden and the lobby, jockeying for entry. What the President-Regent did today how he conducted himself would determine the course of the current hostilities. The two statesmen danced the usual Kabuki act of formality: handshakes, mutual bows, an invitation to have a seat, smiles for the cameras. Their discussion in the Blue Room was not ever meant to be substantive, but just look good for the PR machine. The real discussions were happening, and would continue to happen, behind closed doors, in embassies and conference rooms, and they would involve not just the two heads of state but whole retinues of career diplomats working tirelessly, around the clock, to avert nuclear war. \"It's an honor to have you here today,\" President-Regent Langley said to President Ha Jin, once the two men had settled themselves in the plush leather chairs that angled toward one another. \"It is an honor to be here,\" President Ha Jin said in fluent English hardly an accent. \"Well,\" President-Regent Langley said, \"let's see how you feel after you've had some of my wife's cooking.\" Laughter from the press corps, flashbulbs popping. President Ha Jin arched his eyebrows, playing confused. \"Interesting custom,\" he intoned. \"Should not Cynthia Hannigan be cooking tonight's meal? She is, after all, the true First Lady.\" President-Regent Langley pretended to flick some lint off the knee of he pleated trousers. He wished he could reach across the small square table separating him from President Ha Jin and throttle him unconscious. Instead he plastered a pained smile across his face and said: \"Cynthia has been through a lot these past few months, as you're well aware. She isn't making public appearances just yet.\" He patted President Ha Jin on the shoulder and satisfied himself with the fantasy that he was doing much more violence to the man. \"Besides,\" he continued, \"young John is a mama's boy through and through, but Cynthia is hardly the First Lady. She is the President Mother. And on that note he flashed a toothier, more winning smile to the contingent of reporters \"I look forward to the day, hopefully soon, that our young President can have a real First Lady living by his side at the White House.\" \"Mm,\" President Ha Jin grunted. \"Then let us dispense with these niceties. Shall we sign the treaty?\" State department officials came in through the side door, bearing a small podium and a scroll with the treaty's text written upon it in a regal faux script. The terms were already set and approved by both nations' congresses this signing, too, was a nicety of its own kind. In exchange for the Chinese withdrawing its missile silos from the irradiated ruins of Hokkaido and its armies from beleaguered Honshu, allowing the Japanese people a self-determining government; the US had agreed to surrender the Beijing Five to Chinese custody, release control of its Pacific protectorates, and link the two nations' dynasties by marriage. The two statesmen each took a fountain pen. President Ha Jin stood and stooped over the podium to sign his name in Mandarin. He stepped aside and President-Regent Langley took his place. But before Langley could sign, Ha Jin stopped him. \"I do not believe,\" President Ha Jin said, \"according to your fine nation's constitution, that the Vice President has the power to sign any bills or treaties into law.\" President-Regent Langley's false smile dropped from his face. He allowed himself to appear angered projecting strength with regards to his claim on the Presidency was paramount. \"Don't be silly, now,\" he said. \"I am the acting President. Our constitution is very clear on this. I may sign bills into law.\" \"Nonetheless, I would rather John Hannigan sign the treaty, assuming he is literate. And I would like to see him, anyway. I was quite fond of his father, you will recall and since the young boy is soon to marry my daughter, I want to make his acquaintance.\" President-Regent Langley stopped himself from grimacing. This was a power play, naked and unashamed. He could buck back, join into a pissing contest assert firmly the legitimacy of his signature on the treaty. He wanted to, if only for his personal sense of pride. But more paramount than his claim on the Oval Office was that this treaty be successful. He would allow the Chinese no grounds on which to later dispute its terms. \"Have it your way,\" he said, cordially. \"President Hannigan just recently learned to sign his name and I think he would be proud to show everyone how precocious he is.\" Langley turned and said to an aid: \"please, go fetch John.\" President Ha Jin grinned smugly, but Langley had his own way of saving face in front of the world's eyes: \"since we are involving the young President,\" he said, \"why don't you fetch Qingxiang? They'll be husband and wife soon enough they should meet, don't you agree?\" President Ha Jin's ruddy complexion went slightly paler. But with reporters excitedly snapping photos and filming, he had no justification for refusing this ostensibly friendly request. In Mandarin, he asked his own aide to go get Qingxiang. Some moments later, little John Hannigan III, 56th President of the United States and Outlaying Territories and Protectorates, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Head of State and Government, and Defender of Liberty, toddled into the room. He could hardly yet walk, but wore a dapper dark black fitted suit, a gray silk shirt with matching blue silk tie, pointed loafers and pressed trousers. He was, as the papers loved to say time and again, the spitting image of his recently late father. President-Regent Langley knelt, the joints in his knees crackling. \"John,\" he said, \"we need you to sign your name.\" \"Sign my name!\" he said. \"Sign my name!\" He hopped up and down a couple times. \"That's right, John. Can you do that for us?\" \"Uh-huh!\" John's personal aides offered to get a hassock for him to stand upon so he could reach the podium to sign, but President-Regent Langley waved them off. Instead, he held John under the armpits and hoisted him up to the proper height. The press loved it, American and Chinese alike. John chewed on his tongue, trying his darnedest to sign neatly, just like he had been taught, though the result was still a splotchy chicken scratch that scrawled across the page. Langley beamed proudly while he held the young President. President Ha Jin blanched. Only someone like Langley could turn public humiliation at the hands of the Chinese into such a PR coup. That was why he was regent, after all. Soon after the signing was completed, President-Regent Langley suggested that the two signatories should finalize the treaty with a handshake. He relished the image of President Ha Jin bending forward to shake the hand of a toddler. You wanted to do your diplomacy with a child you got it, he thought bitterly. President Ha Jin's aides returned to the Blue Room with Qingxiang Jin in tow. She was two years older than John, and tall even for her age, so that side-by-side she seemed to tower over him. Her face was pale, and almost gaunt, her long raven hair often concealing her eyes. \"Hi,\" John said to his fiancee, \"I'm President Hannigan!\" \"I am Qingxiang,\" the girl said, struggling with what pieces of English she knew. Without prompting, the young President waddled forward and wrapped his arms around the girl he would soon wed. The girl went stiff, not sure how to respond, but with all eyes upon her she decided it would be best to hug him back. The press could not resist letting forth a chorus of awws and other heartwarmed cooing. President-Regent Langley felt like vomiting. But then Langley felt something else stirring inside him, as he watched the tiny girl. She didn't know what to do she kept glancing back at her father, who would give her no guidance, not even a simple nod or a shake of the head. President-Regent Langley considered the grim life that lay ahead of this girl. Yes, John liked her now, in his youthful naivety. But he would be raised to despise her. And thenceforth she would be a virtual prisoner in this foreign country, cut off from her family and all possibility of friends. She would be excluded from all government functions and distrusted by the people of both nations. Perhaps once or twice, when the couple came of age, John would joylessly rut inside of her and thereby produce the heirs that were the chief project of this marriage. And beyond this, her life would have no meaning. \"Let's hang out,\" John said, pulling back from the hug. \"We can play blocks!\" \"Blocks...\" Qingxiang said. \"Or dinosaurs! Do you like dinosaurs too?\" Qingxiang, startled and baffled, once more cast a glance back at her father, and once more received no help. She looked back at the young President. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I also like dinosaurs.\" \"What's your favorite?\" \"Erm Triceratops, I think.\" \"I like that one too,\" John said, nodding sagely. \"But T-Rex is my favorite. I have both, though. We can play them together!\" \"Hmm, that sounds fun.\" Langley did not like this. Neither did Ha Jin. But it was happening in public, and who were they to deny the two young lovebirds a play date? That would be a public relations disaster. For the first time, neither man felt like they had a real grip on power after all.", "text_perturb": "President-Regent Langley was due to meet with chinese President Ha Jin today at noon , in the White House Blue Room. Press and other observers from both slope of the Pacific crowded the Rose Garden and the lobby , jockeying for entry. What the President-Regent did today how he bear himself would determine the course of the current hostilities.

{"original_text": "\"I don't like it, this things to hot to keep here\" Kyle jittered. \"It's been almost an hour, we got ta go an \"Calm down,\" assured Raul, starring at the TV. \"He's got till 1 to show. Do you know how much we get if we bail? Nothing. I prefer him showing up late and getting paid.\" Kyle hunched his shoulders together, making his already thin body smaller than seemed possible. I had to suppress a chuckle. If Kyle got any more wound up his head might pop off. Still, he had a point, being nervous. But it wasn't the client being late that had me nervous. Everything had gone according to plan. Better actually. We were all in and out like ghost: no witnesses, no complications, and no trace. It was a perfect heist. And perfect bothers me. I'm not one of those pretentious \"perfect doesn't exist\" types, but I've never been part of anything that's gone this well. My marriage wasn't perfect. Hell, I blew that one bad. Sure as hell a shitty father. My little girl won't even talk to me on the phone anymore. Now I can't even get a real job. But this job will fix that. After tonight, I get back on my feet. After tonight, I can afford three hots and a cot again. Maybe I'm just being paranoid. A lot depends on this job going well and I'm just stressing out. Could have sworn my hair was falling out again. Hasn't done that since the divorce. It's probably nothing. \"Goddamit Kyle would you stop fidgeting!\" Raul hissed \"It's making me all sorts of uncomfortable.\" \"Can't help it\" Kyle protested. A smile grew on his face until it reached his eyes. \"I can't stop thinking about what I'm gon na do with my cut.\" He let the silence linger for a moment, hoping it would allow his partners to arrive at the same euphoric realization. \"A quarter mill, each,\" adding emphasis on the last word. \"We don' got our money yet,\" Raul stated with thinly veiled irritation. Raul wouldn't have even bought Kyle with them if he could, but no one could break through firewalls as quick as Kyle. More importantly Kyle was even better at not leaving any digital fingerprints behind. When it came to doing tech quick and clean, Kyle was the best, as long as he didn't have a panic attack. But despite the odds, Kyle kept it together two-hundred and fifty grand had that effect on people. \"No need to shit on my parade Raul. Speaking of which.\" Kyle leapt to his fit with a graceless jolt as he headed off to the restroom. Rauled scowled at his back. \"Just make it quick.\" A period of silence lingered. Normally that would bother me, but Raul was a guy who you hang out with in silence and not feel the impulse to start small talk just to break the silence. It was comfortable, professional even. Which caused his breaking the silence to catch me by surprise. \"What are you gon na spend it on. You're cut I mean.\" I'm going to build the life of a man my daughter can be proud of. I shrugged, \"Probably move to nicer apartment to start with. Maybe start using my powers for good instead of evil.\" Raul smirked. He never laughed. \"Yeah, you'll start shitting rainbows and sunshine will come out you're ass.\" He studied his feet for a moment, then looked up at me. \"You were never really meant for this life,\" he stated. He wasn't being rude or condescending. Just stating a fact. I didn't fit in. I saw something more with my life. I always believe on a way out. Kyle didn't care for one, Raul didn't have a choice. He made too many bad decisions with the wrong people. He stopped believing on a way out a long time ago. Before I could respond, the bathroom door shot open, and Kyle marched out clutching his gut. \"You might not want to go in there. Smells like, well, shit.\" Kyle collapsed back into his chair, still clutching his gut. \"That did not feel good.\" Before Raul could say whatever obscene thought was on his mind, the radio on his belt yelled up at him. \"Yo, got that SUV pullin' in. I think that's our guy,\" said the cheery voice on the radio. \"Got it Ben. Stay up there and keep an eye out,\" Raul stated with obvious relief on his voice. I glanced down at my phone to see it was 12:59. Nope, 1:00 now. \"Got to hand it to this guy, hell of an entrance,\" I said with as much sarcasm I could muster. \"It'll be even better if he comes with the mill' he owes us,\" Raul reminded. The job wasn't over, and Raul didn't let any of us forget it. Ever. The black SUV pulled into the warehouse, obviously, this guy watched way to many movies. But if his money was good, I guess I could let it slide. Still, I guess I should give him some slack. He's giving me a second chance with Julie, even though he doesn't know it. It may not work out, but this man is giving me what I need to gain my daughters respect again. And maybe someday, her love. A man with wearing an jet black suit stepped out of the driver's door. with his all black attire, he would have blended in entirely with the darkness behind him if his shoes didn't shine with the little light that existed. \"You have my crate?\" he asked, monotonously. \"You got our money?\" Raul responded, completely disinterest with everything else. \"First I want to see the product, make sure it's still in the box.\" The coldness of his voice was matched only by the condescesion it carried with it. Raul and I shared an uncomfortable glance. \"You asked us to get the crate. It's still locked and sealed, you can see that easy enough,\" Raul explained, as though one professional to another. \"I don't give a damn what's in it, but I did a job, and now I get paid.\" Even though there was only thirty feet between the client and Raul, it seemed to grow farther than that. This has to go down right, it has to. A few moments existed before the client responded. \"Either you open the chest, and show me whats inside, or I walk away, and you get to keep your bounty.\" A thin smile formed on his face, \"But how long do you think it will take for the cops to track down government property?\" Glancing over at Raul, I immediately saw Raul calculating whether it was worth dumping someplace if we weren't paid. But we had to get paid. I had to get paid. \"Raul,\" I breathed. He snapped his head towards me. I showed weakness in a negotiation, and left us with little choice. He walked over to the wall and pick up a crowbar. I quickly rushed to get the lock open and was able to break through it with a pair of bolt cutters. Raul and Kyle walked over with the crowbars and started pulling up on the metal crate. I watched them eagerly, praying that what we found in the metal box was what our client was looking for. As the lid slowly started to lift, I started getting nauseous. Just nervousness, the next few seconds decided my future. \"It's about to give\" Kyle cheered. Over Kyle's shoulder, I saw a report of our heist, and it showed what we stole: experimental thorium. Despite the muted volume, I could see the reporters lips form a word, no, a sentence. Lethal. We were about to open a crate of radioactive material. WE'RE TRYING TO OPEN IT! \"Wait!\" I tried to warn, but my yell was drowned by the loud metallic pop of the lid breaking its seal. It was then that I felt it. Heat, worming through my flesh, holding every nerve entralled, unable to act on its own. I tried to warn my partners again, but instead of words, vomit came up. It came up again, and again, and again. It quickly changed from vomit to blood. Then to bits of flesh came up with the blood. I collapsed. Looking over at Raul and Kyle, I saw their faces blistered and burned. They got the full brunt of it, they got quick deaths. I envied them for a moment. \"Excellent,\" the client said with his typical monotonous voice. He was wearing a Hazmat suit now. When did he get that on? Why wasn't I paying attention to him? \"It's exactly what I wanted.\" I was breathing heavily, desperately trying to fill what was left of my lungs with air. Every attempt to yell or scream shot burning pain through my throat. \"The client looked over his shoulder. More men were walking towards him from the SUV. \"Wasn't there a fourth man, just outside about a block?\" Under the visor, I could make out the cruel grin of one of the men who had just appeared. \"He's taking a nap, I don't think he's gon na wake up though,\" the man with the cruel grin began to smile, as though impressed with his own wit. \"Good, then seal this up and let's get out of here.\" In those final moments, I watched as the men who killed Ben, Kyle, and Raul, reseal the crate. Despair gripped me as my now blind eyes tried to cry. My wife was right: I would die on the streets. But Raul was right too. It wasn't where I belonged.", "text_perturb": "`` I get along n't like it , this things to hot to keep here '' Kyle jittered. `` It 's been almost an hour , we got ta rifle an `` Calm down , '' assured Raul , starring at the TV. `` He 's got till 1 to show.

It 's stock still locked and sealed , you can see that easy enough , '' Raul explained , as though one professional to another. `` I do n't give a shucks what 's in it , but I did a job , and now I get paid. `` Even though there was only xxx feet between the client and Raul , it seemed to grow farther than that. This has to blend in down right , it has to. A few instant existed before the client responded. `` Either you open the chest , and evince me whats inside , or I walk away , and you get to keep your bounty. `` A thin smile formed on his face , `` But how long do you think it will take for the cops to track down government property ? '' Glancing over at Raul , I immediately saw Raul calculating whether it be worth dumping someplace if we were n't paid. But we accept to get paid. I had to incur paid. `` Raul , '' I breathed. He snapped his mind towards me. I showed weakness in a negotiation , and left us with little option. He walked over to the wall and pick up a pry. I quickly rushed to get the lock open and was able to break through it with a pair of bolt cutlery. Raul and Kyle walked over with the crowbars and set about pulling up on the metal crate. I watched them eagerly , praying that what we found in the metal box equal what our client equal looking for. As the lid slowly embark on to lift , I embark on getting nauseous. just now nervousness , the next few seconds decided my future. `` It 's about to give '' Kyle recreate. Over Kyle 's shoulder , I saw a report of our heist , and it register what we stole : experimental thorium. Despite the muted intensity , I could see the reporters lips form a word , no , a sentence. Lethal. We were near to open a crate of radioactive material. WE 'RE TRYING TO surface IT ! `` Wait ! '' I tried to warn , but my yell was drowned by the loud metallic pop of the lid breaking its seal. It constitute then that I felt it. Heat , squirm through my flesh , holding every nerve entralled , unable to act on its own. I tried to warn my spouse again , but instead of words , vomit came up. It make out up again , and again , and again. It apace changed from vomit to blood. Then to bits of flesh came up with the line of descent. I crumble. Looking over at Raul and Kyle , I saw their faces scald and burned. They got the entire brunt of it , they got quick deaths. I envy them for a moment. `` Excellent , '' the client said with his distinctive monotonous voice. He was wearing a hazmat suit now. When did he get that on ? Why was n't I compensate attention to him ? `` It 's exactly what I wanted. `` I was breathing heavily , desperately trying to fill what was go away of my lungs with air. Every attempt to yell or squall shot burning pain through my throat. `` The client looked over his articulatio humeri. More men were walking towards him from the suv. `` be n't there a fourth man , just outside about a block ? '' Under the visor , I could make out the cruel grin of one of the men who had just appeared. `` He 's taking a nap , I do n't think he 's gon na wake up though , '' the man with the cruel grin began to smile , as though impressed with his own brainpower. `` Good , then seal off this up and let 's get out of here. `` In those final minute , I watched as the men who killed Ben , Kyle , and Raul , reseal the crate. Despair gripped me as my like a shot blind eyes tried to cry. My wife was right : I would give up the ghost on the streets. But Raul was right to a fault. It represent n't where I belonged.

When he put the clock away he noticed the type-writer written paper under it. He took it out of the box and read it. \"When this clock hits zero, you will die.\" There was nothing else but that. He stared at the note, feeling blank for a moment. This always happened: No matter how many chain mails he received or comments he saw online saying'If you don't resend thisread this your familyyou will die', he always felt that small fear and dread.

Yes, even if you think ' that will never happen'it's not the sign that it will. Real life had no time for such nonsense. He looked at clock and again, seeing the time. 1458 hours.

Strangely, he never got around to doing it. Life got in his way, or rather the glorious world of the internet did. He had guns to shoot, stuff to watch, parties to attend and regret getting too drunk at. Business as usual. One month down the line he remembered the clock again and looked at the timer. It was definitely broken. It seemed to have gone down more than before. It claimed he had 321 hours remaining to live. \"Huh.\" He said as he took an entire sip of the vodka he had by his computer. He watched as the digital display suddenly paused, and then the number knocked itself down. Now 320. \"What's up with that?\" It was unsettling. On a whim, he took another shot, and just like well - clockwork - the timer decreased again. This time by a few minutes. It took him another week to figure out that the time decreased or increased according to his habits. They were miniscule changes mostly though, and he tried to ignore it all, put the clock in a corner somewhere. He still couldn't get himself to get rid of it though. Frustrated at the claim that he had only 72 hours to live, he tried to open it. And found it was impossible to: Literally. The thing had no screws to be unscrewed, and he knew that something was very wrong when in frustration, he tossed the clock on the floor and nothing happened. It made a loud crack as it went across, but when he picked it up it was completely unscarred. \"What the hell.\" He started jogging. He stopped smoking and drinking and tried to spend his time outside. There was a mixture of dread and relief as his time went up by 200 hours, but then it refused to budge after that. He gave up and spent his days wasted in his apartment, watching the cursed clock and thinking he'd gone mad somehow without noticing. As of May 31st, he was going to apparently die in 23 hours. He couldn't sleep or eat. Every time he convinced himself it was all a joke he took a hammer, a rock or anything to smash the clock and with his failure realized that something abnormal was going on here.

Try it.\" \"Unbreakable, huh.\" Trevor said, walking over to the window and tossing it out. \"What the hell man!\" He rushed to stop him, but was only in time to hear it smack the pavement. His apartment was on the third floor. \"Dude, you clearly need to get out more. \" Trevor said as he kicked an empty pizza box on the floor. \"Plus you stink. This whole room stinks. Get a shower and clean this place up before you make this whole building block a biohazard for godssake. Then, we're going out for some good old socialization.\" \"Dude \"20 minutes.\" Trevor said before taking a seat. So he took a shower. By the time he was done he felt like his head had broken water. It was all so silly, wasn't it? \"Wait. Tomorrow is April 1.\" He realized. The bastards. They had gotten him for sure. Hook line sinker and bait. This would be a great story to write about later. A definite legend to explain over drinks too. It had seriously messed him up. He laughed out loud. \"You ready?\" Trevor said when he was finally done with some rudimentary cleaning of the flat. It had been a pig sty at this point. He needed to sort that out. Maybe even get his life in order. If there was a silver lining to this whole nonsense, was that he could do a better job of taking care of himself. \"Let's go.\" He said. So they went out and had a great time. But the simple great time turned into a party, and he found himself out all night up until midnight. Business as usual. Trevor drove him back and supported him as he stumbled everywhere towards the apartment. He didn't even remember leaving the bar. \"You're the best man! The best!\" He slurred. \"I was seriously in the dumps man. That stupid clock screwed with me in more ways than one.\" Trevor didn't answer him. Was distracted by something. He was looking up at something in silence. \" Hey... \" That was when he smelt the smoke. He looked up and saw that the whole apartment block was on fire. Black smoke roiled out of the windows. There were screams, sirens. He'd been too drunk to even notice. \"I'm..... I'm gon na be...\" He stumbled away and got sick in a nearby gutter. He felt a little bit better. Adrenaline was kicking in to mediate the buzz. That was when he noticed the black shape sitting on the pavement. Looking at it, he recognized it for what it was. It was the clock. Damn thing was even sitting upright. The hours had gone up by a massive amount. He now had decades to live, apparently.

Get a exhibitioner and clean this place up before you make this whole building block a biohazard for godssake. so , we 're going out for some good old socialization. `` `` fellow `` 20 minutes. `` Trevor sound out before taking a seat. thusly he took a shower. By the time he was done he finger like his head had broken water. It was all so silly , was n't it ? `` time lag. Tomorrow is apr 1. `` He understand. The mother fucker. They give birth gotten him for sure. Hook line donut and bait. This would be a great story to publish about later. A definite fable to explain over drinks too. It had badly messed him up. He laughed out gaudy. `` You quick ? '' Trevor said when he was finally done with some rudimentary cleaning of the flat. It had been a pig pigsty at this point. He needed to assort that out. Maybe yet get his life in order. If there constitute a silver lining to this whole nonsense , constitute that he could do a better job of taking care of himself. `` Let 's drop dead. `` He pronounce. So they went out and had a great metre. But the bare great time turned into a party , and he found himself out all night up until midnight. clientele as usual. Trevor drove him back and supported him as he stumbled all over towards the apartment. He exercise n't even remember leaving the bar. `` You 're the best serviceman ! The best ! '' He slurred. `` I was in earnest in the dumps man. That stupid clock screwed with me in more room than one. `` Trevor did n't respond him. Was disorder by something. He was looking up at something in muteness. `` Hey. . . `` That embody when he smelt the smoke. He looked up and project that the whole apartment block was on fire. Black heater roiled out of the windows. There equal screams , sirens. He 'd been too inebriated to even notice. `` I 'm. . . . . I 'm gon na cost. . . `` He stumbled away and flummox sick in a nearby gutter. He felt a footling bit better. Adrenaline was complain in to mediate the buzz. That was when he noticed the black shape ride on the pavement. Looking at it , he recognized it for what it exist. It be the clock. Damn matter was even sitting upright. The hours had gone up by a massive measure. He now had decades to live , patently. One disaster alleviated , it was showing him the next time he was to give up the ghost. ``. . . . . Nope. `` He suppose. And with that , he slew the clock down the same gutter he had puked in , stood up and stumbled away from it. ", "label": 1}
{"original_text": "I live in a hotel room. It's not that I can't afford a house, I have plenty of money from various sources. I just prefer to stay in a small, tidy room without the distractions of supporting oneself. The hotel isn't too expensive or too cheap, it's better than paying rent in a lot of places. The manager doesn't seem to mind. I pay for my room and I don't cause any disturbances, so she lets me stay as long as I want. I'm too shy to stir up any trouble. I'm not the kind of hotel guest who drains the mini-fridge in a night and throws the television out the window. Not that I'm a paragon of goodwill, I just don't like getting in people's way. Every morning I eat breakfast in the hotel restaurant. I sit near the window in the corner so I can choose to look outside or at the reception desk. From my vantage point I can see everyone checking in and out. Families, singletons, philanderers, businessmen; everyone passes through here. This is my world and this is its population.
