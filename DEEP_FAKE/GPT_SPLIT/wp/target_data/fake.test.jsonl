Night shift was nice, the lights were dimmed aboard the ship, and the engines' steady hum was soothing. But as soon as Jim stepped into the engine room, he knew something was off. The humming was louder than usual, and there was a strange rattling sound coming from one of the turbines. Jim walked around the engine room checking every gauge and meter, but nothing seemed out of place. He started to think that maybe he was just being paranoid, but then the rattling sound grew louder. He traced the noise to one of the turbines, and when he opened it up, he found a damaged bearing. Jim knew he had to act fast. He shut off the turbine and radioed for the on-call engineer. He then spent the next few hours replacing the damaged bearing with a spare one, all while keeping a watchful eye on the other turbines. Thanks to Jim's quick thinking, the problem was resolved without any damage to the engines or the ship. The on-call engineer arrived just in time to help Jim finish the repairs, and together they restarted the engines. As Jim walked out of the engine room, exhausted but relieved, he realized that it wasn't just luck that he had drawn the short straw for night shift.
