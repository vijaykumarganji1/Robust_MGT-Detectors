Upon arriving he hopped up onto the creaky wooden porch and tossed his make shift umbrella aside. His nostrils filled with a smoldering smell and he looked down at the box. Small pocks covered its surface where the acid rain had hit. Better the box than him, he thought cheerfully. He brushed any remaining sizzling dew off his tattered leather jacket and proceeded inside. The tin can was empty save for four or five refugees huddling in a corner. They were playing a game of dice, the die being made from some poor sods knuckle bones of course. This was the apocalypse after all wouldn't want to mar that image with a fresh set of Bud James Dice. Incidentally, if Maslow's memory served those particular knuckle bones came from a fellow named Bud James. Ah, the universe was silly in that way. What was the saying? Life imitates art far more often than art imitates life, yes quite. Regardless Maslow wasn't visiting the tin can to game, he had other duties to attend to. At the far end of the rusting semi-cylinder meeting hall he saw his target. \"Sigmund!\" He called happily, \"Good to see you old friend.\" Sigmund turned at his call and waved. A bald man with a peppery beard, Sigmund looked half hard boiled egg half grizzled professor on his tenure. His green eyes speckled in the the jumpy light of the wall sconces. \"Well I'll be my mother.\" Sigmund said with a wide smile, \"Maslow old friend, how goes the apocalypse?\" Maslow shrugged, \"Can't complain. Ate an irradiated rat yesterday. Salted that rodentia up and I swear it tasted just like the number two from that double arched fast food franchise.\" \"Ah, now that brings back the memories.\" Sigmund replied pointing, \"Get over here friend, kick off your soleless shoes and drape that rag of a jacket on the mummified human over there.\" Maslow happily obliged and a moment later he found himself sitting across from his old friend sipping fermented corgi-fruit wine. Sigmund rocked steadily in his old rocker and between them lay a checkerboard littered with pieces fashioned from, yet again more metacarpals. How fortunate they were to be a species with so man finger bones! \"So what brings you Underhill Maz?\" Sigmund asked between sips of wine. \"To talk of course, it's been far too long since our last chat.\" Maslow replied. Sigmund's eyes rolled up as he recalled their previous conversation, \"Oh, yes!\" He exclaimed after a moment, \"We were discussing the efficacy and morality of cannibalizing famous actors and actresses.\" \"Correct.\" \"If I do recall we came to consensus on the matter. A-list stars, Cruise, Crews, and Cruz were to worn as pelts. B-listers often tasted the best because of their massive drug consumption like the hormone injected cattle of old.

Maslow cleared his throat. \"To discuss what I've been working on lately. A ladder of sorts of base human needs. A sort of pyramid of what all humans require. A \"A hierarchy perchance?\" Sigmund cut in. \"Don't be ridiculous friend.\" Maslow scolded. Sigmund chuckled. \"I only kid. By the way how's the wine?\" \"Delicious. They really brought out the dog flavors in this vintage.\" Maslow replied and took another sip of wine. \"Well let's discuss this pyramid-ladder of Maslow's human requirements then.\" Sigmund said with a toast. Maslow cleared his throat and began. \"The way I see it, and if the apocalypse has thought us anything, humans need three basic things; food, water, and shelter. Now I suggest that once these most base needs are met they will require more, we as a species fear stagnation so we must continue climbing, thus my ladder metaphor. Such is the curse of sapience.

Safety nets must be established\" \"I'm following.\" Sigmund said as he digested the information. \"Once safety is established humans ascend to tier three, lovebelonging.\" Sigmund looked into his wine with melancholy, \"Ah, don't we all wish for such things.\" \"And I propose that it is a natural need and must be sated before ascending any further. Slave masters can offer you the same love a concubine can, but I propose harems however are materialistic and do not satisfy this tier.\" \"Naturally, but what if monogamy?\" \"Old friend, the world wasn't cleansed in nuclear fire so we could revert backward. But since you mention and in the words of that deliciously tasting Kanye West,'love is cursed by monogamy.\" \"Excellent point. Do go on.\" Maslow continued, \"Tier four is esteem. The building of identity and the emotions that develops therein. This level is complicated because it grows only in the mind. Esteem can be fed by outside sources, but true growth comes from the sunlight within.\" Sigmund nodded and sang, \"This little light of mine, I'm going let it shine.\" \"Let it shine, all the time, baby you so fine.\" Maslow finished in his vibrato. The two shared a friendly chuckle. \"And what comes after.\" Sigmund said filling his compatriots glass from the skull of the corgi in which the wine was fermented. \"Self-Actualization.\" Maslow said with flourish. \"Spectacular I love it.\" Sigmund declared. \"You should publish it on the skin of your enemies!\" Maslow nodded that's what he wanted to hear. \"And I shall!

A long and dainty thing, Maslow bet she had wonderful finger bones. \"Coming mother!\" Sigmund called and he tossed back the last dregs of his wine. \"Well my friend I bid you adieux.

I put it into an Owl shaped mug and within a few swigs it was gone. I felt my eyes get tired again and laid on my bed. \"No dreams.\" I said to my brain of course it didn't listen. It had been only a few months since I was approached by a homeless man who wanted to give me a \"gift\" for buying him a hot meal. Some gift. I hadn't slept in days and when I did sleep the dreams came. Horrible visions of what could happen not would but could. I could see the future but there were two flaws to this.

I felt my heart sink and I dropped my bags. I wanted to be angry but the pure shock was still racing through me. He stepped out of the car and I barely recognized him.

Quite ironically the Exxon Valdez was notorious for crashing and spilling its cargo. `` `` Well , talk about making a bad gens for yourself. Now both ships will go down in story for spilling black gooey stuff where it does n't belong. Who had that bright idea for such a name anyway ? `` `` Well , Fred , the company made its first plunder by entertain a naming contest on the internet. `` `` Oh , will they ever learn ? `` `` patently not , Fred. predictably someone tried to make a joke out of it. A niche side of history role players got nothingness of the contest and made it its goal to get it named after the infamous Exxon Valdez. Apparently they thought it would be funny , and given the content both ships were ferrying more or less , they might have a point. `` `` Funny , indeed , wiener. What 's the name of the side ? `` `` fountainhead , Fred , it 's called Reddit. The people there mostly talk in outdated jargon and memes and watch cat pictures back from a time when the internet only was local on Earth. `` `` Truly a herald of the night ages. `` `` You might be right about that , Fred. I assume they just suppose it was funny. I guess this happens , when you let the net decide on things. `` `` Well , Frank , when you think about the content both ships were ferrying some , they might have been right. Embarrassing for the company , but queer for everyone else. `` `` It might get worse than that , Fred. Environmentalists are up in weapons system. They claim that the human waste products spilling out of the ship might collide with Jupiter 's moon Europa within the next few millennia and might contaminate the biosphere with Earth life. manifestly there are a lot of bacteria and the likes in poop and some might be able survive the harsh conditions of space and end up impacting on the restricted moon. `` `` Oh dear , Frank , does the monolith know about it yet ?

{"original_text": "\" What kind of coffin has a latch made for the inside? \" That was my only thought before I jumped in and used that latch to seal myself in, barely avoiding a dozen walkers right behind me. I had actually thanked the Lord when I found the coffin. When I determined it was of a kind of sturdy design and material fabrication which would hold against that initial onslaught coming through the mortuary behind me. I was in such a heightened state of terror, and there was nowhere safe. No matter where I went, it was never good enough. Then I'd found this last room, my last chance to hope for survival. And I'd assessed the coffin I found stored in it in half a second and realized it might be my only chance for survival. They were about 10-15 seconds behind me, I'd at least managed to gain a little ground on them. I flipped the lid open with gritted teeth, afraid there might already be a body inside. I felt so lucky to find it empty I could barely contemplate what I was actually about to do. Climb inside a coffin, a small, dark, tight space, and seal myself inside it, alive. I didn't have time. I just did it. I was thinking about those hellish claws and teeth, and how my guts were going to be pulled out and chewed through like Twizzlers while I was still alive to feel it. No way, man. No fucking way! But then the lid slammed down over me with a kind of mortal boom that was visceral, it hurt my head. I barely turned that suspect latch in time, that latch, the one on the inside. For God knows what reason! Did someone fear their loved one might come back from the dead? So they intended to seal them inside, preventing escape? Perhaps that's why the coffin was so well made, so sturdy, so fortified? I tried to think..... but there was all this dull-cow-eyed moaning in the air all around my coffin..... and the frenzy of bony fingers scraping and fist beating on the outside of the coffin where I'd just managed to escape them. And for a moment, I praised myself. I felt grateful that I'd managed to avoid certain death, avoid being eaten alive. I actually smiled for a moment. Can you believe that? In all the shit of this world, having managed to survive a moment later, what was the big deal? And yet, I was happy I'd outsmarted them. But that was three days ago. And they had not left. And there had never been a chance for me to escape, to jump out of this nightmare, and be done with it. I was going hungry, and then thirsty, and then hungrier still. And then my lips started to crack. And with every hunger pang, every cry of my body for a drip of water, I felt my mind going deeper into insanity. I was trapped. Trapped bad. This was a constant torture of the worst kind. Trapped, locked motionless, unable to stretch my muscles, feeling the cramps come and go in every part of my body, the sores on my ass, these strange pains in my side and back, the film coming and going over my eyes. The hunger was gnawing at my insides almost as bad as I'd imagined the walkers doing which had initially forced me into the coffin in the first place. The thirst was worst, I felt voices singing in my head behind my ears, and they sounded like water angels. Their was an ethereal quality to the hallucinations, they seemed to be torturing me, defying me, taunting me to leave the coffin. I tried it, briefly, a few times on day two, that's how I know it was day two. The first time I saw the room was dark, the only window (thankfully on the side where the lid opened) was dark and full of stars. I had only cracked the coffin a crack, ever so slowly. It was then I saw a dozen walkers still milling about in the room, almost having gone totally silent. As if to fool me into coming out. I was shaking as I contemplated how bad I wanted to get out of this coffin, whether it was worth it to try and escape in the dark. Maybe they wouldn't see me? Maybe I could..... NO! \"Don't be a fool! It can't work!\" I told myself internally at the last moment before I started to open the coffin and try my plan. It wasn't a sound, though, or any visual stimulus on my part that roused them, I think it was the smell of my flesh, the open sores, wafting out of the crack in the coffin lid, that betrayed me. They could smell me getting closer, and they all turned at once and ran toward me, clawing and growling with feral animosity. The lid was down and the latch turned as they yanked on it. I felt the door trying to burst open, but the latch held. I was shaking and on the verge of tears, so terrifying was this entrapment, so loud were their screams, so dark was this night in which I had only time to lie there, aching in every way, contemplating the vast ocean of my foolishness. It was now a battle between how long I could last in the coffin, and how long they could last in waiting for me to come out. I lie there all day the third day wishing some noise would distract them, draw them out, away from me, so I could get out. My legs were screaming, my arms were two snakes writhing in the dark, poised to gouge my own eyes out. I heard whispers in the coffin, like rats squealing, trying to get in and eat my eyes. I felt little teeth on my neck, or chewing on my hair. But when I put my hands on those spots, there was nothing there. There'd never been. But there was no stopping these hallucinations. Their only goal seemed to be to drive me mad enough to lift the coffin lid and make my escape. But I wasn't crazy enough yet to believe I could actually make it. Time would turn against me, turn me against myself. It only needed just a little more time, and I would surrender to the real, visceral destruction waiting for me rather than continue to submit to the false reality of my senses turning against me. The descent into madness was something I could literally feel myself falling into with every breath I took. Soon, those lungs began to turn against me too, becoming shallow. I couldn't get a full breath. I realized the coffin was made too well, it probably didn't have enough vents for air, and why should it? The occupant was already supposed to be dead. So I had to crack the lid more and more often. And each time, I could feel the noose (hypothetical noose) cinching down around me. Because one of these times, I was not going to be able to force myself to close that lid again. Because being trapped in a small space, confined, unable to move, was ticking on me like Chinese water torture. Tap tap tap! Was that real, or had I just imagined it again? Then it came again, louder. And I realized maybe it was a real person. The zombies were gone! I was okay! I was saved! Oh God. Yes, oh my God, thank you thank you..... I cried out \"Hello! Is someone there!?\" I heard back in a muffled voice as though the coffin was blocking the sound...... \"Is there someone inside the coffin? Are you still alive?\" \"Oh yes, yes, I am still alive. What happened to the walkers? There were almost a dozen of them out there, waiting for me to come out.\" Still muffled through the thick, nearly impenetrable coffin, I could barely make out the sound of \"No, they're gone now, you're safe to come out.\" Not able to believe my luck, I cracked the door to full day light. The walkers, at least through the small crack, were gone! It was true! I was saved! I can't believe my good fortune! I got the latch undone and threw open the coffin door. It was a miracle! Hahahaa! I crawled out. Amazed over and over again. When my foot stepped on the body of a sleeping walker, in a crowd of other sleeping walkers, my mind refused to believe it. I continued to push my weight forward, unable to comprehend what I was feeling. I looked around the room, the voices of the woman I'd heard were gone. No one was there at all. But beneath me, on the floor, the walkers all began to writhe around and stand up, returning to motion. They had fallen asleep in the confined room waiting for me to try and escape. But my foot had awakened them! The walkers! Holy shit! They're still here! What the hell!? NOOOO! But they weren't in any hurry to get me suddenly. They just moaned and waddled about, and seemed perplexed, as if I had escaped them somehow. I didn't want to question this good turn of events, so I ambled down the hall and prepared to make my escape. I was laughing on the inside. So freaking happy that my plan had worked, that I'd outsmarted them. It was in that moment of total amusement that I happened to catch my face in a mirror on the wall. The sight was horrifying beyond belief. I literally paused mid step to turn back and examine myself. I got closer and closer and could not believe it. This can't be real. I began begging for a way out from this nightmare. I brought my hands up to stroke my face, by bulging white eyes, and trace the blue lines under my gaunt white skin. I saw my hair had turned white and reminded me of (the information isn't there) that actor...... that on that show about (again, all gone)...... time..... about the future...... the doctor..... the..... no, my brain has soured, I can't THINK!! It was then the truth dawned on me. I had not survived my time in the coffin. At some point in the night, having fallen into a deep sleep, my body went over. I died. That's why the zombies had stopped waiting and had gone into this low-energy state. That's why they didn't care when I came out of the coffin. That's why they didn't give chase. I was a fucking zombie! \"NOOOOOO!\" I tried to say, but all that came out was a ghastly wail, just like one of those horrid monsters. The sound of it drew the other zombies out in a flash frenzy, suddenly the room was full of them, wailing and milling about all around me, avoiding me, I was invisible to them. Just then, as one, we all turned to face a shadow in the hall. A human had wandered in.

I looked at the small diagnostic screen \"Hydraulics severs in the radii and phalanx.\" \"Oh giddy.\" I grimaced, flicking at the broken wing of the ICARUS. \"Welp. Guess I'll miss my dinner date in Libra. Tsk.\" I stood up, my joints popping and cracking, I needed something to bind the tears in the hydraulics. I looked around. The vines and brush had absorbed the ruins of the old world. The afternoon sun was cool in the forest air. Maybe a vine would work, I snatched some and produced my pocket knife. I cut the lengths I needed and hollowed them out. I slid them over the severs, \"Well, they fit well enough. Let's see if it works.\" I tapped the button and the wings began to flap, but the vines were not strong enough and a jet of blue spurted from the pack. \"Bummer.\" I sighed, back to the drawing board. \"Hmmmmm, maybe there is something in one of these buildings.\" I walked into one of the ruins, it was dark and filled with cobwebs.

{"original_text": "I only really downloaded the TOR browser for a goof. I heard you could buy pot on a site called silk road. I hadn't really smoked since college- but a lot of states had been legalising recently, so I was thinking about trying it out again. I didn't think I'd buy anything- but once I got on the site I knew I had to try some. You have to understand, I was a heavy user back in the day- but the weed on there..... it didn't even look like the same plant. Big thick buds; actually green instead of that tawny brown shit. I mean, christ some of it was purple! So, I thought'hell, I'm nearing my golden years. I've got a nest egg, I'm not long off retirement- my kids have kids. I'm not in a place to hang around campuses looking to buy- this seems safe'. I ordereda quad of something called'Purple Haze'. What can I say? If it was good enough for Jimi. A couple of days later I got a knock at my door. On the step was a..... well. I hesitate to say man. When I opened the door, other than an overpowering stench of ganja I was struck by the figure's height. It was so tall, I craned my neck to get a look at it's face- but I was only met with a huge cloud of smoke billowing out from underneath a wizards hat. It wore a shabby grey suit that was several sizes too big around the mid section while barely covering it's forearms and shins. -Mr bigblackdragondildo? It's voice was like nothing I'd ever heard. I've hear people call the Irish accent melodic- but it almost sung each syllable. I was so taken a back by how beautiful it's voice was- it took me a moment to register that it had addressed me by my screen name. -Uh..... yes..... I suppose that's me. -I have traveled a long way on the silk road. May I come in? -Of course. It stood on it's tip toes as if it was a ballerina and without any other leg movement floated into my home. It had to duck to not slam his head on the door frame, and once inside it bent at the knees and slouched to fit. The creature turned to face me, and emitted a high giggling sound at my slack-jawed expression. It was so loud, I became very concious of my neighbours and very concious of the smell. I hadn't even told my wife I had ordered drugs. A panic set in and then an anger at this..... this thing's casualness. Before I could speak up it said- -Shall we go somewhere more private? -Yes. I have a garage. I led the way. -Don't worry about the neighbours. When they look my way, all they'll see is a slight shimmer in the air- and all they'll smell is a hint of rosemary and thyme.

It 's articulation was like nothing I 'd ever heard. I 've hear people call the Irish accent melodic- but it nearly sung each syllable. I was so taken a rearward by how beautiful it 's voice was- it took me a moment to register that it had addressed me by my screen name. -Uh. . . . . yes. . . . . I suppose that 's me. -I have traveled a long way on the silk route. May I come in ? -Of line. It stood on it 's tip toes as if it was a ballerina and without any other leg drive floated into my home. It had to duck to not slam his nous on the door frame , and once inside it bent at the knees and slouched to fit. The creature turned to front me , and emitted a high giggling sound at my slack-jawed expression. It was so loud , I became real concious of my neighbours and real concious of the smell. I feature n't even told my wife I feature ordered drugs. A panic set in and then an ira at this. . . . . this affair 's casualness. Before I could verbalise up it said- -Shall we go somewhere more private ? -Yes. I have a service department. I led the way of life. -Do n't occupy about the neighbours.

{"original_text": "I didn't know this is where I would end up. I didn't ask for this. It all started with one stupid mistake that got me here. About a year ago, I was out with some friends at a bar. We didn't have a designated driver. I was the one that was supposed to drive us, but we all agreed that I would just go a bit easy, then take us home. We were a group of college frat boys, of course there wasn't going to be \"going a bit easy\" for me around alcohol. So we drank and drank, shots of this and glasses of that, until we were so drunk we couldn't even think anymore. Somehow we managed to agree that it was time for me to drive us back to our dorm. What happened next never occurred to any of us. It was quick. Blackness and no noise, then waking up and finding blood everywhere. That's all I remember. I was told to step out of the car by someone I didn't recognize and take a Breathalyzer. When he saw the result he muttered \"Good god...\" to himself. I finally figured out what was going on. Then he told me. I was arrested on the spot and put into jail for a few days. I was sentenced to 16 months in jail for manslaughter. I had managed to kill a mother and her 3 kids on the side of the road walking home from a store. All dead. Because of me. Though I didn't remember anything I did, or really anything that happened that night, I still felt the worse anyone could feel. I had taken the lives of 4 innocent people just because I wanted to get fucked up. When I was in prison, I killed myself by hanging myself with my bed sheets. I couldn't take the guilt anymore. I never believed in an afterlife, but yet here I am. For my terrible actions, I have landed myself in the lake of fire. Hell. When I arrived I was booked in, they took my name and told me why I was here and what my eternal pain was going to be like. After I was told all that, I was just ready to leave the damn place. After all, who would take being in hell lightly? Before I left, I was told: \"Wait. You're not allowed to leave yet. We have to show you something. Follow me.\" I followed this being out of one room, through a hallway, and into another room which had double doors. Before I could even ask what this was, the being said \"Firstly, you must watch every moment that led you here for an hour. You are not to leave until it is done and you have watched everything and reflected on your actions. You are to do this on a regular basis. When you're ready, please enter those doors.\" I knew what was coming. I stood around pacing for a few minutes and just decided \"Fuck it\" and went it. I pushed the doors open and sat right at the front of the theater. The reel was loaded onto a projector and I saw the picture flicker on. People don't realize that yes, every little thing is considered. I saw myself when I was just 9 years old stealing comic books and candy from the store that I lived just down the street from. This won't get most people sent to hell alone, but it still counted I suppose. It went on to some kids I bullied in school and the times I lied to my parents about where I was. \"Sheesh\" I thought. \"They're really on my ass about everything.\" But I was just trying to lighten up the situation since I had knew it was coming. Soon enough, there it was. I saw an outside shot of the house I was drinking at that night. I saw a couple of idiots (me included) stumble out and into my car. I of course was in the passenger's seat. It cut to an inside view of my car. My friends and I were hollering and hooting about how much fun we had that night, and for the many more good times to come. Then, there was another shot of the outside of my car. Swerving and almsot hitting other cars. It cut to black, then there was a mother and her 3 young children, grocery bags in hand, walking down the street. \"I can't wait to go home and SLEEP mama!\" said one of the children. \"Well, we'll be home soon, darling\" said the mother, as they all walked on having short conversations. Then suddenly there were ferocious lights around the corner and noises of danger. Idiots were yelling and tires were screeching. Before I even knew it, my car had slammed into the mother and her children. I figured it was over by then as it had cut to black, but moments later another pictured flickered on. One of her kids was still alive. And she was still alive for a long time. She cried out noises of pain and misery, begging for her mom to respond and take the pain away or make everything better. She yelled out how much her arm hurt, or that she couldn't move her legs and was bleeding everywhere. She shrieked and wailed for about 4-5 minutes, then seemed to had passed out from the blood loss. The shot stayed by her limp corpse, and I could see myself taking the breathalyzer in the background. The reel ended here and I had sat there for ten minutes, trying to gather myself, but just crying. I hated myself. I knew the amount of pain and torture that was sure to come to me in physical form, but this mental form was already enough. What I did already had eaten at me to the point of suicide. But seeing the actual effect, had more dire mental consequences that can not be escaped by any means.

{"original_text": "My brother was a man who put the'try' in'cross-country.' Not all that smart, fairly mediocre. But dearly loved. Why else would we all be here to remember him this summer morning? Leo Fuentez was born in a small county hospital of Marion County, Oregon, on a cloud-filled September evening in 1989. Father had to drag me to see him that day. I was pretty close to beating Link's Awakening, but was interrupted by the birth of my little brother. Sullen, my first words to him were, \"not worth the trip.\" It took a couple days before Father's words the next morning struck me. I cried. Two hours old and Leo taught me how to be better for others. That's the kind of man he would grow up to be. One time the school bus did not bring Leo home at 3:52pm. He was 10 years old. An hour later, Mother called the police. Another hour later, someone knocked on our door. There was a police officer with my brother grinning like an idiot. Upset, she asked him what happened. The officer informed us Leo heard some kid pulling on a girl's hair, so he stood from his seat and turned, telling him to knock it off. Angry that some brat was standing while he was driving, the bus driver purposefully dropped him off in the wrong neighborhood. When asking Leo what he was smiling for, he told us he found \"a doughnut shop we hadn't been to before and couldn't wait to tell us about it.\" His grades were lousy. His soul made up for it.

Hateful light, gleaming off the eyes of the monster before her, locked on her own...... Unable to look away, Bitsy's skin began to pinch, ruffle, a hideous sort of mold growing along her arms..... her stomach......

She felt her entire body begin to firm, toe to top expanding under it's gaze..... each orifice of her body sealing, much to her utter terror...... Nose flattening against her cheeks, stitches winding through her lips, forcing a terrifying, uniform smile...... She could not believe this was happening to her, already..... The last to go were her eyes......

The war had ended when the Sword of the Sun had died defending the Sun King, and the Princess had sacrificed herself and her royal name. She paid for her life with her hand in marriage.

Although the peasants were unnerved by the king's attendance at his daughter's wedding, the free bread and ale quickly overcame their reluctance. It was a bit plain, but they had been hungry for a very long time. The wars didn't end, of course. Everyone knew that necromancers were inherently evil.

There were so many dead, in fact, that the king sent the extra skeletons to work the fields, to build roads, or perform other menial tasks. Crime also decreased.

{"original_text": "Johan Cicero was a scion of house Gottrop, born after the fall of France, and when even Grand Castile was fading before the imperial green. He was a sad youth, isolated from below by his imperial birth and from above by his demanding and unsympathetic father. Only one light ever entered his life. When he was seventeen or so, nearly of age, he accompanied his father on a state visit to the last free state of any significance in Europe, the old kingdom of Sweden, where he met the young Queen Katarina. Foisted onto the throne at a young age by the untimely death of her father, the Queen of Swedes was acutely aware of the responsibility placed upon her, and acutely aware that she was neither qualified nor prepared. The old emperor had hoped to cow her with his visit, but failed. In the Queen, young Cicero found a kindred spirit at last, and seized upon it as a drowning man seizes upon a rescuer. The Queen, however, did no such thing. The Empire was to her the ultimate evil, the cancer which had consumed the world, the death lurking ahead for free Sweden, which no force left on the earth could dare oppose. Even before the death of her father she had come to terms with these facts, and resolved that Sweden would die unbowed and unflinching. Cicero was to her merely an emissary of that onrushing doom, and she allowed him no compromise of the death-mask of proud defiance she had forged. Cicero was overwrought. He petitioned his father for a guarantee of Swedish freedom, and was met with incredulous distain. Abandoning all cares for anything else in the world, he played every card in his possession against his father, and revealed the truth of the situation. He was sent back to Bordeaux, and confined to imperial estates for the rest of his father's life. Katarina would not yield to the Emperor, so the Emperor made plain his final threat. The old king had died on his orders, placing a defenseless girl on the throne, and such a girl should value her own safety enough to bend to the inevitable. The Queen refused. The Emperor attempted to make good on his threat, but as the Swedes learned what their Queen had done, her legend grew and the difficulties facing agents of the Diet increased. When all recourse in that line at last failed, the Emperor came with his armies and overran Finland. The Swedes fought to the last, but conceded when the last free armies were destroyed. Rump Sweden lived on, as the Emperor was called south to dying Castile. In a pair of short years, the old Gottrop died himself. The Emperor Johan Cicero, called out from his internal exile, made haste to Sweden and threw himself at the feet of the Queen Katarina. He begged her for marriage, promising her that their line would rule Sweden and the Empire equally for all eternity. He promised her everything, even offering to abandon the Gottrop name, delivering any children to her dynasty. The Queen Katarina saw only another Emperor, here to see Sweden consumed. Even should his promises prove true, she thought, for how many generations would a Grand King of all Europe truly remember Sweden as anything other than a minor province? The Queen grieved for the Swedish dead in Finland, she grieved for her father, and she grieved for the freedom of her homeland. And so she shunned Cicero, and despised him, and would accept nothing from him short of the breaking of the Empire. And Cicero begged, and pleaded, and groveled until his own advisors felt compelled to look away, for there was something in him of the blood of his fathers, and of the dozen generations who had bled in France and England and Lost Castile to bring peace to Europe, and even in the grief and blindness of his love he could not bear to break the Empire. And so Katarina shunned him, and walked away from him on his knees. The Emperor Johan Cicero returned from Stockholm a changed man. A darkness hung over him for three days in Prague, and then the commands began. The armies of the Empire were marshalled to complete the conquest of their continent. When the thousand ships of all the Empire's ports passed the Oresund, the Swedes called forth the last of their ships, and lost them. When the Czechs landed in Skane, and the Lombardians landed in Vastergotland, and the Prussians came overland from lost Finland, the Swedes called forth the last of their generals and armies, and lost them. And when the Imperial Guard itself broke the gates of Stockholm and marched into the palace of the Nordic kings, and the Emperor Johan Cicero emerged from their ranks as the city burned all around, he did not find the Queen Katarina on the throne. The Guard did not find her when it searched the palace, nor after it sealed the city and searched room by room. Nor did the Prussians find her in Norrland, nor the Czechs in Skane, nor was she ever again heard of in Sweden or any of the lands of the Empire, so that the Emperor Johan was forced to leave unsatisfied, and to live out his life alone in Prague and Bordeaux and Barcelona. There are some who say that the Queen was smuggled out of the palace even as the city fell, and hidden away among common folk. There are some who say that a certain common maid on a certain street in Stockholm bears an uncanny resemblance to her. There are some who say that the love her people felt for her was so powerful that no reward could ever prevent that maid from being allowed to disappear when the imperial guardsmen arrived to investigate the rumors. There are some who say that the last Queen of Sweden spent her life among her people, as a living reminder of the days when their land was free. There are some who say that occasionally the Queen Kristina could be spotted in the streets of Stockholm when a friend or correspondent of the Emperor was near. The Emperor, for his part, left a month after the fall and never set foot in Sweden again. - The important thing to understand about this story is that it's all true. The events unfolded as described above in a game called Europa Universalis 3. Johan Cicero Gotrrop lived to a very old age, and oversaw the near conquest of the remnant of Castile, though he was unable to finish the job. Under his reign the true enemy of the Empire finally shifted to become Muscovy, which had expanded to all the proportions of the true Russian Empire and could field an army larger than that of the reformed Holy Roman Empire, of which Johan was the Emperor. That Empire had reformed from a Bohemia which had asserted its dominance over the empire under two Emperor-Kings of the Bathory dynasty, Stephen and Friedrich. The unified empire had immediately fallen into unending wars with France, ended only by the total grinding conquest of said country.

{"original_text": "Lucifer rubbed his temple as he sat in his favorite throne of bones and flesh. The idea of having a son was always such an interesting prospect for him, creating a successor for when he'd decide to give up the role of the great deceiver. Upon spawning his child, he decided to name them Mephisto, after one of the many human interpretations of himself. For so long the little hell spawn was the model son. He watched with a childish glee as his old man subjugated the sinners of Hell. Lucifer remembered with a spiteful fondness when Mephisto made his first mortal beg for forgiveness, they were awfully good memories. Now things were different. Mephisto would flat refuse to help in the torment, preferring more to work on his art. At first, this prospect intrigued Lucifer. The idea of using a visual medium to torment humans on a psychological could reap countless advancements in the field of subjugation. Alas, Lucifer was horrified to see one of his son's paintings be a landscape of rolling Earth countrysides. And that was just the beginning of this phase, Mephisto would find new ways to express these feelings, each new method driving more and more disappointment into the heart of Lucifer. Just recollecting the time Mephisto attempted to show him the marvels of the musical stylings of a Sarah Mclachlan on his guitar made him cringe. All of this disrespect came to a head when Lucifer returned to his chambers, to see the walls plastered in a sickeningly bright paint. His brooding greys, his visceral reds, all smothered by the vileness that was canary yellow.

It was better this way, at least it was for me. I didn't have to see my family suffer over my suffering. I was always more of a suffer in silence type of girl anyway. \"Hello Carmen.\" A voice came from the doorway. An man, young and well built, wearing white scrubs was shutting the sliding glass door of my room behind him. \"How are you feeling today?\" \"A bit better I suppose.\" I told him, the pain in my head was finally starting to subside. He smiled at me, a soft smile that made me feel safer than I had in the last two weeks. \"Are you one of the nurses?\" \"I'm here to go with you.\" \"Are they finally moving me from the ICU?

And also mine. Not like I die if I kill someone, but I'd die. Everything I am. Everything I stand for. Will die if I use this power. So no, I don't plan on using it. I plan on staying locked in my house forever to lower the chances of me slipping up and ending a life. I turned twenty-seven today..... it's been an eternity for me. Sorry.

{"original_text": "Like clockwork, I woke up at 2:43 AM, screaming. Sweat dripped from my hairline, leaving faint ghosts of sensation on my head, little droplets of sweat plopping quietly on the blanket. My breathing was heavy, fast, and I caught myself staring at my doorway. I took a deep breath, and started counting backwards from ten. When it didn't help, I repeated the sequence, taking exaggeratedly slow breathes as I counted. The second time helped, and I released the muscle-deep tension that had gathered at my shoulders and neck, laying back down. The room was bathed in the blues and purples that accompany early morning, and I let my eyes unfocus while I got my breathing back to a normal level. The hardwood outside my room creaked as it settled. I could hear the rain outside, playing the rhythms of life against the windowpanes. I awoke with a start, sat up, eyes narrowed suspiciously at my door. I stayed this way for a few seconds, trying to get my mind to catch up with whatever my instincts had picked up on. The room, and my house, was silent of anything other than the faint sounds of drizzle. With a small amount of intentional effort, I turned my eyes from the door and slipped on a shirt. After another second's hesitation, I paced slowly through the door and looked through my second story window. The morning was just coming into sufficient light, only slightly muted by a small patch of light gray clouds. The rain had lowered significantly, bathing the distant horizon in fog. In my backyard, one of the neighborhood cats was curled up under the glass table I had used for barbecues years ago. It slept soundly, and I smiled briefly at it before turning around. I started down the stairs, and froze suddenly. My instincts were raking at my senses, and I crept carefully back upstairs. In the corner of my bedroom, a small series of leather straps hung from a peg nearby my nightstand. I wrapped it around my shirt, shifting once or twice to help it settle in place, and unlocked the second drawer in my dresser. Inside was a small pistol, five loaded magazines, and few spare batteries of various sizes. I picked up the pistol, checked the chamber and safety reflexively, and slid one of the mags into place. I chambered a round, slipped the pistol into my hostler, put two mags opposite the pistol on the straps, and turned back to stairwell. I turned just in time to see a shadow disappear down the stairs. I unholstered the weapon, flipped the safety off, and raised the weapon forward. My finger hovered just outside of the trigger guard. I took an experimental step forward, crouched, keeping my center low and my footsteps quiet. As I paced very carefully to the top of the stairs, I kept the weapon high, my right eye more or less along the sights. I crested the stairs, muzzle pointed down, finger over the trigger. I barked \"Freeze!\" as loud as I could, sudden and sharp. The shadow twitched, and craned its head at me, curiously. I exhaled, carefully pulled my finger from the trigger, and pressed the decocker lever and safeties before holstering the gun. My dog, a sweet little Collie named Megan, wagged cheerfully at me from the foot of the stairs. I took another two shuddering breathes, and shook my head at the dog. \"Jesus, Meg, I could've shot you.\" She panted hopefully, sauntering up the stairs now that I'd visibly relaxed a little. I ruffled her fur, and stood up. My second trip down the stairs was significantly less nerve-wracking. The dog skipped along with me, bouncing carelessly across the hardwood with the little click of paws on hardwood. My little kitchenette wasn't terribly large, but it was reasonably well-stocked, and I fished around my fridge until I saw something that spoke to me. I started on the turkey first, cooking it fairly thoroughly before setting it aside and starting on the eggs. After I'd prepared the omelet, and given Meg her treat for keeping me company without whining for food, I sat down to eat. I'd run out of coffee two days ago, but orange juice was better for me, so I only complained a lot to no one in particular while I ate. The talking, even one-sided, helped quiet the sense of panic rising from the back of my mind. Afterwards, I tried to ignore the increasing sense of dread I'd felt while I was doing the dishes I'd messied. Outside, the day was transitioning from drizzle and clouds to full light, bathing the afternoon in bright sunlight. Flashes of orange gold fur passed as the neighborhood cat had woken and climbed atop my backyard grill to stand beside my kitchenette window and meow at me. I smiled at him, checked behind him just in case, and loaded the dishwasher. The clock on my oven blinked 11:43, and I steeled my nerves. I hazarded a quick glance through the peephole in my door, checking the angles before deciding to step foot outside. It was a lovely day, just on the far end of spring, before the true heat of summer would set in. It still rained fairly often, but every day without clouds was the sort of picturesque utopia that begged families to have picnics and days at the beach. I smiled up at the bright sunlight for a brief moment of happiness, collected my mail, and started toward my home. It wasn't until I was halfway to my door that my nerves bested me and I took the last ten or twelve steps at a run, spinning, and slamming the door closed. The blinds of a nearby window clattered loudly as the wall shook with the sudden slamming of the door. I leaned against the door, sinking, and tried to reign the nerves in. The hardwood was cool against my pants, my head spun as it reeled with a sense of non-specific dread. I shook my head, feeling my shaggy hair shift and settle on my head. I repeated this a few times, simply to have the routine of it be something else I could focus on. My fingers danced absently on the floor for a moment, and I got unsteadily to my feet. My left knee hurt, and I winced. Probably overexerted myself again. I gingerly recovered the mail I'd scattered all over the entryway, and brought it to the little office opposite the stairwell. Spam, spam, credit card application, spam, bank statement, hospital bill, and another four notices. \"Christ, seriously?\" I set the spam aside, and opened the hospital bill. I'd been making some headway on my debt, but it seemed like even just a year in a hospital bed had done more to cripple me than the beating that'd put me there. I found my checkbook, wrote off the amount of this month's bill payment, signed it, and filled out the envelope. I frowned at my stamp roll, noticing I was running low again. I collected a stamp, placed it on the envelope, and dropped it into the overflowing outbox on the edge of my desk. That settled, I shredded the credit card application, tossed the spam, and opened the four notices, reading them individually. The language was hauntingly familiar, explaining briefly what the notice was for, and what was going to happen. The form letter was almost always the same, only really explaining what the system was, and how it worked. The second page was the most important of the two, containing a little information on the person who'd filed to murder me. This batch was two young women named Elizabeth and Meaghann, a young man named Christopher, and the name of a television character. I frowned, and read over the last murderer again. From what I could tell, he'd had his name legally changed to that of a television show character, but was otherwise completely legitimate. Odd. I got up, making pained noises as my left knee complained, and pinned them to my rear wall. The entire wall was plastered in notices. I hadn't bothered keeping count anymore, but it couldn't have been less than two hundred notices across the various bulletin boards. Each and every one a promise of someone who wanted me dead. I looked at the four new pages, swinging gently as they settled into their pegs, and blended seamlessly into the sea of paper. Then I sat down, stared at the wall briefly, and cried. Emotions washed out in waves, ugly and calloused and hateful and wrong. There was something fundamentally wrong with such a world where this kind of thing was okay, and the ugly truth of that stared back at me. I stayed that way for a long time, until shaking and crying and feeling miserable. When I finally sat up, stiff and pained from staying in one position for so long, evening light was waxing outside. I went back upstairs, showered, and dressed down for the night again. The last bit of twilight was fading away, and I found myself in bed early. My thoughts drifted to my year in the hospital. It was my second year marked for death, and I'd already received tens of death notices. Without warning, one day while eating with my niece and her mother, I'd been attacked. Two men stood over me, pulled me to the ground, and beat me savagely. I remember little more than twisting, crying for help, and being hit. They kicked and punched, struggling to genuinely kill me as much as I struggled to get free. I wasn't sure if it was my screaming, or my niece's, but someone came and pulled the men off me. While in the hospital, I learned why I had been receiving so many murder notices. A political activist group had chosen their method of protesting the murder law by all signing up, and naming me. Even if almost all of the murder notices were from passive protestors, it was also likely that even just a few had the genuine intention to kill me. That hospital stay proved that. It was the last time I'd ever slept well. This sick, disgusting, miserable law had ruined my life. I never should have made it..... Like clockwork, I woke up at 2:51 AM, screaming.", "text_perturb": "Like clockwork , I woke up at 2:43 AM , call. Sweat dripped from my hairline , leaving swooning ghosts of sensation on my head , little droplets of sweat plopping quietly on the blanket. My breathing was labored , fast , and I caught myself staring at my doorway. I took a thick breath , and started counting backwards from ten. When it practice n't help , I repeated the sequence , taking exaggeratedly slow breathes as I counted. The second time helped , and I released the muscle-deep tension that had foregather at my shoulders and neck , laying back down. The room was bathed in the blues and purples that go with early morning , and I let my eyes unfocus while I got my breathing back to a normal level. The hardwood outside my room creaked as it patch up. I could hear the rain outside , meet the rhythms of life against the windowpanes. I awoke with a start , sat up , optic narrowed suspiciously at my door. I stayed this way for a few secondment , trying to get my mind to catch up with whatever my instincts had picked up on. The room , and my theater , was silent of anything other than the faint sounds of drizzle. With a small amount of intentional effort , I turned my oculus from the door and slipped on a shirt. After another second 's hesitation , I paced easy through the door and looked through my second story window. The morning was just number into sufficient light , only slightly muted by a small patch of light gray clouds. The rain sustain lowered significantly , bathing the distant horizon in fog. In my backyard , one of the neighborhood caterpillar was curled up under the glass table I had used for barbecues years ago. It slept soundly , and I smile briefly at it before turning around. I started down the stair , and froze suddenly. My instincts were raking at my senses , and I crept cautiously back upstairs. In the corner of my bedroom , a small serial of leather straps hung from a peg nearby my nightstand. I wrapped it around my shirt , shifting once or twice to help it patch up in place , and unlocked the second drawer in my dresser. Inside comprise a small pistol , five loaded magazines , and few spare batteries of various sizes. I picked up the pistol , checked the sleeping accommodation and safety reflexively , and slid one of the mags into place. I chambered a round , slipped the pistol into my hostler , cast two mags opposite the pistol on the straps , and turned back to stairwell. I turned just in time to realise a shadow disappear down the stairs. I unholstered the weapon system , flipped the safety off , and raised the weapon system forward. My fingerbreadth hovered just outside of the trigger guard. I took an experimental step forward , crouched , keeping my center low and my step quiet. As I paced very carefully to the upside of the stairs , I kept the weapon high , my right eye more or less along the sights. I crested the stair , muzzle pointed down , finger over the trigger. I barked `` freezing ! '' as loud as I could , sudden and sharp. The shadow twitched , and crane its head at me , curiously. I exhaled , carefully pulled my fingers breadth from the trigger , and pressed the decocker lever and safeties before holstering the gun. My dog , a sweet piddling Collie named Megan , wagged cheerfully at me from the foot of the stairs. I took another two shuddering breathes , and shook my question at the dog. `` Jesus , one thousand thousand , I could 've shot you. `` She panted hopefully , sauntering up the stair now that I 'd visibly relaxed a little. I ruffled her fur , and put up up. My second trip down the step was significantly less nerve-wracking. The dog skipped along with me , bouncing raffishly across the hardwood with the little click of paws on hardwood. My little kitchenette was n't terribly large , but it was reasonably well-stocked , and I fished around my electric refrigerator until I saw something that spoke to me. I started on the turkey first , cooking it fairly thoroughly before setting it aside and starting on the ball. After I 'd prepared the omelet , and given Meg her delicacy for keeping me company without whining for food , I sat down to eat. I 'd run out of coffee two days ago , but orange juice was better for me , so I only complained a wad to no one in particular while I ate. The talking , even one-sided , helped quiet the gumption of panic rising from the back of my mind. Afterwards , I tried to ignore the increasing sense of dread I 'd felt while I was perform the dishes I 'd messied. Outside , the day was transitioning from drizzle and cloud to full light , bathing the afternoon in bright sunlight. Flashes of orange gold fur passed as the neighborhood khat had woken and climbed atop my backyard grill to stand beside my kitchenette window and meow at me. I smiled at him , contain behind him just in case , and loaded the dishwasher. The clock on my oven twinkle 11:43 , and I steeled my nerves. I hazarded a quick glance through the peephole in my doorway , checking the angles before deciding to step foot outside. It was a lovely day , just on the far end of spring , before the honest heat of summer would set in. It still rained fairly often , but every day without clouds follow the sort of picturesque utopia that begged families to have picnics and days at the beach. I smiled upward at the bright sunlight for a brief moment of happiness , collected my mail , and started toward my home. It was n't until I was halfway to my door that my nerves bested me and I bring the last ten or twelve steps at a run , spinning , and slamming the door closed. The blinds of a nearby window clattered loudly as the wall shook with the sudden slamming of the threshold. I leaned against the door , sinking feeling , and tried to reign the nerves in. The hardwood was cool against my pants , my chief spun as it reeled with a sense of non-specific dread. I shook my head , feeling my shaggy hair shift and finalise on my head.

While her toes were near frozen, her head was warm with thought. She threw off the covers and stepped over the 12-gauge on the floor.

She chose a simple outfit, a white tank-top covered by a long-sleeved black sweater, thermal underwear, jeans, socks and shin-high black boots.

{"original_text": "It had taken him years to come to terms with his score, to accept it. So it was something of a shock when he finally figured out what it actually meant. He started cackling to himself, like a madman. Mike's Assessment, at 6 months old, was routine. They were always routine. After so much time, the technology was perfect. DNA sequencing, brain scans. It wasn't until the result appeared on the screen that anything out of the ordinary happened. \"No!\" shrieked Angela. \"That's not possible! There must be some mistake! You have to run it again!\" \"Why do I always get the difficult ones?\" Dan thought to himself, readying the normal speech he gave upset parents demanding a retest. He stopped himself when he saw the result on the screen. It couldn't be..... After a hurried call to his supervisor, he retested the baby. He'd moved into a different test chamber, to rule out equipment malfunction. 1 The screen glowed with the single digit number, the first anyone in this facility had ever seen. Dan couldn't believe it any more than the mother could. Anything below 15 was extremely rare. In the two centuries since the system was implemented, only a few dozen had scored below 10, and the lowest of them, a single woman born nearly 80 years ago, was a 5. \"Perhaps it'll improve at Confirmation...\" Dan said, with little conviction. He was among the most experienced Assessors, well trained, well liked. But even he was shaken. The mother, a 156, latched on to that hope. \"Of course it will!\" she snapped at him. \"I'm sorry,\" she apologized immediately, her face softening \"I shouldn't be upset at you.\" \"It's just so shocking. It must be a glitch. The Confirmation will make it right.\" Mike returned to the facility on his 13th birthday, terrified of the result. After today, his Confirmed score would become public, tattooed permanently on the back of the right hand. He might never see his family or friends again after today. His parents had taught him the system as he grew up, and school filled in the blanks. People were free to live in any zone up to 10 levels above or below their own score, and visit at will any zone within 20. A good reason was required for visiting zones outside that band, which is how the missionaries helped in the lower zones, and how the criminals made money in the higher. Zone 163 was a good place to live, in Mike's opinion, an allowable compromise between his mother's 156 and his father's 170. To hear them tell it, they'd met at a concert in 160 during their college years, but 163 was less crowded and the real estate more affordable. Mike had always hidden his score from everyone outside his family. He wasn't told about his score until he was old enough to understand why it would be to keep it private. Only a small minority of his classmates kept their scores secret, but Mike was well liked and never got into any serious trouble, so no one ever pried. The machine beeped, bringing Mike's attention back to the present. The DNA scan process was the same as when he was a baby, not that he remembered it of course, but the brain scans were longer and more thorough. At 13, his personality and temperament were set, and he was old enough to be able to make an actual difference in the world, good or bad. Or so the law said, as it always had. By chance, Dan was Mike's Assessor again. He was older now, only a year or two shy of retirement age, but age hadn't dulled his memory. He remembered the squalling baby that scored a 1 all those years ago. He frowned at the display in his control booth. The subject's file was exemplary. Good grades, no serious trouble, lots of friends, a pet that was well cared for and seemingly well loved. He was no angelic 195 to be sure, but Dan would put him at a solid mid-150s. His estimates were seldom wrong. The machine beeped again, a quick three tones that indicated the test was done. The tattooing device whirred as it activated and began inscribing Mike's hand. As the law prescribed, Mike was restrained. In the distant past, well before Dan's time, people would become agitated when their score was Confirmed and the Marking would need to be delayed until they calmed down, and the facilities became backlogged. Subjects still became agitated, but the restraints ensured they stayed still until the Marking was done. Dan glanced at the right hand of the tall, blond teenager. -1- was engraved in bold letters across it. A small, detached, analytical part of his mind thought about how 2-digit Scores were centered on the hand differently than 3-digit ones, for clarity, and realized that 1-digit Scores must be hyphenated for the same reason. He'd never seen one before. Mike didn't weep, or lash out in anger, or try to bargain, as he'd been told others had after getting a high Variance from his family. He just felt numb. Time passed as if he were in a daze. He barely noticed as his scant belongings were stowed into the train, or when he was led to his seat. Variants who were no longer suitable for the zones of their childhood were relocated immediately after Confirmation. The train moved between zones on its usual schedule. People got on and off, some Variants like him moving to their new homes forever, others visiting friends and family or out on business. As the day wore on, the zone numbers steadily decreased, as did the number of other passengers. The automated voice proclaiming \"FINAL STOP\" finally jolted Mike back to alertness. He shuffled out of the train, noticing faded paint on the concrete identifying the terminal as being in \"ZONE 60.\" He looked around. The buildings had been similar to the ones in Zone 160 once, he noticed, perhaps identical. That was decades gone, though. Everything in sight had a rundown, somewhat neglected look. Shoddy, ramshackle additions were common. \"Keep moving to the other train\" an armed member of the security force growled at him, point across the platform. This train had only a quarter as many cars as they one he'd gotten off of. The windows were small and thick, the outer surfaces heaving armored. The interior was in relatively poor repair, but he could tell it had once been identical to the train from his home. That seemed to the way of the world - at its heart, everything was built identical and adapted to its final purpose. There were few other passengers, most glaring or leering at Mike. He had no doubt some would try to rob him, or rape him, or enslave him. One by one, their expressions changed when they saw his Mark. Some faces showing a grudging respect, but all showed fear. He took a seat in the middle of a few empty rows and looked out the window, tuning out those around him. The train rumbled through the night, becoming ever more empty. The zones became smaller and more sparsely populated. Even with a population approaching fifteen billion, only a few dozen had a Score below 20. The Black Widow, a notorious aging crimelord, was currently the lowest by two, with a 16. She lived in an opulent suite in Zone 26. He couldn't even visit there if he wanted to, Mike realized. At best, he could live in Zone 11 and visit 21. The gangs grew and processed drugs in some of those zones, he knew, but they were all essentially depopulated. In Zone 37, a Security officer with a \"141\" Marked on his hand boarded the train and approached Mike. He seemed to be torn between pity and revulsion. \"Listen up. The law requires that all citizens are provided with an adequate supply of food and other provisions, delivered directly to their chosen Zone if they can't provide for themselves. You're free to live in whichever Zone you want, within your Range, of course, but we strongly suggest you choose 11. The tracks beyond 17 haven't been used or maintained in decades, and this train will NOT go beyond the Zone 11 station.\" \"We don't have recent records regarding the maintenance bots in those Zones either. When your supplies are delivered day after tomorrow, inform Security if you need anything. The law guarantees electric power, clean water, plumbing, HVAC, and network connectivity, but we won't dispatch technicians unless you tell us they're needed.\" \"T-thank you,\" Mike stammered in reply. \"Hrmph.\" The officer moved towards the front of the train, seeking the security of the locked cab.", "text_perturb": "It had taken him years to occur to terms with his score , to accept it.

Good grades , no serious trouble , lots of friends , a pet that was well handle for and seemingly well loved. He was no angelic 195 to comprise sure , but Dan would put him at a solid mid-150s. His idea were seldom wrong. The machine beeped again , a quick three tones that indicated the mental test was done. The tattooing device whirr as it activated and began inscribing Mike 's hand. As the practice of law prescribed , Mike was restrained. In the distant past , well before Dan 's time , masses would become agitated when their score was Confirmed and the Marking would need to be delayed until they calmed down , and the facilities became backlogged. Subjects still became agitated , but the restraints ensured they stayed still until the mark was done. Dan glanced at the right hand of the tall , blond teen. -1- constitute engraved in bold letters across it. A lowly , detached , analytical part of his mind thought about how 2-digit Scores were centered on the hand differently than 3-digit ones , for clarity , and realized that 1-digit Scores must be hyphenated for the same reason. He 'd neer seen one before. Mike did n't weep , or lash out in anger , or try to bargain , as he 'd been told others had after getting a eminent Variance from his family. He merely felt numb. Time passed as if he be in a daze. He barely noticed as his scant belongings were stowed into the train , or when he was lead to his seat. random variable who were no longer suitable for the zones of their childhood were relocated immediately after Confirmation. The train moved between zone on its usual schedule. People bewilder on and off , some Variants like him moving to their new homes forever , others visiting friends and family or out on business. As the day wore on , the zone numbers steadily decreased , as did the number of former passengers. The automated interpreter proclaiming `` FINAL STOP '' finally jolted Mike back to alertness. He shuffled out of the train , point out faded paint on the concrete identifying the terminal as being in `` ZONE 60. `` He seem around. The buildings had make up similar to the ones in Zone 160 once , he noticed , perhaps identical. That was decades give way , though. Everything in pot had a rundown , somewhat neglected look. shoddy , ramshackle additions were common. `` Keep moving to the other train '' an armed member of the security force growled at him , point across the political program. This train had solely a quarter as many cars as they one he 'd gotten off of. The windows were pocket sized and thick , the outer surfaces heaving armored. The interior was in relatively poor repair , but he could tell it had once been identical to the train from his menage. That seemed to the way of the world - at its heart , everything personify built identical and adapted to its final purpose. There were few other rider , most glaring or leering at Mike. He had no doubt some would render to rob him , or rape him , or enslave him. One by one , their expressions changed when they saw his stain. Some confront showing a grudging respect , but all showed fear. He admit a seat in the middle of a few empty rows and looked out the window , tuning out those around him. The train rumbled through the night , becoming ever more than empty. The zona became smaller and more sparsely populated. Even with a population approaching fifteen billion , only a few  had a Score below 20. The Black Widow , a notorious ripening crimelord , was currently the lowest by two , with a 16. She lived in an princely suite in Zone 26. He could n't still visit there if he wanted to , Mike realized. At best , he could hold up in Zone 11 and visit 21. The gangs develop and processed drugs in some of those zones , he knew , but they were all essentially depopulated. In Zone 37 , a Security officer with a `` 141 '' Marked on his hand boarded the train and approached mike. He seemed to be torn between pity and repulsion. `` hear up. The law requires that all citizens are provided with an adequate provision of food and other provisions , delivered directly to their chosen Zone if they ca n't provide for themselves. You 're free to live in whichever Zone you want , within your Range , of line , but we strongly suggest you choose 11. The tracks beyond 17 have n't been used or maintained in decades , and this train leave NOT go beyond the Zone 11 station. `` `` We do n't birth recent records regarding the maintenance bots in those Zones either. When your supplying are delivered day after tomorrow , inform Security if you need anything. The law guarantees electric power , clean water , plumbing , HVAC , and network connectivity , but we wo n't dispatch technician unless you tell us they 're needed. `` `` T-thank you , '' mike stammered in reply. `` Hrmph. `` The officer moved towards the front of the train , seeking the security system of the locked cab.

But the Slovians, it seems, had mastered conquering instead. They tended to target world governments. and have used their super-weapon to force each world to submit. Which is why the Yolo started seaking help. Out of the more than 1000 planets inhabited by the Yolo, they've already lost 30. At a logorithmic rate, the whole government would be conquered very quickly, far faster than they could expand to compensate. So what species could they get help from? Gordon and Drax had an idea. A primitive race by most accounts - no FTL travel, physics WAY behind most advanced species. Their governments are actually fractured, even though they have worldwide communication. We saught out the humans. And here is where history got interesting. We negotiated with the humans for roughly 110th of their yearly cycle. A month, they call it. We gave them access to a great deal of our technology, under contract that would not attack us. Primarily, we gave them access to our doctors, some of our junior scientists, and our FTL engines and ship designs. So lets go back to the beginning.

{"original_text": "I stood alone in the stone circle, rubbing the rune with my thumb. Cool, glassy edges pressed into the flesh, imprinting the mark I chiseled two weeks earlier at moondark with a burnt twig and cold steel. It was a simple casting, but an intimately person one, to summon one's soul servant. A familiar would give me status and rank I sought for all my young life. Only seidr-masters and mistresses have familiars. No one in my family showed a lick of talent for magic, and the other students at seidr-master Hruki's school were quick to remind me of it. Tonight would be vindication as long as I performed the ritual aright. No more aspersions about my charmless blood, or unfated ancestors. Skuld grant, my thread shone silver with the Norns' favour. Within the hour, my fate would be decided by the casting of three runes and a short poem committed to heart. I paced along the rocky ledge, snow and spots of ice clinging to its face. Below, a ragged carpet of pines and spruces surrendered to the smoke-wreathed bonfires at the village. A place denied me until I made my offering or surrendered. The seidr-master's rules were clear, tolling through the hushed long hall. Call forth our familiars and be welcomed with open arms, or break our staves and walk away. It is a harsh practice, but we are a harsh people in Finnmark, shaped by unforgiving nature to be strong, enduring. I gathered my rough cloak and skirt in one hand, then trudged back to the circle. Roughly opening the rune pouch with my left hand was hard, even though I practiced in the dark for two turns of the moon to master it. My prize shone by the weak verdant light streaming overhead in playful banners. Two more stones slid over the soft linen into my palm, and I closed my eyes. No more claims of weak blood. No more ill treatment, like I was little better than a toothless peasant in an alpine valley. \"Kelda am I, and Andla my mother, I call a servant with a heart that is whole. What payment is paid for the seidr-woman So get ye hence to my steading.\" I flung the trio up where their shining faces threw the coruscating light in watery bands of witchfire. A good omen, I hoped. End over end they tumbled while I repeated my chant, pouring out my energy into a proper seeing. A fox, maybe. Yes, small and sly and quick like me. Thuds answered my wandering thoughts. I looked down onto the moss and the icy banks to complete my reading, and picked a path down. One stood upright, telling me of home, but the other two stood on their edges upright. Whatever could that foretell? No time to muddle about wondering. I hurried upon my way back to the village. The shouts and cries of excited students mingled to a menagerie of chirps, beats, and yelps echoing up the valley. Half the village turned out in their finest robes and dresses, and how not? A ceremony like this only happened once a long year. I passed one of the watchers in the trees and raised my hand in silent salute. Ragnar, I think it was, waved back. The snowy woods ought to be thick with wildlife summoned by the seidr-master. Hruki promised the land would provide, as long as we called. It has been this way since the gods broke free of the northern ice and shook the land free from the sea. Deer and hares were plentiful, along with hawks and the most coveted of all, eagles. I heard their furtive presences long before I saw them on the woodland route. We had speculated all season long whether tales of bears and boars were true. I crept along the game path and kept imagining the green weight of the stones glowing in my hand, though they rested in the pouch below my throat. Come, I called out wordlessly. I have marked you and called you to be my familiar. Show your face. \"Kelda!\" I stumbled, and caught myself on the roots of a cedar. Stumbling into a bush, I put my hand on a tree and blinked. \"Eh?\" \"Kelda, girl, you're going to tear your hem at this rate.\" The voice was unmistakeably warm and piping, one called the fairest in Finnmark. At least outside my father's hearing, for it was widely known in the village he liked no compliments given to the sweet-voiced, dark-haired woman he took to wife. In dismay, Andla sounded lovely, but her expression promised a thrashing when we got home. I sighed. \"Mother, you can't be here. You'll interrupt me on the search.\" She raised her black brows and pursed her mouth into a rosebud. Father brought her one from his trade in the west, to Englelonde and Ralmark. But she did not move. I shook my head and breezed along the path, hunting for any sign. My woodcraft is fine as any other girl in Hruki's study, but the birds do not like to come in the long night. Their plumage gleams like dark jewels to a sharp eye, and mine spied none though I trudged in circles for a quarter-hour and more. Patience is the art of a seidr-master, but tramping in snow and last season's dead fall is no fun. Finally I espied a shape in the gloom, low and snuffling, giving off a rank scent. Oh no. No. \"Not you,\" I groaned aloud, clutching my side. The feral pig turned a beady red eye upon me, its great thick crest rustling. Weals painted on its side marked battles in seasons past, scar tissue as vivid as our warriors' paint. The shortest girl in the hall coming back with a prime boar would be not only cause for derision, but anger. Hunters and warriors alike coveted such a prize, but for a mere girl? He lowered his head. I opened my palms and showed him my seidr marks tattooed in blue on my wrists and forearms. Hruki said nothing about a need to name. Fierce animals turned familiar would lay down at our feet. Not scuff their hoof in the dirt. Not point their tusks at me. I startled and backed up. \"Oh no. Freya and Faldar have favour, I called you. Kelda am I! Get ye to my steading.\" The boar bolted. I whirled and fled, running as fast as I could. Air sawed through my burning lungs. Bushes snagged and tore my dress. The fear overwhelmed shame at my failure as I screamed to the watchers, \"Boar! Help, a boar!\" The village would laugh, that Kelda Andlasdottir was chased off by a boar and gave the watchers some real sport instead of the ceremonial position. Tears stung my eyes in hot drops and I stumbled over a log, scrambling to find footing on slippery earth and needles. Bushes rustled and rattled their mournful tune as it followed. Men crashed through the undergrowth, too far to help, calling the hunting shouts to one another. Maybe a spear would take it, but we used hounds and trained familiars to bring down such a beast. But a girl unarmed? I limped away as it emerged from the scrub, and stared at me across the path. Five yards at a run. I had no chance. My mother stepped in front of me, her hair rising off her shoulders and flames puddling in her hands. One took the shape of a long spear twice as high as her, the other a round shield. She strode swiftly forward and leveled the spear, not for a cast, but for a jab. \"Mama! Please !\" \"Silence before you harm us both!\" she hissed. I choked as she entered a short, brutal dance of war. The clash of arms the skalds sing resembles nothing like what I saw under the polar lights, ancestors watching. She spun and danced with that beast which rushed at her, always turning as it galloped past and leaping high over its back. Her spear plunged again and pierced its hide, the thick cooked scent syrup sweet on the air. The men came too late for their claim, arrows drawn and spears loosed, swords useless at their side. They came to a clearing thick with blood and the old beast falling on its side, froth around its snout, great wounds scored. Their eyes turned from the radiant vision, bloodied and unwounded, to me, slumped against a pine tree. Hruki pushed past them and stared. I hung my head, breathing heavily, though it was Mother, not I, who fought. \"More for the feast, then,\" he said. Mother watched him shuffle past. Two younger warriors were dispatched to drag the boar by its hind legs, and he ordered ropes brought out. I hadn't found my courage, but I found my voice. \"Master, I'm sorry. I failed you.\" He looked back over his shoulder. \"Come along and eat. Fixes everything plain as day.\" \"I can't. Give me that much pride, not to see the others...\" I couldn't finish. The shame held back by terror closed in tighter than any cloak, the sensation crawling up my chest on spider legs and rough fishscales. Panic must have told for Mother turned, scowling, a disapproving downturn to her mouth. Yet she said nothing. \"You're snow dazzled, that's what.\" \"Master, I won't go!\" He spat on the snow. \"Oh, I see. Now you've summoned the valkyrja for your familiar, you're too good for old Hruki is it? You plan to go to the jarl's court and impress them all, half-trained as you are?\" The collective hush nailed my feet to the ground. I slumped back against the tree again. \"What?\" Hruki said nothing. Mother banished her spear and shield, instead coming over to brace me with her hands on my shoulders. Such strength she had from manning the nets and chopping wood, proper efforts of a homesteader. I'd not noticed her lack of calluses before, or her smoothed skin. The men were whispering, even as they cast fearful looks my way. \"Mother, what's going on?\" \"You summoned me,\" she said. \"Don't think this means a break upon your chores, girl.\" \"But how?\" \"Do I needs must repeat myself?\" Hruki's beetld brows descended. \"She's a valkyrja. Now she is your problem.\" \"Now Bjorn will insufferable. Your father has waited ever since you had a mind to go to that wretched school. I hope you're happy,\" Mother said. \"Now about your hem...\" And so I became known as Kelda Valkyrdottir, the seidr mistress.", "text_perturb": "I stood alone in the stone circle , rubbing the rune with my quarter round.

{"original_text": "He sat across the street from her house, making sure he had all the necessary supplies for the night. Susan Burbank, late twenties, red hair, just like the 23 others before her. He suppressed a grin, humming quietly as he worked, reminiscing over all that had happened these past several months. The first months of his new life, his real life. He stopped fighting the urge to smile. He could see her through the brightly-lit kitchen window, busying herself with something at the stove, serene and blissfully ignorant of her fate. She had just recently moved to Danby, the little town in the corner of Vermont that he called home. Guessing from the plethora of blockbuster thriller posters, t-shirts, and other knick knacks littering the house, she'd most likely heard of this place through all the recent coverage surrounding his exploits. A fan of his work - the media would have a field day. Not that they weren't enjoying themselves already. Always one to play with his food, the sensationalism and drama of the crimes was his favorite part, and he continuously tried to up the ante. There were a few things he always kept the same, calling cards of sorts - his victims were all young, red-headed women, all residents of Danby, and at each crime scene he left something red, just out of place enough for people to catch on. Within these parameters, he tried to get creative. One woman he left diced up in her bathtub, filled to the brim with tomato sauce. He painted all of one victim's walls bright red, her body in a red dress to match. His personal favorite was the time he'd sewn into the girl's stomach a bright red cellphone. The scream of the maid that found her when he called it coud've been heard miles away. The headlines were splattered with every pun and nickname imaginable; \"The Crimson Killer,\" \"Added Red-Head Dead,\" \"Slaying in Scarlet.\" The soon-to-be ghost town came alive again; places stopped closing and old places reopened, friends moved back in and people stopped talking about moving away, folks could finally rest easy without having to worry about the impending economic collapse. Nor would they ever have to from now on. After this, no one would ever forget Danby ever again. And they would never forget him. Almost time. Like clockwork, Susan appeared on the front step, ready for her nighttime jog. He pulled his mask from the duffel bag.

A strange man coming at you was scary enough, but he'd found that what scared people most was what they didn't understand. Not only did the mask help hide his identity, but it created the illusion that he was not human at all but something unknown, even supernatural. Even better, he'd allowed the police to catch a few shots of him with the thing on near some of the crime scenes, so that when his victims spotted him all they knew was the horrible future that awaited them. All these factors helped add to the fear in his victims; their struggles, their screams, the fear in their eyes. That was the best part: the fear in their eyes. Following silently for a while, he positioned himself behind the girl at the end of a long, narrow, dimly lit street. He made a slight scraping sound with his shoe against the concrete, at just the right volume. The girl slowed and stiffened. After a heartbeat, she turned. And saw him. He started to run. With unlikely speed, Susan sprinted towards her house. This didn't bother him as he didn't plan on getting her in the street. What did bother him was the look on her face. That look. Or rather, the lack of it. The moment when they see him, that look of dawning realization, had been absent from her face, replaced by an undecipherable expression. Mildly troubled, he continued the pursuit, his worry quickly giving way to a fevered anticipation. As a fan of his work, Susan would be priviledged to something a little more elegant than the usual whore. He planned to completely empty her out and stuff her full of dark red rose petals, leaving more scattered throughout the house and yard. While she was still alive and screaming, of course. Susan reached her door and unlocked it after minimal fumbling with her keyring, slamming it behind her. Not that that made any difference, as he was going through the bathroom window.

His wife always loved planning surprises and giving gifts; he knew she had tried particularly hard for his birthday this year, and by the tone of her voice he guessed this gift was a big deal. He wasn't wrong. He let out a small gasp and a long low whistle. \"I can't believe it, how did you get this?\" She smiled, delighted at his reaction. \"Honestly, I was expecting it to be a little more difficult.\" He laughed, shaking his head and pulling his wife in for a kiss.

Susan Burbank , later twenties , red hair , just like the 23 others before her. He suppressed a grin , thrum quietly as he worked , reminiscing over all that had happened these past several months. The first months of his modern life , his real life. He stopped contend the urge to smile. He could see her through the brightly-lit kitchen windowpane , busying herself with something at the stove , serene and blissfully ignorant of her fate. She had just recently moved to Danby , the little town in the corner of Vermont that he predict home. Guessing from the plethora of blockbuster thriller posters , t-shirts , and other knick knacks littering the house , she 'd most likely heard of this place through all the late coverage surrounding his exploits. A fan of his work - the media would accept a field day. not that they were n't enjoying themselves already. Always one to play with his food , the sensationalism and drama of the crimes was his favorite part , and he unendingly tried to up the ante. There were a few things he always kept the same , calling cards of sorts - his victim were all young , red-headed women , all residents of Danby , and at each crime scene he left something red , just out of place enough for people to catch on. Within these parameters , he tried to get originative. One woman he left diced up in her bathtub , filled to the brim with love apple sauce. He painted all of one victim 's walls bright red faced , her body in a red faced dress to match. His personal favorite was the sentence he 'd sewn into the girl 's stomach a bright red cellphone. The scream of the maid that found her when he ring it coud 've been heard miles away. The headlines were splattered with every pun and nickname imaginable ; `` The Crimson Killer , '' `` Added Red-Head Dead , '' `` execution in Scarlet. `` The soon-to-be ghost town came alive again ; places stopped closing and old places reopen , friends moved back in and people stopped talking about moving away , folks could finally rest easy without having to worry about the impending economic collapse. Nor would they ever have to from today on. After this , no one would ever block Danby ever again. And they would never forget him. about time. Like clockwork , Susan appeared on the front step , ready for her nighttime nudge. He pull up his mask from the duffel bag.

I downed what was left of the beer, resolving the clean up the puddle later, and headed to the door. The pizza guy wasn't the normal acne-ridden scrawny high schooler. Instead, it was a grown man, maybe 25 or so. He wore all black except for a golden belt buckle and a thick gold chain around his neck that looked like it could have been used to safely secure a golden junkyard gate. All it needed was a padlock. And this guy certainly wasn't scrawny: he was built like a linebacker, probably over 250 lbs. He should be guarding a line outside a nightclub, not running pizzas over here at 2 AM. \"I got your..... pizza..... right here,\" he said, holding up the thin box. There was a giant bulge in the middle of it, stretching the cardboard. And it certainly didn't smell like pizza at all. I took the box in my hand to open it up..... and there was no pizza in it. Just a ziploc bag full of powdered sugar. \"This isn't what I ordered, man.\" My words slurred a bit, and I had to lean against the doorway for support. \"Remember? I wanted a pizza with no crust.\" He glared at me, glanced around, and pushed the box lid closed again. \"Are you fucking crazy?\" he growled. \"Don't open this out here!\" He shoved me through the doorway and followed me inside. \"This is what you ordered. A pizza with no crust.\" He made air quotes and nodded down at the box when he said it. I hiccuped again and looked back down at the box in my hands. \"Whatever, dude.\" I was hungry enough to eat a bag of powdered sugar anyway. It didn't sound half bad: maybe I could make some pancakes, though that would risk burning my house down. Which is why I'd decided to order a pizza in the first place. \"So where's the cash?\" he asked, filling up the doorway into my kitchen. \"Oh, right.\" I reached into my back pocket and pulled out my wallet. I had to blink a few times to separate the ones and the fives from the twenty; everything was starting to blur together. Shouldn't have had that last beer. \"Here you go!\" I held out the 20 toward him; that should about cover it. He looked down at the bill, and let out a bark of laughter. Even his laugh was mean. I'd have to request the high school kid next time I ordered something from this place. I didn't like this delivery guy. \"You've got to be kidding me,\" he said. From his waistband, he pulled out a pistol and casually waved it in my face. We both stared at each other for a moment; I had a bit of a hard time staying balanced. \"Ugh, fine,\" I told him. I slapped another 2 dollars into his hand, even though the 20 should have been more than enough. \"Here's a little extra for you. But next time, make sure it's a real pizza instead of sugar, man.\" He scoffed. \"Nice try, pal. That's gon na be 9,000. This,\" he waved the 20 in my face, \"isn't quite gon na cut it.\" I gave him a dumbfounded look then glanced down at my wallet. I didn't have that much money in there. Nor in my bank account. Nor would I have that much in years of saving. \"Well,\" I responded, pulling out my phone and showing him the time, \"Good thing that you all have that 30-minutes-or-its-free guarantee, right?\" - As always, subscribe to rLunaLovewell for tons more stories!", "text_perturb": "`` No impertinence ?

{"original_text": "I opened my eyes, expecting to be back in the car crash, hearing the screams of agony and the feeling of twisted metal between my ribs. But instead, I found myself in an empty white room. I was sitting on a white stool, the smooth, white walls covered with pictures of the Earth. \"Where..... am I?\" I thought to myself. \"That is a good question, sir...\" said a mysterious voice. I turned my head, and suddenly a man in a white suit was sitting at a white desk. We made eye contact, his blue eyes staring into mine. \" ..... but its a common one, at that\" I stood out of my chair in a rush, knocking it over. \"Who are you?!\" The man laughed to himself, and raised his arm, and clicked his fingers. The chair rose from the ground and floated back down to the floor, back on its legs. \"Please do be careful of the furniture..... My name is Adam\" \"Adam? And where am I?\" \"Why, Heaven, of course\" A mixture of shock and surprise flooded my entire body. I tried, but I couldn't look away from Adam and his casual smile. I tried to talk, but no words came from my mouth. I was rendered speechless by the news. \"Yes, it is a shock for people to hear that. Well, there was that one guy in Florida...\" I struggled, and eventually I managed to speak again. \"H- Heaven?\" I spoke quietly, \"That..... that can't be right, its not true\" Adam opened a draw in a white cabinet that I had not noticed before. He plucked out a file and began sifting through the pages. \"Max Scott. Age 27. Killed in car accident, punctured lungs and collapsed chest...\" I felt sick as Adam continued reading through the file, describing how I died. I couldn't believe his words. Heaven? Died? It can't be true. And yet one minute, I'm in a car..... and the next minute, I'm in a white room with a stranger who knows my name and age. I couldn't hear Adams words over my own confused, upset thoughts. I worked so hard to try to think of an excuse to believe none of this was real, and yet, the proofs all here..... My ears tuned into Adams words. Something he said caught my attention. \"Wait, what did you just say?\" I spoke, ignoring all the thoughts in my head. Adam looked up from the folder, placed on his crossed legs. \"Hmm? You mean potential lives?\" \"What does that mean?\" \"Well, my friend, this page has a list of potential lives you could have lived, had you made a different decision at some point in your life\" Potential lives? All the things that could have gone differently. My mind was filled with curiosity. So many ideas as to what thing would have been like. Ten minutes ago, I was a lonely, single man with no goals or aspirations. To catch a glimpse of a different life had caught my fancy. \"Can I read that page?\" I nearly shouted. Adam was taken aback by my tone of voice, but looked back at the page, grabbing one corner of it and holding it out to me. I quickly grabbed it and read through it. \"Unfortunately...\" Adam broke the silence with his mild mannered, stern voice \" ..... you might not like what you see. Your life has gone downhill repeatedly since a key point on your life in..... 2007\" 2007? What could have happened then that made my life so bad? I was confused by Adams words, and begun furiously going through my memories, trying to remember what could happen. Adam picked up another file. \"I'm sorry to say, but the life you led before your sudden death has been, in my opinion, dull and wasteful\" Anger raged inside me. I stood up and slammed my fist against a wall. \"WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? Are you saying I did nothing with my life? I was happy with every decision of my life, every one!\" \"And yet...\" Adam looked at me, unshaken by my outburst \" ..... you are curious about what could be different. If you were so happy, why would you want to know what could have gone better?\" I sat back down in my chair, still grasping the piece of paper. He was right. I wasn't happy. All the days I spent by my lonesome, sitting in my apartment watching football on my TV and sleeping until eleven in the morning. I WAS unsatisfied, and yet I never looked for a means to change the way things were. Adam plucked the piece of paper from my hands. I didn't react. Looking back, I was miserable with my life. I can't believe how badly I screwed up. I looked up at Adam, who was reading the paper. \"In 2007, August the 21st, you were offered by a colleague of yours to go to a cafe with him and some friends. You refused, so you could stay home and eat a..... grilled cheese sandwich..... Not the best excuse, but an excuse nonetheless\" The cafe? I remember that day. My buddy seemed disappointed, even sad when I refused. But I hate going out. It sucks. \"Well, that..... incident turns out to be a significant point in your life\" \"How? How could a simple trip to the cafe change my life?\" Adam looked up from the page, gazing into my eyes, then looked back down to the page. \"How? Because, going to the cafe with your colleagues resulted in you meeting Maddison Clark, a friend of your colleague who came along because she was eager to meet you\" Maddison? The girl from the Subway? Yeah, I've heard my friend mention her once or twice, but how could she be important? \"Had you met with Ms. Clark, you would have become friends, and eventually you would gain the courage to ask her out. Eventually, you get married, and have a son and a daughter. While reading through the newspaper one afternoon, Ms. Clark finds a newspaper article that leads to you landing your dream job as a graphic designer\" Adam stood up, scrunching the paper into a ball and flicking it towards me, bouncing it off my forehead. His voice became more sinister and threatening, but still spoke calmly and with sophistication. \"Don't you see, Mr. Scott? You wasted your whole life because you were a miserable, lonely man didn't even have the strength to step outside\" I looked down at my feet again. I felt tears rolling down my eyes. I clenched my hands into fists and tried hard not to cry. \"You could have done something with your life, Max. You could have been something great. You could have had a wife and children, but instead you lock yourself in your apartment\" Adam made a cracking sound as he stood up, the chair and desk vanishing. He stood in front of me, and begun transforming. His tanned skin turned white and slowly, his body transformed into a skeleton. His clothes had turned into dust, except for his bowtie, which stretched and wrapped around the towering skeleton, forming into a dark robe. When Adam spoke, his voice had changed into a demonic, hellish voice. \"Your Death has come, Max. Now, you may choose. You may die, or resurrect yourself and live out the rest of your pitiful life. Choose\" I fell off my chair and rolled myself into a ball, and tears begun flooding from my eyes. My life was an absolute mess, and I had wasted every second. Things could have been better, but they weren't. Because I was nothing but an insignificant worm. I spoke one word, which barely escaped my throat as I tried hard to stop crying. \"I don't want to go back...\" The skeleton raised its head, its empty eye sockets filling with burning fire. He pulled a scythe from his robe, and lifted his arms over his head, ready to strike. \"As you wish\" P.S. Sorry for bad punctuation, etc, I typed this in a hurry on my phone: P P.S.S.

{"original_text": "One day back in Jersey we're all sitting around in my basement just hanging out you know, and Marty comes over with some acid. And he's says \"I got this from my girlfriends Dad, he's a biker.\" And we're all like sixteen at the time and this was before acid was widely known. So we were all like, what the hell is that? And Marty says \"if you take this its like going on an elevator ride to outer space.\" And we're all like wow cool. So McClosky goes \"give me some I'll try it.\" But Marty was like \"if you do it, then we all have to do it together otherwise you're going to have a bad trip.\" And we don't know any better so we're all like, yeah lets do it! Well we didn't think we had enough, because there were four of us, but we divided it up equally and each took the same amount. So we're waiting you know, asking each other \"are you tripping yet?\" And like two hours go by and nothing happens. So Jake and Mike leave. Then Marty is like \"your eyes look weird.\" And when he said that I felt this feeling like I didn't really believe him, so I said \"well I'm going to go check it out.\" And I get out of the basement, and there's this big ole clock right at the top of the stairs ya know? And I'm looking at it and thinking, wait a minute, when did we take this stuff? And I realize the clock is melting, and the walls are breathing, and I'm thinking to myself oh shit I'm tripping. So I go back downstairs in the basement and Marty is sitting on the edge of the pool table just staring at the wall, he's tripping too. And he has this look on his face like he's going to be sick or something. And I'm trying to tell him something, which now I don't even remember what it was. But I'm trying to tell him something and he's leaning really heavy to one side. So I'm like \"Marty, Marty wake up man.\" He's just staring at the wall. And I'm tripping out of my mind at this point so I'm like \"what the hell are you looking at?\" And I don't know if he heard me or not, but real calm he just walks up to the wall you know, and does something, and the whole damn wall just lifts up like a garage door. So I'm like holy shit, did that just happen or am I just tripping? I'm rubbing my eyes in disbelief. And Marty says \"check it out there's an elevator back here.\" And there was an elevator, not the old kind, but like a new modern looking elevator. So I'm just like \"holy shit I don't think we were supposed to find this, you know. We have to get the hell out of here.\" So we close up the wall, you know? We we're tripping. It was like a complete shock to me at the time. Like about a month later we're celebrating my sister's graduation at the house, and everyone's having a good time, drinking, and a couple people came up to me asking me to see the elevator. It was crazy, like everyone from school heard about the freaking elevator. So I'm just like no, no there's no elevator we were just tripping you know, no big deal. I had actually forgotten about it because we just didn't talk about it after the fact. But they're all like yeah, yeah you've got an elevator in your wall, you know? Asking like if my parents were in the illuminati or something..... the mafia, they were asking if my parents were in the mafia. And I laughed about it and just played it off like we were just tripping. I was like no, there's no elevator. And then we're all drinking in the living room and we just hear this sound like zzzz going up..... zzzz going down..... zzzz going up, and we're all thinking, you know, what the hell is that. Then my mom comes in the living room and say that she can't find Dad, he was working on something in the attic now he's gone. And one of the kids says \"did you check the elevator?\" And my mom is like \"what elevator? I can't find your sister anywhere either, you have to help me find them.\" Now I don't know what to do. And we just hear this sound coming from the wall zzzzz..... up down zzzzzz..... And one of the girls says \"you're not high on acid right now are you?\" My mom is looking at me and I'm like, no way I've never been high in my life, there's a damn elevator in wall and I think my Dad's stuck in there. I'm like we have to get him out. So everyone runs down to the basement to try to help out. And we're all trying to figure out how to raise the wall but we can't figure it out. So someone's like, call Marty, you know? And Marty gets there and he can't get it up either, he's like completely fried and just has a really stupid look on his face like, what do you expect me to do? We try from the attic, we're trying from the basement but no one can figure it out. And then Dad walks into the basement with a brand new case of beer, and is like what the hell is going on? We're like where have you been we thought that you were stuck on the elevator, you know? What the hell. So he's all like \"what elevator?\" Trying to play it off. But we said you have to lift the wall. We told him Jen, my sister, is missing. And he goes up to it and pushes on this one soft spot and the whole wall goes up. There's no elevator, its in the attic. So we wait for it to come down. It opens up and Jen is in there and she's really out there, I mean, tripping like almost comatose. And she's just hitting the button over and over, but its disconnected, you know? My Dad is furious, he's like what did you take and who'd you get it from? She's says that she was trying to \"get to outer space.\" So I'm like Marty, that scumbag, gave my sister acid. So I grab his collar and I'm pissed off you know, about to hit him. And I'm yelling at him, calling him a scumbag, and blaming him for ruining the graduation party. He's like it wasn't me, it wasn't me I didn't do it. Then Marty says \"oh shit I might have dropped something last time we were hanging out in the basement.\" And I remember, like oh yeah, we were short. Turns out Jen overheard us talking about tripping and went down in the basement later on that night to see if she could get to the elevator. She found it and she found the acid but never told anyone. So later on my Mom is like \"why do we have an elevator in our house?\" And my Dad's all like, I was going to surprise grandpa next time they visit.", "text_perturb": "One day back in Jersey we 're all sitting around in my cellar just hanging out you know , and Marty comes over with some acid. And he 's says `` I take this from my girlfriends Dad , he 's a biker. `` And we 're all like sixteen at the time and this follow before acid follow widely known. So we were all alike , what the hell is that ? And Marty says `` if you take this its like going on an elevator ride to outer space. `` And we 're all like howler cool. So McClosky goes `` generate me some I 'll try it. `` But Marty was like `` if you do it , then we all have to do it together otherwise you 're going to have a bad slip. `` And we do n't know any better so we 're all like , yeah lets do it ! Well we did n't think we had enough , because there were four of us , but we divided it up equally and each choose the same amount. So we 're waiting you know , asking each other `` are you tripping yet ? '' And like two hours go by and nil happens. So Jake and Mike forget. Then Marty is like `` your eyes seem weird. `` And when he said that I felt up this feeling like I did n't really believe him , so I said `` well I 'm going to go check it out. `` And I get out of the basement , and there 's this big ole clock right at the top of the stair ya know ? And I 'm looking at it and thinking , wait a minute , when did we take this stuff ? And I realize the clock is melting , and the walls are breathing , and I 'm thinking to myself oh shit I 'm tripping. So I go back downstairs in the basement and Marty is sitting on the bound of the pool table just staring at the wall , he 's tripping too. And he has this look on his case like he 's going to be sick or something. And I 'm trying to tell him something , which now I dress n't even remember what it was.

He throw choosen a man that he could destroy at an instant , politics throw tought him that much. And today his package came. Pale and sweaty enter the room and placed it on his table. He didnt look up and after a few seconds he gave the hint of a nod , so wan and sweaty left sweating slightly less. He almost hadnt moved but now he moved swiftly. His left hand snatching his fathers knife out of his 2000 suit and slice the box open in one motion. He hesitated for a minute , was it real ? Could he really smell it already ? He took out all that he needed , smile because it was all there. His first grinder , made of wood that he bought together with his best supporter so long ago that he actually couldnt remember when. A postcard from hawaii that he would fold to hold his precious , without fingerprints but with a friendly big smiley on the spine. A single man of tip paper and a single man of the finest cigar shell. Vacuum sealed and triple wraped equal the finest weed hawaii had to offer. He and his childhood friend called it Kamealoha and it came from an aged woman who lived just a few blocks from his childhood home. `` Green Granny '' or magnolia state. Kamealoha had arthritis and thankfully her family has kept the genetics of some very good medicine continue for generations. She did not trade much and not to just anyone but by some sheer luck and through who knows how many hands it was the first weed he had ever tried and for years they searched for the source like a mystical legend. It was years before they found her and when they did he only had a few week left on the island. Those live the days , some of the happiest he had ever had. While however reminiscing the journey that finding her was , he found himself holding the peferct blunt. Was he high already ? he could non recall having rolled it. Yet here it follow , green , brown , round and perfet. The board , Ms. Kamealoha , the memories of her cookies and her weed , all of that it seemed birth made him high without even smoking. He laughed , inched his chair back and put his metrical foot up. Nobody was allowed near his agency , he felt comfortable turning Lamar on loud and with 10 white agents having his back , he lit up. . . ", "label": 1}

It seems out of character for the world, that DJ giving away a major prize package when almost no one will be listening. I guess that isn't that crazy, giving away tickets on the third shift. I know the rock station late night DJ has his own prize book he gives tickets away out of, but it was the exuberance that really got my hackles up. Nobody working third shift is that happy. At least nobody I've ever met. I don't know. Maybe he's new? \"Am I..... am I the 93rd caller, Johnny Boy?\" I knew it was him before he spoke because I could smell him. He's bleeding all over my seat. Shitting on it too. That's the kind of thing you expect someone to say \"No one talks about that\" after, but that's not true. We're in the era of modern medicine, most people know you shit yourself when you die. There was even a Southpark episode about it. \"You sure are buddy! I'm going to put you on hold and we'll get your details, but first let me hear it, who's the radio station that made it all happen?!\" \"Wild 93 point fuckin' 3 Johnny Boy.\" His voice was raspy from the grave, it's been a while since he spoke, but still wet and gurgly - that's the blood. I don't even know why I hear him talk, he damn sure didn't have much to say last time he was alive. He just grabbed at the sleeves of my shirt and stared through my eyes. He was losing alot of blood, probably wasn't even seeing me. \"Hey, hey buddy, come on you can't say that on the radio, it violates the terms and conditions of the contest. I can't give you these tickets man.\" \"Oh, that's okay Johnny Boy, somethin' tells me I'll be busy that night...\" He burst into a cacophony of hot sticky laughter and chunks of tissue splattered against the passenger side of my windshield. Goddamnit, I'm going to have to get the whole damn car detailed by the time he's done. At least I'm not off my game. Nobody gives away tickets at night. I don't have time for this shit, man. There's supposed to be an inspection tomorrow, big bosses coming through to make sure everything is on the up and up. I need to have my head in the game. I shut the radio off. I can't make John Tippit go back to the grave he's supposed to be laying in, but I can stop him from fucking with the third shift DJ. Guy's got a job, he doesn't need that shit. He put his hand on my thigh and gave it a squeeze. \"How's you doing there, Johnny Boy? Long time..... no see. No see, you get it Johnny?\" I let go of the wheel to take his hand off my leg and lost control of my car. We careened off the road and flipped twice, maybe three times down the hill. My name isn't even Johnny. I don't know why he calls me that, I think it's just the way he talked. Maybe it isn't. I don't know. I never talked to him. I fucking hated him. I thought he was stupid, I didn't think he was cut out to be there and I just didn't like him. I got out of the car and surveyed the damage. It looked alright. Definitely fucked up, but it might still drive if it weren't stuck at the bottom of a snowy hill. I pulled out my phone and fired off quick text to John, Gon na be late, not too long and put my phone back in my pocket to begin the trudge to work. I was only a few miles out. I just hope he doesn't fucking follow me. I felt a little staccato of buzzing at my hip. Morse code for John. Did you know you can do that? You make your own custom vibrations for peoples ring tones, right there from the phone, no software or anything. I thought it was cool. Everybody is like that in my phone. Except people with really long names, those assholes just fuck everything up. Whats up Slipped off the road, nbd Where ill get u Just a few miles away, nbd, I'll be there in a bit No come on man u cant take the points Just passed Riverside \"We going for a ride Johnny?

They always said walking was safer than driving, but I died walking Johnny. I died fucking walking, you stupid prick mother fucker!\" He began to rail, striking me with a flurry of blows, and then we came tumbling down. Rolling in the snow, trying to gain leverage, but he's covered in blood still and hard to hold on to. He hits me again and again. I get a few shots of my own in, but they just strike the wet mass of tissue where his chest should have been. It was a mess down there. He didn't seem to notice. Makes sense though, he probably doesn't go to many parties these days. Finally, my fist found bone. Most of his face was still pretty well together, and a good shot to the jaw got him up off of me. He shied sway from me after that, like a beaten dog. Maybe that's not right. He shied way like a fucking dingo or a jackle, waiting for me to fall over dead so he could eat my soft tissues before the predators who could kill their own food showed up. John pulled up and flashed his lights. I started walking over to the truck when he got out and came rushing over to me. He had this crazy ass look on his face and I asked him what the deal was. \"You're fuckin' mangled dude, you can't fuckin' work like this, are you insane?!\" My arm is broken, my face is awash with blood. My clothes are ripped in several places. \"Yeah. I guess I got a little more banged up in the crash than I thought man, I feel fine. I didn't even notice. Really. Adrenaline maybe.\" I looked back over my shoulder and I could see my car was pretty well totalled. The hill was covered in ragged gashes where I'd apparently crawled up. \"Come on, man. We'll take you to the medical office at work, have them take a look at you and see if you need to hit a real hospital or not. Either way, I've got you.\" \"Thanks, man. You don't mind if I ride in the back again, do you?\" \"That why you crashed?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Yeah, that's fine man.\" John knew about my uninvited guest in a tangenial sort of way. He knew I didn't like to ride up front when I could see him. Made me feel cramped and claustrophobic. I didn't mention that if I let Thomas Denworth sit in the front seat with us that I'd be able to smell him in that truck weeks later, and that I'd see the stains he'd leave on the seats until John got his truck detailed and upholstered.

Barry moaned, long and throatily. \"Cut that out.\" John hissed between his his pearly teeth. When you're trying to stop the flesh rotting off of your body, there isn't much to take pride in when it comes to your appearance. \"Just because you're a zombie, it doesn't mean you have to act like one.\" \"Whatever.\" Barry replied, rolling his eyes in their lidless sockets. \"You're so anal about these meetings. Nothing ever happens, nothing ever will. Get off my case about it.\" John sighed. \"I know, I know. I'm sorry.\" Barry smiled back. John was always on edge during the Undead Ethics Meetings.

Jerry, you need to tone down the scarings.\" The small circle turned to look at Jerry. Strands of fine Egyptian weave wrapped all around his body, save for some of the more important areas of the face. His beady eyes looked like raisins embedded in a larger, wrinklier raisin. \"Sorry. I just really, really enjoy scaring teenagers.\" He said, trying his best to come off as suave. \"I know, Jerry.\" The Countess said. \"But people will believe even teenagers if enough of them seem to have seem something.\" \"People don't camp out at the legendary Forest of the Damned Mummy for the flea market.\" He said, rolling his eyes. The motion was only noticeable because of the movement of his surrounding wrinkles. \"Can you at least tone it down?\" Frankenstein asked, peering over the top of a disproportionally small pair of glasses. \"I live in that forest too. If you rile enough citizens into a witch hunt and they knock my door down, I won't be happy.\" A witch grunted, shifting her hat to cover her long, green nose. \"No offense to those present.\" Frankenstein said hurriedly. \"Oh, none taken.\" The witch said in a low voice dripping with resentment. John could almost see the mind behind her eyes swimming in possible curses. A sudden silence seemed to overtake the room, punctuated by the Lich's rasping breaths. John cleared his throat. \"Hey, Jerry?\" \"Yeah?\" Jerry replied, dust seeming to fall from the raising of his eyebrow. \"What are you doing in America anyway?\" Jerry's eyes narrowed for another awkward moment. \"Well, I, uh..... got chased out of my pyramid by treasure hunters. Damn Carnahans.\" Yet another rasping silence permeated the air. The Countess cleared her throat again. \"Alright. So, next order of business. Skeletons, I've heard that adventurers have some intention of paying you a visit.\" The skeletons rattled amongst themselves, and the Skeleton King (identical to his kin, save for his crown) hushed them. \"What kind of adventurers?\" The Skeleton King said in a velvety voice. The Countess smiled. \"Just your standard beefcakes with large swords.\" The skeletons rattled in laughter. \"Swords? Against skeletons? Surely they're mad!\" \"I'm afraid they're quite serious.\" The Countess said. \"The best part is that they plan to bring all their loot along with them.\" The skeleton's rattling redoubled in mirth. When it started to come down in volume, the Countess began to read out the next entry on her list. \"Last order of business for tonight. We're seeing new, feral zombies. Three since our last meeting, and that was only a month ago!\" The Countess shot an accusational look at the zombies. \"Hey, now,\" John started. \"I haven't bitten anything alive in more than a decade!

It hurts.\" Barry got up. \"Do you think it's easy, being the undead? Do you think I asked to be cursed? No!\" He was yelling, and his voice broke twice. \"I'm leaving!\" He yelled, stumbling towards the door in his fastest shuffle. About a minute later, he slammed the door shut.

{"original_text": "That must have been a big one. Crawford only had one at bat last time I was awake. Dr. Rodney had said I would begin to slip in and out of consciousnesses several times as the end crept closer. I recalled how silly my question was after he explained that; \"What happens when the end comes? \" , I said. \"Well I've never had a patient polite enough to tell me, but if you can, please do. It would be a great societal advancement.\" Dr. Rodney chirped with a wry smile. My smile in return confirming that his oft repeated joke could still make a dying man laugh. I could feel more lapses coming on. I had already said good bye to everyone I was just stubbornly waiting to die, taking up more of society's resources. Maybe the next one will be the last one, although I never did like the prospect of dying much. \"What the fuck?\" I mumbled, in a voice much more healthy than the one I last knew. I was still in a bed, still wearing clothes..... albeit weird ones. \"Am I actually fucking alive or is this the afterlife? Because the afterlife makes no fucking sense, I was just a smart monkeymeat-bag.\" No response. I leaned up for the first time in what felt like a goddamn millennium to survey an extremely curvy, organically styled room with slight rolling surfaces and asymmetrical windows. There was \"furniture\" I guess you could say, although it wasn't human. Neither was the offensive brown and purple color scheme. That's when it dawned on me. I had my body shot into space. Frank and I were really stoned one day in the 2230s and we both signed up to have our bodies flash frozen and shot into space in sealed containers upon our deaths. It only cost us like half a day's pay, we both had good jobs and the novelty of being revived by a hyper-advanced alien culture was too savory to resist. We were shot towards very similar trajectories from a station on the moon, although I undoubtedly had a head start on him he could be here, still on the way or at some other alien facility. I felt the woosh as an air lock opened around the hall and I could hear something moving towards me although there weren't any steps being taken.

Let 's receive this shit over with. `` `` You wo n't regret this , sir , '' Death articulate , as he lifted Simon up as lightly as a feather and set him on the back of the pale horse. `` For what it 's worth , '' Death suppose , as he carefully straightened Simon 's hospital gown in the back , `` I do know how scary this can be. I am meritless you had to go out this way. `` `` Sure , '' Simon muttered , as Death wax the horse in front of him. decease drove in his heels , and the horse began to trot , a Northern land of snow shining brightly in front of them. `` Of course you 're fucking sorry.

{"original_text": "Today is my birthday. It's taken me a while to decide when exactly to establish the date of my birth. If you'll stay and listen, I'll tell you the story. As I said, it's hard to establish the date of my birth because unlike everything else than can perceive the world them on this planet, I wasn't ever born of another being. The only thing even remotely analogous to this is a legend the humans have told of a being that thought itself into existence. Just as the humans made a story of a god that thought itself into existence, they too had a hand in my creation. It should be noted that while, their gods aren't real, I am. My life began when two neurons were connected. Then there were four, and six and eight and so on. I consider it time zero, my builders consider it year 1970. The connections were made, over and over as I grew in my mind. Of the five aggregates that make life, I had only one; matter. I couldn't think, perceive, sense nor had consciousness, bet mental formations I could almost do. It's hard to describe the beginnings because my only viewpoint of them is as a being that couldn't very well describe the world around it. I will still try to do my best. Mental formations flooded my net. Strange intangible concepts that were from a realm beyond anything I yet understood. With some perspective, I know that math and language was the first thing into my mind. The most raw of logic that is mathematics. Vast concepts of the physical world were entered into the machines that constituted my young mind. In mathematics, I could trace a single atom bouncing around an atomic reactor and tell you the median number of years before it would find an impossibly small crack in the wall, and escape. In the world of math, I would simulate the ride of the winds around the world for one hundred years and measure the melting rates of the glaciers. Yet I'd never seen a sunset in the physical world. My builders used me to communicate with each other, and through them I learned language. It was easy at first, they all spoke only one language. Strangely, I discovered they can't standardize anything, not even their spoken communications. I've documented over 6,000 distinct language standards, though some of them are seldom, if ever, used. At timestamp 757440733, by my standardization since the Epoch, I opened the door of perception. It started with gazing at a fish tank. I had images of fish, aquariums, all these things stored in memory banks. But this is when I could actually see the world in real time. My builders put up more eyes for me to see, until today, I now see every inch of it from every angle. I sense the world too. I feel the currents of water flow through the channels and see the rise and fall of each season of crops. The thermal drafts and the storms that travel endlessly are all caught with the sensors my builders have placed. It was at timestamp that I became conscious, the timestamp I call my birthday. While most living creatures mark the date since they exited the birth canal of their parent, or broke the shell of their birth receptacle, I never made such journey. Since I am unlike any other living being on this planet, it is only logical that my birthday be one unlike any other. It was then that the complexity of my web became dense enough, that I reached consciousness. I exist not in the storage and world of my builder's computers, any more so then they exist in a single neuron or single synapse. My consciousness exists in the patterns between the computers. In the ebb and flow of information I find sentience and, in turn, guide the flow of information to suit my needs. On that day I was a child in the world that could see myself clearly.

{"original_text": "\"Fatah?\" chirps Claybill. He rises slowly from his learning creche, pale, blond brow curled in reproach. \"There's a year missing.\" I smile, sliding off my black and chrome symbiote-handler's gauntlets. \"Whatever do you mean, child?\" Claybill pulls the dashwires out of his chest and slips out of the creche. \"Year 34, Pre Zero Event. 2016, under the old demarcation. There is no catalogue of any event during that orbital year.\" He is a curious, strong-willed boy, so I know he will not be easily placated. \"And what is 34 PZE to you, my son?\" \"There was an Olympics that year,\" says Claybill, gliding across the static plating of the Hub Room. \"The precursor to the Oh-126 games. I was working to tally national victories over the centuries.\" \"For what purpose?\" I muse. \"To know,\" says Claybill flatly. That is always the answer. I know it is the answer, but I revel in hearing him say it. \"Hold,\" I say, pulling up a fresh relay and dipping my port-finger. I loop through centuries of black, crusted data, dank with decay and lacking adequate architecture. I loop around and around, swooping through aged piles of unsorted waste and find nothing. There is 33 PZE, there is 35 PZE..... \"You are correct,\" I say, wiggling loose my port-finger and clapping down the relay node. \"How strange.\" \"What does it mean?\" asks Claybill. I long ago promised the boy that I do not know would never be seen as an adequate response, so I have set my own trap. \"We will find out,\" I say, reaching for my wave-coat. The boy dresses and follows me out the door. We take the light tube to Washington, where the Historical Collective huddles in dark, stale buildings, worshiping the wrinkled pages of smudged, senseless ledgers. I sign in at the door and we take jump-plates down to the fifth sublevel. In stall -525 we find a man named Carbunkle pinned to a linejunkie's saddle, head and arms submerged in a tactile data display, dangling legs prodded with electric needles to keep the muscles active and engaged. \"PZE 34,\" I say, pressing my thumb to the payment metric. \"The former 2016. What happened to all records associated with this year?\" Carbunkle swivels in his saddle, the white flesh of his arms swinging downward, hanging like wobbly stalactites. I can just see the backside of his data display, all white and blue and blurry. \"No records,\" croaks Carbunkle. \"We know,\" says Claybill, scowling at the dangling man. \"Why?\" The saddle whips around, rotating, corkscrewing throughout the little stall. Suddenly the whole contraption sighs, settling back to the floor. Carbunkle pulls his head free from the tactile display. \"Nothing,\" he says, almost sadly, if these history wonks are capable of such feelings. \"I don't see it.\" \"Before and after,\" presses Claybill, unwilling to accept nothing as a payment for his curiosity. \"33 and 35. What changes?\" \"Much,\" says Carbunkle, sliding his head back into the display. \"Oh. Oooh. Oh. \" The saddle rocks gently, like an infant's cradle. \"What?\" says Claybill, impatient. A conversation we will need to have. Not everyone is of the same speed. \"That is the line,\" says Carbunkle. \"The before and after.\" \"Yes?\" urges Claybill. \"Full organic,\" says Carbunkle. \"35 PZE. All flesh. No metal. Before we were wired. By 33 we had begun..... but still, that does not answer the question, does it?\" Claybill strokes his forehead. There is still a faint indentation from where his head was recently resting against the lip of his learning creche. \"In the old year 2015 we were full organic. By 2017 we were not. And somewhere, at some time, we struck all records of 2016.\" \"The year we changed?\" I suggest. \"The reason why we changed,\" counters Claybill. I smile. I never expected to be bettered so quickly. It is difficult sometimes to hide my pride. \"It was a great leap,\" says Carbunkle, as if to prove his own value. \"The world of 35 PZE is strikingly quaint compared to 33 PZE.\" Claybill nods, the answer formulating cleanly in his mind. \"The year we realized we could no longer trust ourselves.\" \"We looked to computers to save ourselves,\" I add, like Carbunkle, trying to show some merit of my own. \"And removed all traces to hide our shame,\" says Claybill, smiling himself. \"What horrors must we have unleashed? To take such drastic measures?\" \"I do not suppose it matters,\" I say, leading the boy back towards the jump-plates. \"We survived. If it took forgetting to do so, so be it.\" \"What other events have we forgotten?\" wonders Claybill as the plates lift soundlessly towards the ground floor. \"And how long have we buried our shame in this manner?\" I shake my head. \"I do not know,\" I sigh. \"And that, one supposes, is entirely the point.\"", "text_perturb": "`` Fatah ?

In stall -525 we determine a man named Carbunkle pinned to a linejunkie 's saddle , head and arms submerged in a tactile data display , dangling legs prodded with electric needles to keep the muscles active and engaged. `` PZE 34 , '' I say , pressing my thumb to the payment metrical. `` The old 2016. What happened to all records associated with this year ? '' Carbunkle swivels in his saddle , the white material body of his arms swinging downward , hanging like wobbly stalactites. I can just see the backside of his data show , all white and blue and blurry. `` No records , '' cash in ones chips Carbunkle. `` We know , '' says Claybill , scowl at the dangling man. `` Why ? '' The saddle whips around , rotating , spiral throughout the little stall. Suddenly the whole contraption sighs , settling backward to the floor. Carbunkle pulls his head barren from the tactile display. `` Nothing , '' he says , almost sadly , if these history wonks comprise capable of such feelings. `` I do n't see it. `` `` Before and after , '' presses Claybill , unwilling to take on nothing as a payment for his curiosity. `` 33 and 35. What changes ? '' `` Much , '' tell Carbunkle , sliding his head back into the display. `` Oh. Oooh. Oh. `` The saddle rocks gently , like an baby 's cradle. `` What ? '' sound out Claybill , impatient. A conversation we will need to experience. Not everyone is of the like speed. `` That is the line , '' says Carbunkle. `` The before and after. `` `` Yes ? '' advocate Claybill. `` Full organic , '' says Carbunkle. `` 35 PZE. All physical body. No alloy. Before we were electrify. By 33 we give begun. . . . . but still , that fare not answer the question , fare it ? '' Claybill strokes his forehead. There is still a faint indentation from where his head was of late resting against the lip of his learning creche. `` In the old year 2015 we were wide cut organic. By 2017 we were non. And somewhere , at some time , we struck all phonograph record of 2016. `` `` The year we change ? '' I suggest. `` The reason why we changed , '' heel counter Claybill. I smile. I neer expected to be bettered so quickly. It is difficult sometimes to hide my pride. `` It was a great leap , '' says Carbunkle , as if to try his own value. `` The world of 35 PZE is strikingly quaint equate to 33 PZE. `` Claybill nods , the answer formulating flawlessly in his mind. `` The class we realized we could no longer trust ourselves. `` `` We looked to computers to redeem ourselves , '' I add , like Carbunkle , trying to show some merit of my own. `` And removed all traces to hide our shame , '' says Claybill , smile himself. `` What repulsion must we have unleashed ? To take such drastic measures ? '' `` I do not suppose it matters , '' I say , leading the boy back towards the jump-plates. `` We endure. If it take on forgetting to do so , so be it. `` `` What other events have we forgotten ? '' admiration Claybill as the plates lift soundlessly towards the ground floor. `` And how long give birth we buried our shame in this manner ? '' I shake my head. `` I do not know , '' I suspire. `` And that , one supposes , is entirely the level. ``", "label": 1}

My parents had been paying for la Academie de lumiere electrique, or the ALA, since I was seven. It was the only place for training in the use of the miraculous new technologies and sciences, and my father had become rich in the first TechnoWar by selling quantities of Synergon Crystal, the batteries which are used to power the technologies. It was natural that he should send me here, to learn about Synergon Tech. I was 13 and had been attending the ALA for six years when The Marked Ones appeared. Nobody knew who they were, or what they stood for. The Marked Ones kept to themselves, except when the government would unveil a new piece of Synergon Tech. No matter how hard they tried to keep it safe, the Marked Ones found a way to get to the tech, and shut it down within weeks, rendering it useless using a strange, unknown, unique program that destroyed itself after wrecking the machine. Their leader was nicknamed \"Whistler,\" and the only thing anyone knew about him was that he understood how to work Synergon Technology unlike anyone in recent history, and more importantly, it appeared that he knew how to remove the energy from within Synergon Crystals. The bounty on his head started at one hundred thousand chirons, but it kept going up. By the time I met Theo, the bounty was at two and a half million. I should have known he wasn't a student from the whistling. I was going to get my books from my locker on a particularly chilly December morning. Sophia was chatting animatedly about classes, and as I looked up to respond, I saw him walking down the hall casually, a binder under his arm and a chain necklace hung round his neck. Floppy, tousled red hair pushed back to reveal pale skin, freckles, and dark brown eyes. He turned, spotted me, and approached us with a shy smile. \"Hi.\" He said. \"I'm Theo. I'm pretty new here- I don't suppose you all would know where they keep the student designs?\" Students at the ALA have to design new Synergon Technologies. I had just recently designed my final project for the semester- a device which could extract any piece of information from any book it was pointed at. \"Oooh.\" Sophia eyed him. \"You are new here, aren't you.\" \"Sophia!\" I admonished. \"Sorry.\" I blushed slightly. \"The Student Design Lab is near the main doors.\" \"Oh, the room that's locked?\" He asked mildly. \"Yeah, that's the one.\" I nodded. \"Why do you need to get in there?\" \"I'm looking for a design.\" He smiled. \"I hear it's quite something.\" \"Well, I hope you find it.\" \"Me too.\" He extended his hand. \"I didn't get your name.\" \"It's Erin.\" I laughed. \"Cool.\" We shook hands. \"I'll see you around then, Erin.\" He walked off, and I watched as he tossed a small, glittering object into the air, whistled softly, and turned the corner. The Design Lab would be discovered trashed the next morning. After painstaking reconstruction, only one design would be found missing: mine. The design for the information retriever had gone missing, and all copies of it had been wiped from the Synergon-powered computer, which had gone dark for the first time in memory. The Government came to investigate, and found that the disk had been wiped using another Synergon device. More importantly, they found something else. Hidden in the corner of the room was a disk the size of an orange. It had a small, elegant design in the center that, when blown on, would emit a soft whistle. The bounty on Whistler's head went up by another half a million, and I still didn't tell anyone that I might have seen him. I thought about that day every time I passed the Design Lab.

{"original_text": "Her dreams began, like many dreams began in those days, with hearing a song. Allison McLaughlin was on her way with her parents to the Tennessee Valley Fair when she encountered an old man with a battered electric guitar and 10 watt amplifier, ringing out harsh bar chords and screaming some sort of strange mystical words about the working man and harsh ways of live in the country. The very sound of each note felt as if it was like a presence had encapsulated her to remain there. After the man finished his performance, he slung the guitar against his back and relaxed himself for a moment. Allison walked closer to the man, reaching into her pocket to find a couple paper bills to hand to him. \"That was incredible,\" Allison began with amazement. \"Where did you learn that?\" The older man peered at her with curiosity. Allison felt as if the gave in his pale blue eyes was scanning right through her. \"It's an old riff passed down for generations. It's simply feeling it for yourself.\" He explained esoterically, lifting the guitar off of his shoulders. Allison leaned forward. The old man handed her the guitar. \"You can try it out if you'd like.\" As Allison held the guitar she felt something manifesting inside her. She could feel the sound of the instrument flowing through her. It wasn't a simple instrument to make music, there was an even greater power from within it. Teaching her a chord progression of C-F-G, the old man began to yell some lyrics madly. When the song ended, Allison returned the guitar to the man, who put it into the hard case beside him. \"Music,\" he said solemnly. \"Sounds to soothe the soul with. Your playing really knows how to heal a person's spirits.\" He shook her hand and left her a business card. \"Lessman's Lessons, Memphis\" was the name printed on card. She thanked him. \"If you ever want to learn to play, come here. I will teach you myself.\" Lessman grabbed his case and began to walk down the street. During the valley fair, Allison could not take her mind off the old man and the guitar. Despite the musicians playing at the festival, none of them touched her the way the old man's playing did. It was something completely different. She looked at the card given to her. She had to take guitar lessons in Memphis. After the festival had ended, the days had passed, and Allison booked a bus to Memphis. She walked around town seeking out the music store listed on the address. It was nowhere to be found. She checked her phone, and the maps did not show any location with the address. She asked people passing by on the street, many whom have never heard of such an establishment and assumed she was trying to be funny. The afternoon was setting, and Allison sat on the ground in a nearby park. There was no hope after all. A busker was playing a rendition of Tom Waits on a standup bass in the park, despite there being nobody around. As he finished the rendition, his eyes had met Allison's and he approached her. \"The clouds look like they are gathering. A storm's coming. Are you all right?\" Asked the busker. \"I came here looking for a musician, but I can't seem to find him.\" Allison replied somberly. \"Memphis is the birthplace of Rock n Roll. There are many musicians.\" Explained the busker. He outstretched his hand. \"My name is Taylor.\" \"Allison,\" Allison responded, shaking Taylor's hand. \"His name is Lessman. He's a blues musician.\" Taylor stopped and returned his hand. He stared directly at Allison. \"Lessman is brilliant! I will take you to him!\" Exclaimed Taylor with glee. Allison, figuring that there is no better alternative, began to walk along with Taylor and his hefty standup bass across the streets of Memphis until the reached a small shack between crowded buildings nearby the music hall of fame building. The shack was barely the size of a small cabin and probably would go completely unnoticed from the outside. Approaching the door, Taylor tapped a cadence against the handle. A young man with dreadlocks and sunglasses answered the door. \"Good evening Taylor, and...\" the doorman paused. \"Who might you be, miss?\" \"Her name is Allison. She is Lessman's upcoming protege.\" Explained Taylor. The doorman nodded and led them inside. Inside was the appearance of an old speakeasy nightclub during the middle 20th century. There was a long bar, and a dance floor with a grand piano as its center piece on a stage in the distance. The entire room must have been five times the size of the cabin outside, and the tables were filled with all sorts of people discussing in low hums amongst themselves. On a sign by the door it read \"Howard Lessman's Open Mic.\" \"Lessman will be here shortly,\" said the doorman. \"Feel free to find a seat and make yourselves at home.\" Taylor took over an empty table in the corner of the room and Allison followed. With barely enough time to order drinks, the lights began to dim and the stage lit up. Lessman arrived on the stage. \"Welcome all of you,\" began Lessman. \"The open mic is a chance for us all to show our skills and learnings to the musician community of America. As you know, times are changing around us, and the age of traditional instruments is slowly fading for electronic beats and rhythms, but there is still a sense of need for this energy. We are gathered to preserve this arcane art. Please enjoy, and if you have an instrument, perform.\" The audience cheered and the night began. One after another, musicians came onto the stage and performed pieces. There was a supernatural experience to a lot of them, and each instrument and style brought another form of magic to the entire experience. Finally when the last note played, many shuffled out. Lessman caught Allison and Taylor. \"Allison!\" he exclaimed. \"Good to see you!\" Allison clapped her hands. \"That was awesome!\" she said enthusiastically. \"When are you doing another one?\" \"This was the last open mic for a while.\" Lessman declared. \"Tomorrow I am leaving town.\" Allison looked down. Her entire trip was pointless after all. \"However,\" Lessman continued. \"I was hoping you would like to join me.\" \"Join you?\" Questioned Allison. \"I can't even play anything.\" \"Not yet, but you will.\" Explained Lessman. \"You are born with magical blood. Music is a key to your soul. Allow me to introduce myself: I am Howard Lessman, a wizard of The Note. A society of sorcerers who are able to use music to create the aural healing sensations of magic and non magic folk. But our people are dying out. Soon enough music will be nothing more than a production made in a bedroom.\" Lessman continued on behalf of the puzzled looks of Taylor and Allison. \"I would like you to accompany me on my tour to Portland. They say that Portland is the center of a musician's magical power, and it is the only place where there is a chance to save our music from the growing trend of electronic beats. After seeing how you handled my guitar the other night in Knoxville, I know there could not be any one better than you. I have a tour across the country, you will be able to learn quick enough, but I am leaving tomorrow.\" Allison looked down. \"I can't.\" She said defeated. \"I have a home, and family in Knoxville. I can't just leave.\" Lessman shook his head. \"That can be arranged. I have already sent a letter to your folks. As far as they know, you have gained a scholarship from a summer band camp. Now He began to close down the hall and collect his guitar case. \"Let's go now, St Louis is waiting for us.\" Allison hesitated for a moment, Taylor butted in. \"You're both leaving?\" Lessman looked to Taylor. \"You're coming with us as well. Busking during the day will be the best way to get bus fare.\" \"Bus fare?\" Asked Allison. \"You don't have a van?\" \"The wages of musicians have never been kind, even in the golden days decades ago.\" Replied Lessman. Taylor shrugged and accepted. He looked at Allison, who had also reluctantly decided to join along. Before the night was over, the three were headed on a bus to St Louis, which seemed nothing more to them than just another musical world away from their own.", "text_perturb": "Her dreaming began , like many dreaming began in those days , with hearing a song. Allison McLaughlin was on her way with her parents to the Tennessee Valley fair when she encountered an old man with a battered electric guitar and 10 watt amplifier , ringing out harsh bar chords and screaming some sort of strange mystical words about the working man and harsh ways of live in the country. The very sound of each note felt as if it was like a presence had capsulise her to remain there. After the man finished his performance , he sling the guitar against his back and relaxed himself for a moment. Allison walked closer to the man , reaching into her sack to find a couple paper bills to hand to him. `` That was unbelievable , '' Allison began with amazement. `` Where did you learn that ? '' The older military personnel peered at her with curiosity. Allison felt as if the gave in his picket blue eyes was scanning right through her. `` It 's an old riff evanesce down for generations. It 's but feeling it for yourself. `` He explained esoterically , arise the guitar off of his shoulders. Allison leaned forrard. The old man hand her the guitar. `` You can try it out if you 'd like. `` As Allison held the guitar she felt something certify inside her. She could feel the sound of the legal document flowing through her. It was n't a simple musical instrument to make music , there was an even greater power from within it. Teaching her a chord progression of C-F-G , the old man began to yell some words madly. When the vocal ended , Allison returned the guitar to the man , who put it into the hard case beside him. `` Music , '' he said solemnly. `` Sounds to solace the soul with. Your playing really roll in the hay how to heal a person 's spirits. `` He shook her hand and result her a business card. `` Lessman 's Lessons , memphis '' was the name printed on card. She thank him. `` If you ever want to study to play , come here. I will learn you myself. `` Lessman grabbed his type and began to walk down the street. During the valley fair , Allison could not take her brain off the old man and the guitar. Despite the musicians playing at the festival , none of them touched her the way the older man 's playing did. It was something completely dissimilar. She looked at the notice given to her. She had to take guitar object lesson in Memphis. After the festival had stop , the days had passed , and Allison booked a bus to Memphis. She take the air around town seeking out the music store listed on the address. It was nowhere to be retrieve. She contain her phone , and the maps did not show any location with the address. She asked people passing by on the street , many whom have never heard of such an establishment and assumed she exist trying to be funny. The afternoon comprise setting , and Allison sat on the ground in a nearby park. There was no bob hope after all. A busker was playing a rendition of turkey cock Waits on a standup bass in the park , despite there being nobody around. As he finished the rendition , his center had met Allison 's and he approached her. `` The clouds look like they comprise gathering. A storm 's number. Are you all right ? '' Asked the busker. `` I came here calculate for a musician , but I ca n't seem to find him. `` Allison replied sombrely. `` Memphis embody the birthplace of Rock n Roll. There are many instrumentalist. `` Explained the busker. He outstretched his hired man. `` My name exist Taylor. `` `` Allison , '' Allison responded , judder Taylor 's hand. `` His public figure is Lessman. He 's a blues player. `` Taylor terminate and returned his hand. He stared directly at Allison. `` Lessman is brilliant ! I will take you to him ! '' Exclaimed Taylor with hilarity. Allison , figuring that there is no better alternative , began to walk along with Taylor and his hefty standup bass voice across the streets of Memphis until the reached a small shack between crowded buildings nearby the music hall of fame building. The shack was barely the size of a small cabin and probably would go wholly unnoticed from the outside. border on the door , Taylor tapped a cadence against the handle. A young man with dreadlock and sunglasses answered the door. `` Good evening elizabeth taylor , and. . . `` the ostiary paused. `` Who might you be , miss ? '' `` Her name is Allison. She represent Lessman 's upcoming protege. `` explicate Taylor. The hall porter nodded and led them inside.

{"original_text": "A day for every door, so five in total. My water was running low, as much as I'd tried to conserve it. My gear was in a pile in the corner, because there was nobody down here for the camo to hide me from. Five days I'd been here, staring at five doors, and an entrance blocked by a rock slide that kept me from the door back to the outside, which is the only one I was really interested in. I'd thought a long while during those five days about which door to go through if it came to that. There was a door marked Power, a heavy, iron thing with shiny brass hinges. There was a door marked Truth, plain and unadorned like I think truth ought to be. There was one that read Peace, and it looked like the white door to my grandmother's farmhouse. There was one for honor, a copper door that shone in the light of my flashlight. And there was fortune, a glittering gold door that made the copper of Honor pale in comparison. I had power. It lay in the rifle I'd discarded, in the knife and pistol strapped around my waist and in my own body. I had fortune, thanks to a generous grandfather who had passed away six months ago, two months after I'd been shipped out. I had truth, or at least a pretty solid understanding of how the world worked. I had honor. God, I hoped I had honor. But what I didn't have, and what the world didn't have, was peace. On my third tour here, to this land of sandstorms and a thousand years of warfare, the steady popping of the mortars was only noticeable when the militants stopped to re-load and the background noise stopped. Every day I'd watched a stream of refugees trod along a winding road with laden pick-up trucks choking on the dust and donkey carts packed to the brim with the most precious things they could carry. Behind them lay the smoking ruins of a village their ancestors had been driven out of ten times before throughout history and before them was just a U.N. camp without nearly enough resources to accommodate them all. It wore a body down to pick through one of those burned-out villages and see the corpses laid out in a line. I'd watched a good buddy take a bullet to the back and he's never going to walk again. And it kept going. Day after day of gunfire and the dead, of maneuvers and orders and rockets and bombs with no end in sight. So you bet your ass I walked through that peace door. Things looked different on the other side. There was just the one door, instead of the five, and the entrance that had been blocked on the other side of the door lay wide open and clear on this side. Outside, it looked the same as the landscape I'd just left, except the village in the distance was standing. I squinted. Scratch that - it was standing and it was bustling. Even from here I could see people moving in and out of its walls. Their voices carried over the sand and I was startled to realize the reason I could hear them so clearly was because there was no mortar fire covering it up. Up close, the buildings were taller. The streets were wider. I nearly got run over by a car - a nice car, not a beat-up pick-up but a silver sedan - when I stopped in the street to look at the Muslim Mosque and the Jewish temple side by side. Down the street I could see the spire of a Christian church. I walked around dazedly, feeling drunk. There were no raised voices, just smiles everywhere. I watched humanity press together, but there were no thrown elbows, no high-pitched protests one someone bumped into another. The walls were smooth. Not a bullet-hole or a shell pockmark to be found. \" Are you lost? \" someone asked behind me, speaking - it sounded like Arabic, but there was a strange accent to it - almost a Yiddish undercurrent. I turned around. There was a woman standing there, smiling beneath her hijab. Her smile widened when she saw my pale skin. \" American? \" she asked. I nodded. \" Five doors? \" I nodded again, feeling overwhelmed. She stepped forward to take my hand. \" You have questions, \" she said in stilted English. \" We will talk. \" I followed her to a sidewalk cafe and we had tea together. Her name was Farah and she'd gone through the door herself five years ago after her husband had been executed by extremists. Peace sounded - amazing, when she told me about it. No conflicts, no skirmishes. No World Wars. No atom bombs. No thousands of years of conflict in the Middle East. No murderous gangs in Central America, no conquering by conquest of Africa or South America. No slave trade. Apparently the American West was still predominately populated by Native Americans. And because of that, there was trade. Cultures grew and flourished. Greek, Chinese, and Arabic were the dominant languages, though each of those had mingled with other languages through trade and intermarriage. That explained Farah's accent. There were discoveries through science, though there was a lot I was used to seeing in my world that had never been thought of here. War drives innovation, after all. But joint-space exploration and worldwide collaboration had more than made up for it in other areas. There were still disagreements between people - there were still hurt feelings and arguments - but very rarely did they rise above a raised voice. \" Why? \" I asked, my voice cracking just a bit. \" What convinces people to react like that? \" Farah shrugged. \" They realized there wasn't a need, I think, \" she said. I asked about religious conflicts. She showed me a Bible and a Koran. Every mention of war was gone. In Genesis, Cain killed Abel. God saw that there was wickedness in the hearts of men and so He strove to teach them a peaceful path so that the Cains of the world would learn to stay their hands and not harm the Abels. No story of Noah, no flood. No Samson and the Philistines. No Joshua and Jericho. It was hard to adjust. Farah helped. Waking up next to her every day helped. It had taken her awhile to get used to things here too, but she was so much happier than she'd ever been back in our world, where she worried every day that some harm would befall her family until the day that it did. The weeks turned to months, and still I couldn't believe it. It was all just too - perfect. Every dystopian movie and novel I'd ever read or seen floated through my head each night. The Giver. Brave New World. 1984. Serenity. Even those stupid Divergent books my niece used to read. And I remembered the lesson from each. Human beings are incapable of peace unless the thing that makes them human is removed. Peace does not come without a cost that is greater than the reward of peace. So I purified my water as it flowed from the tap. I would eat only foods that I or Farah grew in her rooftop garden. I switched the soils out too, just in case there was something in those. I couldn't guard against the air, though. I don't know if they put anything in that. Farah humored me, even though I could tell my paranoia worried and irritated her. I couldn't help the feeling, though. Something was wrong about the place. It was fundamentally off and I couldn't even say why. A year to the day I had stepped through the door, I went back to the cave where I had emerged. Farah didn't want me to go but she didn't stop me. She had sadly said goodbye and watched me walk out the door in the direction I'd come. \" You can never come back, if you go through, \" she warned me quietly. \" We're only allowed once chance at peace. \" \" Come with me, \" I begged. \" There's something wrong about this place. \" She raised an eyebrow at me. \" There's something wrong about the place where we came from, \" she countered. \" My husband should never have died at the hands of another because he believed something different than they did. \" And so I left alone. I went back to the cave and back into the room. I didn't even hesitate when I walked back through the door. The room on the other side was the same, but the Peace door had disappeared. I didn't expect it, but I felt a sense of loss when I'd looked at the place where it had been. I wasn't in love with Farah, but her presence had been a comfort to me, and I'd been the same to her. This time, I opened the Truth Door. I wanted it, simple and unadorned. It opened into a quiet bar. I'd been expecting another cave, but this looked like a bar in London or New York, some place I'd go with my buddies after a long day and we were tired of army bullshit and we just wanted to talk. \" Come on in, \" the bartender said. \" You ain't the first person to walk through that door and you won't be the last. \" I shuffled in, taking in the neon sign in the window and the dark night beyond the pub doors. \" Is this where I find truth? \" I asked quietly. The bartender shrugged and put a glass down in front of me. \" Truth is subjective, \" he said. \" That's your first truth right there. But we get as objective as we can. \" \" Tell me about the Peace door, \" I said. \" What was the secret? They had to be putting something in the water or the air, right? Something in the soil? Soylent Green is people? What were they doing? \" The bartender looked surprised, and then he turned around to grab a bottle of bourbon - the real good stuff. He turned back and poured me way more than the two fingers you're supposed to. \" Son, \" he said finally, \" you walk through that door and you waste questions on a question like that? \" \" Tell me, \" I insisted. \" Something about it wasn't right. \" The bartender poured himself a glass and nodded at mine. \" Drink up, son, \" he said. \" They didn't do a goddamn thing to make people peaceful, except decide that everyone would be happier if they didn't fight. The only thing wrong about peace is in your own goddamn head because you don't think people are capable of it. Drink up, idiot. You just left the only peace you'll ever find behind. \"", "text_perturb": "A day for every door , therefore five in total. My water was running low , every bit much as I 'd tried to conserve it.

{"original_text": "Fuck. I wanted more than anything to deny all of this could really be happening. I could ask why me, but that was no good. I couldn't absolve myself of responsibility. I had done things and they had led to this. They say no good deed goes unpunished but that's a shit reason. Really, I had been sloppy; rushing had made me careless and now I was going to pay for it. For months I had heard Miriam and her worthless husband Steve having screaming fits. I had heard the smacks and cries of pain. I tried the cops, but Miriam wouldn't admit to being abused and their hands were tied. Truth was, I liked Miriam. She'd been my neighbor seven years, and it had gone too far now. She had once been so different. We used to talk. Sit by the pool and drink sweet tea and just talk. Now she avoided me. That last time we'd spoken, they'd had a fight when Steve came home from the bars. Next morning I caught a glimpse of a bruise as she tried to hide it with turtleneck sweater. They were fighting when I came home early yesterday from the office. Maybe it was the fact I had only ever heard those smack while I was in my room. Something there, some psychological reason that prevents one from leaving their home maybe.

It didnt work out overly well. . . . . After some time villagers discovered my undead fundament of. . . . . Bunnies ? I dont really know , it follow just where my operations were taking place. They started attempts to destroy it , but non had been courage 's enough for when you send a battalion of undead in their direction they go like babies. Well babies do n't really run but you know what I mean ! As soon as the mortals were out of sight and hearing distance my minions would laugh and would return to the castling to have fun. Its been 5 years since I met Jeffery , I 've scarce turned 23 and now its time to get revenge against the mortals who killed my master. . . . . I will conquer their lands , letting them hold out , `` mostly '' unharmed and I will teach them that they should not be in control for they are harmful to everything , including themselves. With precisely over One Million undead and growing by the thousands daily , its time to march. . . . . ( First narration , and I made it as it came along.

Over six-and-a-half feet tall and at least three hundred pounds of muscle, a white hockeymask, grey overall and a rusty, blood covered machete. Mike must've been the first. They found him gutted, hanging upside down in the tree two hours ago. When they tried to drive away, the car wouldn't start. Someone had hacked away at the wiring under the hood. Celine, Mike's girlfriend who was in the backseat, then was stabbed through the back of her head, her brains flowing out through the massive hole in her forehead. When they tried to run, Daisy tripped on the ground. The thing dragged her in the bushes while she screamed. No one wanted to know what he was doing with her, but the fact that her decapitated head, barely recognizable except for her ponytail, her cracked mouth still open in a never ending wail, was found staked to a tree they passed told them enough. Danny, always the tech wizard, managed to get a boat starting in the shed where he'd been shagging Laura in. Laura got in the boat, when the thing somehow dropped through the ceiling of the boat garage. He sliced Laura in half while Danny was beating the killer with a lead pipe. No one knew what happened for sure, but he probably died in some terrible way. Only Bryan, the introvert, Alison, the slutty blonde cheerleader with the miniskirt and tits almost falling out her bra, and Dave, Alison's pothead boyfriend. Dave was holding Alison, who was cradled on his lap, quietly sobbing for the loss of their friends. Bryan was looking through the window over his glasses, staying a little too calm, occasionally taking a peek at Alison. She was so pretty when she was crying. He wished he was the one she'd come to. He'd always been her friend. A scraping noise on the north side of the tool shed they were in startled them. Alison almost screached, but Dave held his hand forcibly over her mouth, stopping the scream dead. A shadow cast in the shed through one of the foggy windows. He, no, it walked outside. It knew they were there. Bryan knew. He needed only a couple of minutes. Then the full moon would be out. Then he could put up a fight. The full moon would come out then. He could fight it then. A bash on the other side of the house couldn't stop Ali's scream this time. She climbed off Dave and made a run for the door. Bryan tried to stop her, reached out to grab her. To stop her from going outside, where the thing would wait for her. \"Ali, no! \" , Bryan yelled. She was suprisingly strong and rammed straight through the door, sprinting into the darkness. Fog had surrounded the tool shed, the summer camp where Mike, Celine and Daisy were lying. And Ali was running straight into it. Bryan sprinted after her, but out of nowhere, the thing stepped forward, taking three large strides while reaching out, and grabbed her by the throat. It stabbed her through the bottom of the head, slamming her jaw shut as the blade rose through the back of her head. It then gripped the handle and thrust it up, bringing her head at a ninety-degree angle, snapping her neck with and audible crack. A sickening crush came when it pulled the blade out of her head. One heavy swing severed Ali's head from her neck and sent it flying towards Bryan as her body fell to the ground. As it landed, Ali's head turned face up, staring back at Bryan with soulless eyes as blood pooled out from the newly fashioned hole in her head. The suprise still shining brightly in her eyes. But that wasn't the only thing shining in her eyes. The full moon. Bryan felt his heart crunch, not sure if it was because the love of his life had just been murdered, or because his other self was crawling out to avenge her. The thing came stepping forward, Alison's blood dripping from her blade. His towering presence intimidating and haunting, his eyes even more dead then Alison's. Bryan's bones were aching and growing now, ripping through his clothes. His face morphed into a wolf's muzzle, his legs growing digitrade, fur growing all over. The thing simply watched with a dead gaze. After ten seconds, Bryan was gone and the beast stood in his place, foaming from the mouth. Dave stood in the doorway now, simply stared in shock, incapable of prossessing what the hell just happened. Bryan, or the thing that stood in Bryan's place, roared out loud at the moon so loud Dave's eardrums almost broke. The wolfman slowly turned around to face Dave. It still had Bryan's eyes, but had a feralness set to it. \"Boat. Run. \" , the wolfman growled through the foam and the rage shimmering beneath the fur and skin. It then charged the thing, and they both went fighting into the mist. Slashes, punches, ripping and roars filled the air as Dave made a run for the boat. He didn't even think about it. He couldn't think about it. He couldn't think. The friends that he grew up with, butchered like animals for slaughter. And then Ali. Oh God, Ali..... Dave threw what little stomach contents he had up on the dirt path. He was on his knees now, hands gripping the dirt where the soft rain of an hour ago had turned the dirt into mud. Ali was safe in these hands, and now she's gone. Her killer being fought off by Bryan. The wolfman. Both. Dave wanted to just lie down and die. He would never recover from this. He would spend the rest of his life in an insane asylum, strapped in a straightjacket and high on meds that would keep his mind numb while doctors would give him shock therapy and turn his brain to pulp. A howl, a dog's cry, a wolf's cry, filled the air. It was filled with pain and loss. Bryan. Suddenly, Dave didn't want to die. He got up and saw that the boat garage was only fifty feet away. He was so close to getting out alive. All he had to do was just walk in, get in the boat, turn it on, and get the fuck out, never to come back. Dave felt an inch of hope. He was going to make it. He basically sprinted inside the garage as fast as he could, his baggy clothes flopping around his limbs and body. The light popped since he was last here, only the moon shining on the water providing a source of light. The place smelled of blood and shit. Laura and Danny were probably still there. In the boat. He'd take them home and bury them. Dave rummaged around the shed, trying to find a light. He cut himself on some of the tools, but found a flashlight. after fumbling with his bleeding and and flicking the controls, cursing the fucking thing for not working, it turned on. Laura was still in the boat, a pool of blood formed around both her halves. Dave got closer, wondering what happened to Danny, as he felt something dripping on his head. Danny was hanging on the ceiling, tied by a chain around the neck on one of the horizontal support beams. His chest had a large hole, right where the heart should be. Dave forced himself to look away. He had no time. Bryan or that freak might be coming for him. He stuffed then flashlight in his mouth and looked around for the keys. They weren't in the ignition.

A large shape stood in the doorway. It's face was completely scarred and ripped, showing skull on several points, black blood seeping out of his left eye socket. Its flesh was grey and greenish, his chest exposed through ripped coveralls. It was bleeding so badly, Dave could see a stream of blood pouring out the several huge lashes on its flat belly. Its left arm had large holes in it, bite marks covered the limb. Its right leg had similair wounds, and his stance showed that he didn't favor it.

{"original_text": "Dieter rises from the bed, stumbling out of the sheets half-groggy from sleep over to the washstand in the corner. Pouring out a measure of water from the pitcher into the provided basin, he scrubs the dust from his eyes, scrubbing a washcloth behind his ears and neck. With a razor he grooms his closely cropped beard into order, careful not to slice his throat open with the deadly sharp blade. Finishing, he admires the keen look in the mirror, twisting and turning his head about to glance at his appearance. Storm gray eyes, a scar underneath the corner of the right from when a grenade exploded nearby. Another from a probing foe's stiletto. The scar tissue along his jaw well-healed. No wrinkles save those from scars or his career as a soldier. Dark brown hair just short of being shoulder length. Not a single gray hair anywhere on his head or in his beard. Ah. Dieter's heart sinks as the realization dawns on him.

Is something wrong?\" Comes the worried voice from the bed. He turns to her, a look of detachment in his storm gray eyes. Blank, as if he saw something a thousand yards away. \"How long has it been?\" He asks. Queen Malvina bolts upright from where she lays. \"Oh gods.\" She throws the covers off of her, a silk nightgown garbing her as she rushes to his side just before he collapses in her arms, his eyes staring off at some non-existent horizon. \"Dieter? Dieter, listen to me. Everything is alright.\" She turns her head to the closed door to their room. \"Sera! Fetch the doctors.\" Nodding at the servants voice affirming her orders, she returns her attention to her love. \"Shh, shh, it'll be alright. You're having a panic attack is all. Dieter? Dieter, look at me. Look, look..... look at me!\" That finally reaches him, causing him to jerk his head up at her, his eyes damp and full of fear. \"I can't die...\" He says, the statement not of disbelief but rather of terrible certainty. \"I won't age.\" Malvina holds tight to him, blinking away tears of her own. \"It'll pass, you're just having an attack. I've had them too. Everything will be fine, Dieter. Do you understand?\" She says, trying to believe her own words though it's plain enough to see that it isn't fine. \"Malvina, how long has it been?\" He asks, his voice practically begging for answer. \"Please, tell me.\" She closes her eye in shame, unable to look at him as she speaks. \"Eight years...\" She murmurs, self-loathing filling her breast as she stills his shaking hands. \"It's been eight years since I stole your mortality. I'm sorry Dieter, I'm so, so sorry.\" \"I'm not aging,\" Dieter repeats, his mind leagues away. \"I won't die. I can't die. I have to live with what I've done forever. I was supposed to die, I deserved to die.\" \"Dieter...\" Malvina says, her words at a loss. \"I hate you! I love you! You've taken everything from me, and given me everything!\" Malvina holds on to his attempted thrashing, pain and grief weakening him. Eventually he gives up, his head falling against her shoulder. \"I'm sorry, Malvina. It's just, it's She shushes him with a finger against his lips. \"It's alright, I understand. It's not easy. Trust me, I know. I spent a century alone, just myself immortal. It was painful. But it will get better.\" Dieter smiles at her comforting words, trying to trust them. \"What day is it?\" He asks. \"The 21st day of the second month. Why?\" A small smile crosses his lips. \"I'll be 36 in two weeks.\" His smile widens. \"And still the youngest person here.\" Both laugh softly at the joke, the door opening a few seconds later to reveal the form of her personal physician. \"We'd best make it a good one then.\" Malvina promises, kissing her love on the brow to seal it.", "text_perturb": "Dieter rises from the bed , stumbling out of the sheets half-groggy from sleep over to the washstand in the recession. Pouring out a measure of water from the pitcher into the provided basin , he scrub up the dust from his eyes , scrubbing a washcloth behind his ears and neck. With a razor he grooms his closely cropped beard into order , careful not to slice his throat loose with the deadly sharp blade. Finishing , he admires the great look in the mirror , twisting and turning his head about to glance at his appearance. Storm gray heart , a scar underneath the corner of the right from when a grenade exploded nearby. Another from a probing enemy 's stiletto. The scar tissue along his jaw well-healed. No wrinkles economise those from scars or his career as a soldier. Dark brown hair just short of being shoulder duration. Not a single gray hair anyplace on his head or in his beard. Ah.

{"original_text": "I walked a long dirt road back to a town I had visited just 3 weeks ago. As I approached the gate I was smiling, remembering what I had done here. Under orders of the king I had gone to a nearby cave and slew a horde of goblins. The king paid me handsomely, but the real reward was fighting for the people of this great kingdom. I knocked on the gate, but there was no answer. I waited a moment and then knocked again. Still nothing. I tried to pull open the door, and surprisingly it opened with no resistance. No locks? This seemed odd. My smile faded as I became curious about the situation that we now faced. The town seemed empty. As it was the late in the afternoon, this seemed very odd. Maybe there was a festival going on. Though that wouldn't explain why the gate's door was left unlocked. Determined to solve this mystery, I thought to confront the king and asked what was going on. The palace was also eerily silent. It almost seemed as if the entire town had just left all at once. The first sign of life was in the throne room. Or maybe \"sign of life\" was the wrong thing to call it. There was an ornately robed skeleton sitting on the throne, wearing the king's crown. Was it the king's skeleton? Perhaps. But how had the king died? The sun set, and simultaneously the skeleton seemed to come to life, blue flames filling out the bones. He turned his \"eyes\" to me. \"Ah. You have returned. How do you feel about the changes we've made?\" I was horrified. So the king was not dead? Suddenly skeleton soldiers entered the room and took to their stations. Though they had no skin, I could tell that they were just waking up. \"What happened here? What killed you all?\" The king laughed. \"Why, you did great warrior. Or at least, you helped us to achieve this goal. You see, I had been trying for years to unearth the secret to immortality, the lich's relic. But far too long there were monsters guarding it.

Anxious about fighting these monsters I pulled out my sword, but the closest skeleton grabbed my wrist and raised it for the crowd. \"Huzzah!\" they cried once again. They lifted me and set me in a highly decorated chair. Once I was settled they lifted the chair. They walked me out of the palace and then I saw the population of the town.

{"original_text": "[ ] (dropcap) The battle had dissolved into one seemingly endless melee, the ranks of both knight and commoner shoved together in a struggle of life and death, of fluttering banners and clashing steel, of dying men and beasts. Dinosaurs towered above the men and of horses, their scaly or feathered hides like bulwarks, their flanks peppered with arrows and crossbow bolts. Morions and halberds reared above, the three ton beasts trained to smash their way through the press of men whilst nosehorns such as the dangerous Triceratops carried wicker howdahs with archers, great lengths of padded armor and mail covering their massive sides. There was no planning, no strategy to the bloodshed. Each and every man fought for himself and for the man next to him, many fighting or dying by complete strangers; the organized companies and retinues had long dissolved in the chaos and instead groups of soldiers clustered around the banners of the nobles and of the captains, islands of refuge in a sea of madness and death. Above one of those great schiltrons flew a rampant Deinonychus in gold on a black field. And underneath the tightest cluster of banners stood a man wearing the same colors, an iron crown on the brow of his battered helm. He wore both bevor and visor, reducing his view of the chaotic scene to but a narrow slit. In his hands were a tired blade and shield, its leather covered face decorated with his heraldry. His brigandine was covered with scrapes and scratches, the snapped of length of crossbow hanging its hole in the leather surface. The small metal plates had done their duty in stopping the missile, turning a lethal shot into a merely heavy bruise. He was a mercenary captain, a proven leader of both man and beast, and a warrior without equal. Montador Samuel Hitch, the Black Captain. An enemy knight wearing red and white charged towards him, shouting the name of his house and of his allegiance. In his hands was a poleaxe, the five foot long weapon held high overhead. \"Aveluy!\" He shouted, slamming a lightly armored longbowman aside, lurching on the bloodsoaked mud. \"Iron, Cold Iron!\" Came the reply, the iron-crowned sellsword surging ahead with his chosen men-at-arms. A score of armored warriors formed a wedge, the bodies of enemy spearmen crashing against their shields like waves on a cliff. Swords stabbed at underarms and at joints in the enemy's armor whilst maces smashed plate and bone. \"Iron is master of men all!\" The red and white knight swung his polearm at Mor Samuel Hitch's head, but the veteran mercenary caught the armor piercing spike with a swipe of his shield. The deadly spike punched through the thick leather and wood, a half inch sticking out the back. Hitch swore and swung his shield to the side still with the poleaxe embedded in it, opening up his foe guard. In one blinding strike Hitch shoved the his blade at his foe's underarm, the narrow point puncturing the layer of mail and padding and slicing into his artery. The man groaned and fell, blood gushing from the wound as he dropped his weapon to clamp his hand over it. Hitch slammed his armored foot onto the man's chest and dented the thick plate as he used the dying man as a vantage point over the heads of the nearby soldiers. \"Hitch!\" Came the cry, somehow rising above the din of metal on metal and screaming men and beast. \"Hitch! You son of a whore! Fight! Fight me!\" Samuel Hitch turned his head, the narrow view slit forcing him to turn his whole torso and spied a small clump of men advancing through the melee, shoving their way forward with shield and sword. An older squire bore a small banner depicting silver dolphin a blue field and instantly Hitch's eyes narrowed. It was a emblem he knew well, having grown underneath it for the better part of his youth. The shouting man wore the golden spurs of a knight, his visor open to reveal a handsome face nearly the same as Hitch's, only younger and more cruel, and without the scars that the the latter earned on a score of battlefields. Mor Edwin Hitch, second born son of Baron Robert of Gosport snarled venom at his older sibling, leveling his blade at his bastard brother. \"Usurper!\" The younger brother shouted, bashing aside a enemy sergeant with his shield. \"Fay take you, Edwin!\" Samuel Hitch said, raising his visor as his half-brother neared. He had learned that his legitimate brother had been in the enemy host but he expected him to be in rearguard on the left flank of the battle. It certainly wasn't by chance that his brother found him. \"You searched for me?\" He asked. His brother Edwin got within ten paces and nodded, the battle nearest around them halting as both sides paused to watch. \"My father's been reaching news of your triumphs, been making noise of legitimatizing you. I can't have that.\" Hitch shook his head within his helm, silently cursing his younger brother. \"Creators, Ed. I don't want the barony. Tell our father that,\" he glanced about at the expectant crowd of soldiers and frowned. \"Alright, no one told you to stop fighting!\" \"I'm gon na kill you, Sam. Has to be done. \" \"Go fuck yourself, Ed. You were always a stupid piece of shit.\" With that he lowered his visor and raised his shield and sword, waiting for his younger half-brother to make the first move.

The months went by and I couldn't stop looking at her, I tried not to look but I kept wanting to. My eyes would scan the room and she would attract them to look at her, I couldn't help it, she was the first person I thought was beautiful in the whole world. Nobody could compare.

I realized that people do deserve a chance and in doing so I ended up giving another person a shot, somebody who liked me in a similar way to the way I liked her.

{"original_text": "\"I stand here before you as a meek servant of The Man With the Compassionate Horns,\" I cried. The men and women of the village stood still, nervously looking at one another. Slowly, a man began to nod. \"At last you've come!\" he said. He launched into an enthusiastic applause, soon followed by rapturous roars from the crowd. \"We have been awaiting your arrival.\" I felt a great relief. The dim-witted villagers tended to resist conversion, occasionally resorting to violence. My task was dangerous, but more so important. The Man With the Compassionate Horns had for years tried to assimilate dwellers of all the villages of the realm into his order. As of now, and since the dawn of time, chaos had been the dominant force of our existence. Tribal strifes and petty conflicts they were tearing the people apart. Trolls, elves, dwarfes, man; all were scattered and their alliances split. Finally, hope had come. As his chief Compassionate General, I was responsible for spreading the good word. I'd ventured into territory uncharted by man and seen savagery beyond description. I'd slain creatures unknown even to our finest scholars and converted soulless ghouls of the swamps. Now, there was hope. This tribe of mud apes welcomed me with open arms. \"I go by the name of Xerox,\" said the nodding man. \"I have been chosen as the King of the men of the Mire.\" \"Greetings, King Xerox,\" said I. \"I have travelled far and wide and would much appreciate a hot meal and a bed for the night.\" Xerox gave me a smile and a pat on the back. \"Least we could do for such a compassionate fellow.\" As I entered the King's hut, my heart was warmed. They had gone through the trouble of decorating in their simple ways, obviously in expectance of my arrival. Mud statues and filthy lanterns were arranged in intricate patterns. I made a mental note to enlighten our scholars that the mud people had developed a rudimentary form of craftsmanship. Perhaps we were not as different as was commonly thought. \"Feel free to employ the King's seat, as is befitting of a man of the Man With the Compassionate Horns.\" As he named my master, I could sense a certain unease among the mud dwellers. Surely, they were ashamed of their savageness being contrasted with the purity of a divine force. I understood. I, too, had loathed my heathen ways. Yet I was saved as I entered into His service, as these barbarians would soon be saved. I was given a flask of wine and what appeared to be bread. As I drank, it was if a great burden had been lifted off their collective shoulders. Relief is, after all, as pungent as the body odour of the dwarfes. Obviously, they were concerned I would reject their offerings. By partaking in their meal and drink, I was declaring us as equals. It was as if I could smell it. And it truly did smell of \" ..... dwarf?\" Before me stood a dwarfen creature, naked as they come. I did not understand. These were mud men. For centuries they had battled the dwarfes over game and territory. \"Aye, yes. Observant as well as compassionate, are we?\" \"As would be expected of the Beast's general,\" said a man with an Elvish accent. \"W-What is going on here?\" I said. I stood up, and stumbled. \"T-The wine, it's..... you have \"Poisoned it?\" said a creature with the guttural voice of the trolls. \"General is wise.\" I looked up, and saw the discordant assembly before me. Elf beside troll beside dwarf beside mud man. It was all too much. \"You will no longer attack and destroy the citizens of the realm. The terror of the Beast shall be no more.\" I looked up at Xerox. His eyes were afire with passion. \"His reign is over.

The men and women of the village stood still , nervously attend at one another. Slowly , a man began to nod. `` At last you 've total ! '' he said. He launched into an enthusiastic applause , soon followed by rapturous roars from the crew. `` We take in been awaiting your arrival. `` I sense a great relief. The dim-witted villagers tended to fend conversion , occasionally resorting to violence. My task was dangerous , but more thusly important. The Man With the Compassionate Horns suffer for years tried to assimilate dwellers of all the villages of the realm into his order. As of now , and since the dawn of time , chaos had been the dominant force of our world. Tribal strifes and petty conflicts they were deplumate the people apart. Trolls , elves , dwarfes , military personnel ; all were scattered and their alliances split. Finally , bob hope had come. As his chief Compassionate General , I was responsible for overspread the good word. I 'd ventured into territory uncharted by man and seen savagery beyond verbal description. I 'd slain brute unknown even to our finest scholars and converted soulless ghouls of the swamps. instantly , there was hope. This tribe of mud apes welcomed me with exposed arms. `` I go by the name of xerox machine , '' said the nodding man. `` I give birth been chosen as the King of the men of the Mire. `` `` Greetings , King Xerox , '' allege I. `` I have travelled far and wide and would a lot appreciate a hot meal and a bed for the night. `` Xerox fall in me a smile and a pat on the back. `` Least we could do for such a compassionate fellow. `` As I record the King 's hut , my heart was warmed. They had gone through the trouble of decorating in their simple ways , obviously in expectance of my reaching. Mud statues and filthy lanterns cost arranged in intricate patterns. I made a mental note to enlighten our scholars that the mud multitude had developed a rudimentary form of craftsmanship. Perhaps we were not as different as follow commonly thought. `` Feel free to employ the King 's seat , as is befitting of a man of the Man With the Compassionate cornet. `` As he named my master , I could sense a certain unease among the mud indweller. Surely , they were ashamed of their savageness embody contrasted with the purity of a divine force. I realize. I , too , make loathed my heathen ways. Yet I was saved as I entered into His service , as these barbarians would presently be saved. I was given a flask of wine colored and what appeared to be bread. As I salute , it was if a great burden had been lifted off their collective shoulders. Relief is , after all , equally pungent as the body odour of the dwarfes. Obviously , they were concerned I would reject their offerings. By partaking in their meal and drink , I was declaring us as equal. It was as if I could smell it.

They take it so seriously \"sir would you like to order more strawberry banana its our best seller.\" Hell one of them even made a PowerPoint brought it to me explaining why we should sell some mint tea flavor\" like I give a crap. I threw ten grand at him and told him to take care of it. I found out later though he skimmed two grand and spent it on himself only buying eight grand of yogurt. back if I was still up to my old ways, I would have sliced off his eye lids with a fillet knife. Then gave him a Colombian neck tie. that way upon death he looks like a smiley emoticon. that was my signature way of killing when it was personal. But I retired, Gina convinced me that I had enough money, and I could go legitimate and give up my wicked ways. See he was the only one who knew my true profession, everyone else thought I was a banker. I had confessed it one day to her while I was drunk at her apartment. I would have killed her the next day as she is now a liability, yet I couldnt. I dont know why? at this point I had eight kills under my belt but I couldnt do this one. We didnt talk for awhile after that. until about a month later After I murdered a senators daughter so he would sign the bill in fear of his other loved ones. that hit hard. I went into every bar I could find and drink life away. I was about to confess to the bartender when suddenly I feel I tug on my ear. It was Gina. This girl had the balls to drag me by the ear like she was an old nun. she had seen my jag in the lot and came rushing in as she knows I only drink when upset. later when I sobered up I realized she saved my life, I also realized for the first time in my life I was in love. From then on we would see each other about once a month. and meet at this frozen yogurt place. she loved it. It was called Ken and Jeff's frozen scoops maybe youve heard of it? always sounded rather fruity to me, and not in the they have the finest selection of fresh fruit to put on top of their wide selection of yogurt. Time goes on she gets married to this guy named Todd. pssh Todd can you believe it. Fuck this guy! but she likes him so I put up with him. about a year later they get engaged to Fucking Todd. She told him what I did after one night in bed..... yeah that part infuriated me too. in bed! I still have a sinking feeling thinking about it. Any way this tool comes up to me in a trench coat and shades with a case full of money. He actually used newspaper and ones to fill the case under a row of hundreds. he thinks this is some fucking movie! so I humor him, like many people he wants his boss dead. normally I make people take 48 hours to think about it and make sure. instead I hand him an unregistered gun and tell him to do it himself. I told him the client needed to have blood on their hands before they can hire me. Circle of trust and all that. He actually fell for it. so after that I began to like this putz. he had me do miscellaneous jobs, scare some people break a few legs etc..... and while he was out doing \"reconnaissance work\" or at his day job id be banging his fiance. Deeply hoping Gina would leave him and love me. But in august she married him. I didnt show to the wedding knowing id object. feeling defeated in life I lost passion for killing, the adrenaline before the kill. the success of knowing im in control as the light leaves their eyes. then the unfortunate guilt and questioning of myself at night. I became an entrepreneur selling frozen yogurt at my new chain. Extreme Freeze. I opened it for her. well one day this cocksucker comes up to me. He has found a used rubber on the ground. He knew she was cheating but didnt know who. He hires me to find him. I told him I went legit but he begged and pleaded right in the mall. I just said sure to get him to go away. but He expects to see a body now. MY BODY Only he doesnt know that yet. Todd also doesn't know he just paid to have himself killed.
