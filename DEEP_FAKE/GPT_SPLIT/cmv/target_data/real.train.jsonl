{"original_text": "I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is massively misrepresented as mediocre among fellow fans and otakus. Currently ranked [459 on MAL] , this show scores an average rating of only 8 out of 10 nerd points. I believe this is due primarily to hater votes. It should be in the top 50, if not top 25, anime of all time. In fairness to the haters, the ALO arcs sort of ruined it with the whole sister romance harem thing. Japanese people are weird, but they sure know how to milk a hit show. For that reason, SAO II is not considered here; just vanilla SAO please! Some Background I am a 30-year old male product writer for the web, and I am not what most would consider an otaku or weeabo. (I prefer Korean culture, if we're comparing asking, and I don't go to cons, collect or read much Manga, or follow every anime series.) I watch anime recreationally, and consider myself a reasonable self-styled critic. I've recently watched quite a number of shows, being bored at home, and I've watched and rewatched SAO several times and am familiar with it. Why The Show Is Good Characters: The cast is great. Voice acting isn't overdone or underdone, and the characters all feel like people from a real world stuck in a game for a long time together. It also makes sense that they're all there. Plot: The premise is not made of solid gold, but it's interesting enough to lend itself to greatness. If you die in the game, you die for real no quitsies. This has been done before in fiction, of course. However, SAO takes a different treatment of this premise. Normally, you would see horror, like in a show like Gantz, applied, or game aspects, such as in No Game No Life. SAO's goal is rather to show that a virtual world can be real and fulfilling. Its creators accomplish this by focusing not on the MMO aspects, which are limited to flavor, but rather on the interaction between strong characters and the tension of being trapped within this scary world. The story itself lends itself to a rich world, and the writers take advantage of the larger arc to fit in almost a dozen sub-arcs in 24 episodes. The show is very story dense for an anime; normally, a single sub-arc would take 4-6 episodes. These sub-arcs balance developing the world, fighting, and building relationships. The characters build on their strengths and flaws and often find themselves in situations partially crafted of their own making. (Example; Asuna is hard on her guild and pushy, and this results in a poor culture within the guild that causes problems as the series develops.) There are no unbelievable moments. In the end, the heroes triumph, but it's not a boring triumph. They often sacrifice during the show and make many mistakes that weigh upon them. At the ending bar scene, you can feel the air of both relief and regret washing over all of the former players. At the symbolic level, SAO is very symbolic of life itself. God puts us on this plant, and we don't get to leave unless we die. So we adapt to it and live in it, the same as in SAO's virtual world. This allegoric story pairs well with the show's many slice-of-life scenes, creating a very vibrant and real-seeming virtual world. Writing: SAO does not waste time or words. No episode is filler, and each main character is multi-dimensional and arrives naturally in the main story arc. Characters do not break character. Villains are villains. Episodes are succinct and excellently paced. This show is so clean that you can eat off of it. Art: The art direction is superb. Each character's outfit is suitable for their personality and status. Motion and combat is more fluid and direct as well as it was in Fate: UBW and other highly regarded similar shows. It was smoother than classic epics like Record of Lodoss War and Gurren Lagann or modern releases like Arslan. Admittedly, it probably had a bigger budget than those shows, but that shouldn't be a detracting factor at all. The only fantasy world anime I would give a higher regard to in art direction is Berserk, but in quality of animation, SAO crushes Berserk. The only complaint you could make in the art department is that the show wasn't stylized enough to differentiate it from other fantasy anime. For instance, the art direction in Kill la Kill was an incredible thematic rush of color with awesome hand-painted backgrounds. I'll grant that point, but can you name a fantasy anime with a better quality of animation offhand? Avoids Most Awful Anime Pitfalls: Fanservice, chibi conversations, people falling off of park benches or turning into paper; these are the marks of an anime breaking the fourth wall and ruining suspension of disbelief for the view. In short, they're signs that an anime doesn't take itself seriously. Almost no anime of any level of notoriety, excluding comedies, uses these generic tactics. Arguments Against Overpowered Main Character The story follows Kirito, a regular guy with some Kendo training and beta test experience in an online game. Kirito earns almost all of his levels solo and is on par with the very best fighters in the game. He starts off with an advantage due to his experience, gets full exp. for the very first boss, and grinds pretty much every day from there on out to stay on top of the curve. He clearly earns his main character slot through a number of trials instead of being handed it by the divine will of the writers, such as in every other anime ever. He is given a unique skill, eventually, which is powerful, but it's relatively balanced because it's difficult to use. His backstory and skillset are reasonable, and given that there must be a \"best\" among all the players, it makes sense that the show would follow him. Meanwhile, in How to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, the main character is literally given a skill that says \"become overpowered against things you can't beat.\" It's shit like that which makes me want to throw my laptop. Dumb Plot Moments In the first or second episode, another beta tester dies in Kirito's arms not because he was defeated, but because he turned down a potion. That guy was obviously a fuckin' idiot, and that scene could have been saved if he had just drank up and laid there. This is a fair criticism. Additionally, the army guild unit that marches in to fight the minotaur boss half dead is also made of retards. However, it's noted in the show that the reason they do this is because the army has been terrorizing its members. However, those deaths serve a purpose within the show and are not overtly distracting. The dumb beta guy's death serves to inspire Kirito to action and turns him into the MC. The dumb army guys are, much like the group that runs into the trap room early in the series, there to set Kirito on the right path and force him into action. In the meantime, how will you excuse characters like Faye Valentine in one of your favorite anime, Cowboy Bebop? She's just there to be a plot instigator with a pair of giant boobs. Almost. Entirely. Fanservice. Many other very good anime have done much much worse with their cast and still rank top 50. Hell, Hajime no Ippo is fan ranked 20 on MAL, and although I won't disagree that the show is awesome, it's just following the formula of a hundred other sports anime shows like Prince of Tennis. OWARI NO SERAPH is even up there, and that show literally only has one redeeming character who isn't in most episodes. Hell, characters are invented out of thin air and people do dumb shit in Game of Thrones every other episode. Are you really going to say that SAO's weak point is a few serviceable plot blunders and side characters that didn't think through some obvious mistakes? You didn't like the ending The ending probably irked a few of people because it was so sudden. However, that's really the magic of the series. It's a virtual world controlled by a nutty, manipulative scientist-god whose purposes are unknown. That's the driving mystery behind every episode. Why are they even there? Why is the NPC planted in the guild as the final boss? Why is the psychologist AI disabled? Without that underlying tension, the series doesn't take shape. The story is about human actors making intense decisions, and the elusive creator adds another layer to the conflict. It makes the story feel bigger than it is and every victory seem hollow. This in turn allows our main characters to keep driving forward. Plus, they've already put in so many boss fights. I thought the defeat of the technically invincible guild leader was an awesome way to end, although it's obviously hedging a sequel. I'm tired of typing, so I won't bore you with more examples. Although I really wish they had done much more with the sequels, I believe the original series ranks among the best-produced, best scripted, cleanest, most heartfelt Anime of all time. I look forward to your spirited replies. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"original_text": "In New Zealand between the last two elections there was a significant increase in funding pushing for a better voting turnout. For many years now they have made it compulsory to register, however measures such as these seem to be highly ineffective globally at getting an increased turnout in elections, not just NZ. There was less than a 5 increase in voting in the last election despite it being a far more prominent election due to the kim dot com saga. National, our right wing party won so promisingly they were able to not form a coalition with other groups (this is almost unheard of in NZ). Many of my peers did not vote, nor did I as we believed that john key was a poor choice for a leader, but there was a lack of any leader that appealed to this group of 10 of us.

In the book. Watney establishes contact with NASA by driving over to the Sojurner rover and stealingfixing it to transmit to Earth (which...awesome).

It would be the President of the United States making the ultimate decision to greenlight projects. And at that level, it seems very unlikely that they'd get the greenlight. The independence of NASA in the book is greatly at odds with how I see government agencies working. The Chinese government would not give a large booster over to NASA like they did. This is portrayed as happening at the agency level coordinating with the Chinese space agency and then presenting it to political leaders as a fait accompli.

And the Hermes mutiny to force the government's hand just seems absurdly implausible to me.

{"original_text": "In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the 'slippery slope' argument that it's legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I'm not interested in arguing whether or not this will happen, but why it would be a bad thing if it did. This would be within the context of people being allowed to have multiple marriages, you would not automatically be married to your spouse's other spouse, although you could choose to do this. While I personally am not interested in polygamy, what's wrong with it? It's natural for humans to live in groups.'Tribes' or'family' whatever you would like to call it. I don't see anything wrong with families that have several adults to act as role models for children. I just can't see why it would be detrimental to children to be raised in that environment. To be allowed to marry you need to be a consenting adult and in being one people can make their own relationship decisions. As long as there isn't a sex bias (e.g. men can have many wives but not the other way around), then I think that people can make their own decision about whether a polygamous relationship is something they want. They retain the right to get divorced if their spouse marries someone else when they want a monogamous marriage, just like people retain the right to get a divorce if their spouse cheats on them. People sometimes argue against polygamous marriages saying that people are already legally allowed to have polygamous relationships, why get married? Because of the legal privileges associated with it? When I get married the legal benefits of being married are going to be way down on the list of reasons. Getting married is a way to show your love for someone. A big argument going against it is that the legality of it would be very complex. I don't think that's necessarily the case. If you died your possessions would be divided up amongst your spouses. Your children would either go to their other parent or be claimed by a next of kin who wants them, with fitness to look after them being determined by a court of law. As is the case currently with children whose parents die without leaving a will e.g. should they go to uncle A or uncle B? There are lots of examples of legal contracts which are binding to groups of people, why couldn't this be applied to marriage? It could be encouraged, or even possibly mandatory, to have pre-nuptial agreements which define legal aspects of the marriage relating to property ownership, etc. prior to getting married if you're married to more than one person. With current spouses also signing this document. I'm not really that interested in ethical arguments. Why should one person's ethics determine how other people live their lives? For example, I don't think I would ever have an abortion for my own personal ethical reasons. That doesn't mean that I'm against other people having the option. I'm really interested to know if anyone has any good arguments against polygamous marriages. I think a lot of people are against them for their own personal ethical reasons, because they don't want one themselves, rather than for an actually good, justifiable reason. So please try to CMV! I'm going to try to reply to every direct response to me. I get really ped off when people cherry-pick arguments and ignore the ones that don't suit them. If there are a lot of responses it may take a while though so please be patient! But in saying that if you reply purely because I've committed to responding; if you put forth a low-effort comment you will get a low-effort answer.

Edit2: Right, there's a fair few replies so I will be going through them. Although a lot of later comments are using arguments that have been used before I'm still determined to reply to all of them.

Apologies to anyone whose comment I missed, but thank you all for being part of the conversation. It was very entertaining and I definitely feel a lot more informed. So you don't have to scroll down find the explanation for my delta, I'll give it here: \"While I still think there is nothing wrong with polygamous relationships the concept of some sort of legal commitment, this couldn't be marriage. You could have some kind of legally binding partnership with multiple partners which has some of the benefits of marriage, such as recognition of the partnership affecting things like visitation rights and a legal claim to be next of kin, but this wouldn't be the same as marriage as we have it now. It's not so much about when people in the marriage are living together, but if things later needed to be taken apart. There is just no way to predict every possibility for a pre-nuptial agreement, and the situation could get so complex that you couldn't have a standard that could be fallen back on every time.\" Hello, users of CMV!

So you do n't have to scroll down find the explanation for my delta , I 'll give it here : `` While I still recall there is nothing wrong with polygamous relationships the concept of some sort of legal commitment , this could n't be marriage. You could throw some kind of legally binding partnership with multiple partners which has some of the benefits of marriage , such as recognition of the partnership affecting things like visitation rights and a legal claim to be next of kin , but this would n't be the same as marriage as we throw it now. It 's not so much about when mass in the marriage are living together , but if things later needed to be taken apart. There is just no way to predict every possibility for a pre-nuptial agreement , and the situation could get indeed complex that you could n't have a standard that could be fallen back on every time. `` how do you do , users of CMV !

Specifically addressed by the first amendment, the Supreme Court must address political speech with high scrutiny. This does not mean that political speech cannot be regulated at all; it just means that it must be regulated very carefully. Various types of speech are regulated, including: When the speech creates \"clear and present danger\" o Example: Yelling \"FIRE!\" in a movie theatre.

It is the Supreme Court's job to \"interpret\" the constitution, determining what types of speech can and cannot be regulated. In the case of Citizens United v.

CU gave wealthy individuals (including corporations) the ability to use unlimited funds for political speech. This type of speech has promoted a situation in which the wealthy have the ability to manipulate legislation to benefit themselves financially, often thwarting innovation while promoting unfair tax codes and income inequality.

One of the only compelling arguments for why CU was right is the \"lesser of two evils\" argument stating that allowing all forms of political speech that require money is better than allowing none.

{"original_text": "So I'm not sure how many of you guys are aware of the recent events in the MtG world but today a professional player, Zach Jesse, was banned presumably because of his past criminal history which includes a sexual assault guilty plea when he was 19. I'm not aware of the exact circumstances surrounding his offense. What unsettles me about the ban is that it seems to have occurred because another player, Drew Levin, pointed out Jesse's criminal past with a Twitter post: Quick reminder: Zach Jesse is a literal rapist who got away with serving three months of an eight year plea deal.\" It should be noted that this is a very speculative and misleading statement, as the public is not aware of the details surrounding his plea. Wizards of the Coast gave a short statement saying that the reasoning behind the ban was to ensure that players feel safe at events. Obviously a worthy endeavor, but I don't see how it really applies here. We are talking about large events at convention centers with thousands of people, security, etc. If, in the eyes of the law, he is not considered a threat to the public (i.e. not in jail) then how can Wizards see him as one? And what's the point in attempting to rehabilitate criminals if they are to be forever shunned from participating even in large public events? It's not like the guy is applying for a teaching job at an elementary school or something. They even banned him from online play. Lastly, I do not think Wizards should have taken this action based on a Twitter witch-hunt that was started by another player. If they want to have a universal no criminal record policy at all of their events, then maybe it would be justified. But to selectively ban one person because he was villified on a social media site is pretty unreasonable, IMO. I want to hear people's thoughts on this because it seems like the rmagictcg community is vehemently opposed to the ban. I'd like to hear some outside opinion's. The SRS crowd seems to support the ban, calling rmagictcg a bunch of rape apologists, etc, but then again the SRS crowd is not very logical or reasonable. So I'd like to hear what you all think. CMV, Edit: If anyone can provide a source that he was convicted of rape, I will award you a delta. Edit: So my view has been changed due to new information I have been made aware of regarding the details of Jesse's crime. Anally raping an unconscious girl over a toilet is pretty despicable, I had no idea his offense was even close to that magnitude. Thanks everyone who responded here.

Happy CMVing!", "text_perturb": "So I 'm not sure how many of you guys are aware of the recent events in the MtG world but today a professional player , Zach Jesse , was banned presumptively because of his past criminal history which includes a sexual assault guilty plea when he was 19. I 'm not aware of the exact consideration surrounding his offense. What unsettles me about the ban is that it seems to have occurred because another player , Drew Levin , pointed out Jesse 's criminal past with a Twitter post : Quick reminder : Zach Jesse is a literal rapist who got away with serving three months of an eight year plea flock. `` It should be noted that this is a very notional and misleading statement , as the public is not aware of the details surrounding his plea. Wizards of the Coast gave a short statement saying that the reasoning behind the ban was to see that players feel safe at events. Obviously a worthy endeavor , but I do n't see how it really applies hither. We are peach about large events at convention centers with thousands of people , security , etc. If , in the eyes of the law , he is not considered a threat to the public ( . due east. not in jail ) then how can Wizards see him as one ? And what 's the point in attempting to rehabilitate criminals if they are to be forever shunned from participating even in large public events ? It 's not like the guy is applying for a teaching book of job at an elementary school or something. They even banned him from online caper. Lastly , I do not think Wizards should feature taken this action based on a Twitter witch-hunt that was started by another player. If they want to have a universal no criminal record policy at all of their events , and then maybe it would be justified. But to selectively ban one person because he equal villified on a social media site is pretty unreasonable , IMO. I want to hear people 's thought on this because it seems like the rmagictcg community is vehemently opposed to the ban. I 'd like to hear some outside judgment 's. The SRS crowd seems to support the ban , calling rmagictcg a bunch of colza apologists , etc , but then again the SRS crowd is not very logical or reasonable. So I 'd like to take heed what you all think. cmv , Edit : If anyone can provide a source that he was convicted of rape , I will award you a delta. Edit : So my view has been changed due to new entropy I have been made aware of regarding the details of Jesse 's crime. Anally raping an unconscious girl over a potty is pretty despicable , I had no idea his offense was even close to that magnitude. Thanks everyone who responded hither.

Thank you all!:) In 7th and 8th grade I was a snob. This was probably because I am the youngest of five siblings and was fairly better looking than my classmates (before the acne, bad eyesight and crooked teeth kicked in) among other things. I realised this because of the way my classmates talked about me and treated me and I took the summer of 8th grade to transform into somebody else. I do not recall how exactly I did it but I did. Everybody was surprised, myself included, that the transformation was permanent and genuine. Sadly, I was no longer a bitch but a pushover instead. I was bullied shortly after and had a horrible 8 or so years until I graduated from university. During those 8 or so years, my first love died in a car crash, my parents had a terrible accident leaving my mother unable to walk for a year, of course I picked up smoking, I started to serial-date guys and their treatment to me kept getting progressively worse all while I tried to do well at university because it was getting too expensive for my parents to pay for and getting a job wasn't enough for me to sustain myself.

I did things I never thought I'd do and was put in situations I never wanted to be placed in. I was even ashamed of my own psychologist whom I never went back to visit after a couple of sessions because of how fucked up I was.

My POINT is: How can I, and so many people who have gone through worse, emerge as functional if not even better people than we were because of what we went through by using our own logic and reasoning, the help of others, counselling and other resources, while others simply act as if life is supposed to be somehow tailored for them and that whatever'triggers' them by making them actually have to THINK about what they went through should somehow be erased from their lives?

{"original_text": "Final Edit: Thank you to everyone who contributed to this discussion! I'm pleased with how it went and the back and forth was impressively civil. Kudos! I awarded two deltas: one disputing my included claim that bicycles are more capable of maneuvering a rolling stop than cars, and one for a caveat that municipalities should have the option of restricting the law in certain zones where the dangers would outweigh the benefits. Continue the conversation! I'm ready for bed. This has been argued before, but the most recent iteration I could find was two months ago and I believe because: 1. it is part of a major national ongoing discussion in transportation circles, and 2. the post of two months ago used different reasoning than my own, It is worth revisiting Background: Idaho Statute 49-720, commonly known as the \"Idaho Stop Law\" or \"Idaho Yield Law\" is legislation allowing legal exemptions from stop signs and stop lights for people riding bicycles that was adopted in 1982. The full law can be read [here] for those interested. Paraphrased, the law states that any bicyclist approaching a stop sign must slow their speed and check for cross traffic, but may proceed without stopping if it is safe to do so. Additionally, bicyclists approaching a stop light must come to a full stop (defined as a \"halt of forward momentum and may proceed through the light forward or by turning onto a cross street in either direction if it is safe to do so and the bicyclist does not impede cross traffic. My reasoning: Having lived in Idaho (among many other places both densely urban and vastly rural) and having used a bicycle as my primary means of transportation for nearly 20 years in those areas, I believe the Idaho Stop, if implemented correctly, is not only the best compromise for all forms of traffic that share the roads, but is actually beneficial to all road users. There are many reasons the law is beneficial to cyclists, from their perspective (taken from [wikipedia]: Because of the positive externalities of cycling, bicycle laws should be designed to allow cyclists to travel swiftly and easily, and this provision allows for the conservation of energy. Current laws were written for cars, and unlike cars, it is easy for cyclists to yield the right-of-way without coming to a complete stop. Because cyclists are moving slower, have stereoscopic hearing, have no blind spots and can stop and maneuver more quickly than cars, current traffic control device laws don't make sense for cyclists. With the Idaho stop, at special intersections where lights are controlled by sensing equipment, there is no need to provide extra equipment for cyclists. (This is a big problem) The usual law forces cyclists to choose between routes that are more efficient but less safe due to higher traffic volumes, and routes that are safer, but less efficient due to the presence of numerous stop signs. Allowing cyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs empowers them to legally make the safer routes more efficient. These are all logical benefits to the cyclist. As such, they should be taken into account when making decisions regarding traffic infrastructure improvements. However, give the overwhelming task of replacingimproving infrastructure long since built primarily for motor vehicles, cyclists of my generation and probably the following as well require some compromises to be able to use the streets safely and efficiently as legal vehicles (yes, bikes are considered vehicles every bit as much as cars in every state.) That said, I believe the strongest two arguments for why the Idaho Stop makes sense right now is not the benefit it provides to the cyclist exclusively, but the benefit it is to traffic flow in general. 1. Allowing bicyclists to proceed through intersections during red lights or at stop signs when it is safe to do so greatly reduces the number of bicycle riders who slow the flow of traffic through intersections. 2. By allowing cyclist to get in front of traffic, they become more visible, and in so doing, safer. The Idaho Stop allows bicycles to remove themselves from the acceleration phase of a traffic cycle, when the speed discrepancy is highest between bicycles and motor vehicles, while simultaneously allowing the cyclist as a small, slow moving vehicle to move to the front of traffic making them more visible to all road users. [The only study done on the topic in Idaho] (pdf warning) found the latter claim to be true as the number of injuries to bicycle riders in the year after implementation dropped by 14.5, with no increase in fatalities. As for the traffic flow improvement claim, I have nothing to offer other than anecdotal evidence from myself and fellow cyclists who have practiced the law. I would be open to reading any studies demonstrating evidence to the contrary if they exist. Conclusion: Ultimately, I believe the best solution for all parties is separated infrastructure for cyclists akin to what is found in the Netherlands and other bicycle-friendly European countries, such as protected bike lanes, cycletracks, and protected intersections. Many jurisdictions in the U.S.A. are moving toward implementing these necessary improvements, but timelines for such a massive restructuring of traffic flow and accompanying reeducation period stretch on, quite literally, for a lifetime. Timeline projects for some projects are on the scale of 50 years. In the meantime, I believe people who chose to ride bicycles for practical purposes ought to be encouraged and protected in doing so and the Idaho Stop Law is the best example of a working compromise available while we continue to work toward a more permanent solution. I feel strongly about this argument and have spent years debating it, but I am always open to having my view changed if the right argument arises that I haven't considered. CMV? EDIT 1: A huge caveat required to make this practical is a strong educational program to accompany the law change wherever it is affected. Schools, news organizations, government agencies, and police would have to cooperate to educated all road users about the change. It is happening in Boise right now, and can be done. EDIT 2: A good number of responses are arguing that bicyclists already break laws and this would make them more likely. Contrarily, what has been seen in Boise is that with the advent of the law, police are free to ignore bicyclists behaving in law-abiding and safe manner, and freed up to target those who are actually putting others in danger. There is nothing inherent in the law that legalizes hitting pedestrians or cutting off cross traffic, and violators who do that can more easily be identified and appropriately cited.

The Idaho Stop allows bicycles to remove themselves from the acceleration phase of a traffic cycle , when the speed divergence is highest between bicycles and motor vehicles , while simultaneously allowing the cyclist as a small , slow moving vehicle to move to the front of traffic making them more visible to all road users. [ The only study done on the topic in Idaho ] ( pdf warning ) found the latter claim to be true as the number of injuries to cycle riders in the year after implementation dropped by 14. 5 , with no increment in fatalities. As for the traffic flow improvement title , I have nothing to offer other than anecdotal evidence from myself and fellow cyclists who have practiced the law. I would represent open to reading any studies demonstrating evidence to the contrary if they exist. Conclusion : Ultimately , I believe the best solution for all parties is separated infrastructure for cyclists akin to what is found in the Netherlands and other bicycle-friendly European countries , such as protected bike lanes , cycletracks , and protected crossway. many jurisdictions in the U. siemens. A. are moving toward implementing these necessary melioration , but timelines for such a massive restructuring of traffic flow and accompanying reeducation period stretch on , quite literally , for a lifetime. Timeline undertaking for some undertaking are on the scale of 50 years. In the meantime , I believe people who chose to ride bicycles for practical purposes ought to be encouraged and protected in doing so and the Idaho Stop Law is the best example of a working compromise useable while we continue to work toward a more permanent solution. I feel strongly about this argument and have spent years debating it , but I am always open to having my vista changed if the right argument arises that I have n't considered. CMV ? EDIT 1 : A huge caveat required to make this practical is a strong educational programme to accompany the law change wherever it is affected. Schools , news organizations , government agencies , and constabulary would have to cooperate to educated all road users about the change. It is hap in Boise right now , and can be done. EDIT 2 : A good number of responses are arguing that bicyclists already break laws and this would make them more probable. Contrarily , what has been seen in Boise is that with the advent of the law , police are free to dismiss bicyclists behaving in law-abiding and safe manner , and freed up to target those who are actually putting others in danger. There is nothing inherent in the law that legalizes hitting pedestrians or cutting off cross dealings , and violators who do that can more easily be identified and appropriately cited.

{"original_text": "From Mike Rowe's recent AMA to posts on rpersonalfinance, I see more and more redditors advising their peers to forego college and pursue a certification in a trade. I think this is generally bad advice: not because I think that no one should go into the skilled trades, but because 1.) I think most people aren't cut out for a trade career, and 2.) the stable income one can earn as a skilled tradesman is maintained by the scarcity of skilled tradesmen. To expand: Skilled trade jobs are hard, physical work: I come from a family of roofers, and live in an area that has been experiencing constant new home construction since the early '90s. My father was a satellite TV installer back when a satellite dish would take up most of your back yard, and a TVtelephone installer after that. Most of my (older) family members have had major knee, back, and hip surgeries in their 40s and 50s, and many have sustained life-altering or career-ending injuries. Physically, I would never have been able to pursue a career in the 'family business' (I'm a skinny dude), and I think it's better to work 40 years and retire with your body mostly intact than work 25-30 years and retire because you've destroyed your body and physically can't work any more. It's going to be a long time (possibly never) until skilled trades are 'respected'. I'm sure many people don't care how society views their career, and would laugh in the face of someone who denigrates their job while making substantially less money. That said: there will always be some people who look down on the 'dirty jobs', and some people who avoid those jobs because of it. I don't think income level alone will be enough to legitimize certain careers at certain levels of society. I'm not saying it's right: I'm saying it's a reality. Some people will always balk at marrying a sewage technician, even if that sewage technician is making 100k. (The Big One) The only reason the skilled trades are well-paid is because they are scarce. We will always need contractors, plumbers, electricians, and welders; but we only need so many. In the '70s, everyone was advising young people to go into medicine. In the '80s, everyone was advising young people to go into law. In the '90s, everyone was advising young people to go into technology and computers. Look at the job prospects of those fields today. Medicine is still well-paid, but only because it takes a decade (and hundreds of thousands of dollars) to become a doctor. Starting lawyers are earning 40k, after accruing 100k in law school debt. Information Technology grads have a higher unemployment rate than Theater or English majors. Any field that experiences a rapid influx of credentialed professionals suffers from depressed wages and high unemployment. If young people take the oft-proffered advice and enter the skilled trades: their experience is going to be worse. It takes much less time, money, and (please don't be mad at me for saying so) intellectual rigor to become certified as a skilled tradesman than it does to become a doctor, lawyer, or computer scientist. By the same token ... Wages and working conditions in the skilled trades have been protected by unionization, which is ever-diminishing. The trajectory of unions in the US has been sad and getting sadder for decades. Unions are the weakest today that they've been since before the Gilded Age. An influx of newly credentialed tradesmen, desperate for work in an increasingly saturated market, will lead to fewer union-affiliated workers. As union membership decreases, wages will fall. With Right-to-Work laws in a majority of US states, unions will lose power and skilled trade jobs will go to the lowest bidders - skilled trades will no longer provide a middle-class income. A college degree is still a worthwhile investment. Statistically, a college degree is worth somewhere between 800k to 1.2m over the course of a working career. Even if a student takes out 32k in loans (the average for a college graduate), that investment returns many, many times over the course of a career. An investment that provides a very real monetary return while affording the graduate a less physically-demanding career with greater social recognition seems like a good investment to me. Today, as it stands, few people enter the skilled trades because they are physically difficult and because they don't garner the level of social respect that the so-called 'white collar' careers attain. For the people who still choose the skilled trades - this is good news. It means that their wages are better and they can use their scarcity of labor to control their pay and working conditions. Further, it means that young people who are inherently suited for the skilled trades (because of family background, physical prowess, andor difficulty with traditional education) have the opportunity to earn a comfortable living in a skilled trade. Encouraging many people who wouldn't have considered entering the skilled trades on their own volition to make that choice will depress wages and discourage those who could have earned a university degree (which would have been a better investment) to enter a lower-paying and more physically-destructive career. Skilled tradesmen are benefitting from the scarcity of employees in their fields. Let's allow them to keep that scarcity, encourage those who can excel in college to pursue a degree, and encourage everyone to pursue the field that best suits their abilities: not the one that will earn the most money.

An influx of newly credentialed tradesmen , desperate for work in an more and more saturated market , will lead to fewer union-affiliated workers. As union membership decreases , wages will light. With Right-to-Work laws in a majority of US states , unions will lose power and skilled trade jobs will go to the lowest bidders - skilled trades will no more longer provide a middle-class income. A college degree is still a worthwhile investment. Statistically , a college degree personify worth somewhere between 800k to 1. 2m over the track of a working career. Even if a student takes out 32k in loan ( the average for a college graduate ) , that investment returns many , many times over the course of a career. An investment that provides a very real monetary return while affording the graduate a less physically-demanding career with greater social recognition seems like a safe investment to me. Today , as it stands , few people enter the skilled trades because they are physically difficult and because they do n't garner the level of societal respect that the so-called 'white collar ' careers attain. For the people who even choose the skilled trades - this is good news. It means that their wages are better and they can use their scarcity of labor to control their salary and working conditions. Further , it means that young people who are inherently suited for the skilled trades ( because of fellowship background , physical prowess , andor difficulty with traditional education ) have the opportunity to earn a comfortable living in a skilled trade. Encouraging many people who would n't have considered entering the skilled trades on their own volition to make that choice will depress wages and discourage those who could have earned a university degree ( which would have been a better investment ) to enrol a lower-paying and more physically-destructive career. Skilled tradesmen exist benefitting from the scarcity of employees in their fields. Let 's allow them to keep that scarcity , encourage those who can excel in college to pursue a degree , and encourage everyone to pursue the field that unspoiled suits their abilities : not the one that will earn the most money.

{"original_text": "Hey all! I'm talking about the really big unions, with hundreds or thousands of local groups and up to hundreds of thousands of members. I'm emphatically not talking about small, independent unions formed to fight for workers. The impression I've gotten from media coverage is that large unions have a few principal problems that combine to make rather unhelpful organizations: Large unions tend, from what I've seen, to have a leadership clique that has its own views that aren't necessarily the views of the majority of workers, often by way of things like the current set of executive nominating the new executive, and having them ratified by a large percentage of workers who will vote the union ticket without much thinking. The result is that over time, the union leadership tends to just be the people who will keep the union going in the same direction. It doesn't help that radicalism sounds sexy, and so the elected leaders tend to be very strongly pro-union. This tendency towards a certain kind of person in charge tends, I think, to encourage the other issues I have with them. Large unions seem to love to treat labour unions like an end and not a means. They often give the impression of forgetting that the fundamental purpose of a union is collective bargaining, and instead become large lobby organizations that use their member dues to fight in the political arena. An excellent example is when a union representing some, but not all, workers at a given employer manages to get a deal requiring all employees to be unionized. While this might sound good on the face of it, if the employer (say, a construction worker) also wishes to hire employees in a job that isn't normally unionized (say, HR), this puts a tremendous drag on the employer and ultimately isn't likely to benefit the represented employees. Large unions seem to invariably end up in the political arena on things not directly related to their fundamental work. It is entirely understandable for a union of any size to be in the political arena arguing for and against measures that directly relate to its fundamental work of collective bargaining, such as by arguing against a back-to-work bill, or lobbying for anti-scab legislation, the bigger unions seem to often go beyond that by arguing for things that affect \"the working-class,\" such as arguing for lower taxes. On the face of it, this seems like their job, because they represent workers, but in reality, I think that unions should stay out of these debates because it is not their job to dictate the political preferences of their members. They may have members who want to pay more tax and get more public services, and they may have members who want the government to stay out of their lives. They are members of the union for an imminently practical reason and should not be forced into conflict on political grounds. (Even worse, some unions seem to go even farther into the political arena, coming up with positions on things like Israeli-Palestinian relations, which have nothing to do with their members' jobs or well-being) Lastly, and probably most importantly, the big unions seem to often be extremely insensitive to the employers' needs, ultimately to the detriment of the workers they represent. The unions get into a narrow state of mind where increased wages and benefits are always seen as good things, regardless of the cost. The most egregious example of this is Hostess Foods, which recently closed its doors because the union refused to come to terms. Ultimately, the union's decision to hold out did not help any of its members; instead, they all lost their jobs because the demands were too steep. For a longer-term example, the auto industry in the USA was done in by increasing union-derived benefits which they had to pay for, draining more and more from the companies until they could no longer support themselves. I'm going to lump things like seniority systems in here as well: they benefit certain workers (the ones who perform less well) at the expense of the employer (who may find great difficulty acquiring competent workers for a position, and accordingly suffer from inefficiencies or worse things). Public sector unions have a special place here in my heart, because the nature of their bargaining position is different than a private-sector one. Almost without exception, a public sector union does not have to worry about accidentally driving their employer bankrupt. Instead, their ultimate failure is political: the government simply legislates a solution that the union can do nothing about. This is politically costly, however, and the unions do their best to make it as costly as possible, so the result can be utter silliness in the public sector. I believe I've been told that the Thatcher union busts were driven in part by a union demand that all children of union workers be guaranteed jobs for life. I think that unions definitely have a very positive role to play in securing workers against abuses by employers and ensuring fair working environment, and especially have had an important role historically in developing modern workers' rights. But I feel that the game has changed and large unions' modern activities do not always properly represent those they claim to serve, and that ultimately their activities have become more of a negative influence than a positive one.

I am, however, mildly concerned or at least intrigued as to where this debate or issue ends. The reason it's troubling for me is that the most common arguments used to support gay marriage are that \"love is love\" and \"loving who you choose is your right.\" What these arguments implicitly say is that the necessary criteria to be allowed to marry is that you love that which you are marrying. Now I won't delve into the typical response of \"Next thing you know, it'll be legal to marry your pets!\" because I find that particularly hyperbolic and non-productive to the discussion. But I do feel that this open mindset of the definition of marriage will definitely lead to a future debate about what \"marriage\" is. I believe that the next group to demand legal marriage rights will be polygamists, and that the same arguments of \"love is love\" will still apply. My fear is that despite this good ruling today, we have opened up the door to extremely loose and liberal interpretations of the meaning of \"marriage\" to include anything we want it to under the law. Further, I believe that polygamy is harmful to society and that raising children in a polygamous is harmful to their growth. I believe that polygamy is not a natural arrangement for humans, and that no matter what, it will be emotionally damaging to at least one person in this \"relationship.\" But then as I type those words, I realize that the exact same things were said about gay marriage in recent history.

{"original_text": "Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be \"free speech means the state can't control what you say. It doesn't mean freedom from consequences from everyone else.\" If it's on the internet it is equally likely that this [xkcd] will be shown. This does seem at first to be a reasonable point of view. However, I believe it is flawed for several related reasons. The first reason is that underestimates the power of the public. Just because the state is not infringing your right does not mean others cannot. With other rights this is accepted as part of the system. For instance, if a company refused to serve or allow access to black people that would be considered a violation of their rights despite it not being the government. In the same way, you couldn't claim a country has gender equality if women can't be get a job, despite there being no law against hiring women. Unless freedom of speech can be distinguished from those other rights, which I believe it cannot, there can be no distinction between private agents and the state in terms of freedom of speech. Secondly, the right to free speech includes the right to unimpeded free speech, if that makes sense. It is not enough to be allowed to say what you want, you have to be allowed to communicate to who you want. It makes more tense in terms of letters. Freedom of speech is not fulfilled by allowing me to write letters, it is only fulfilled by allowing their delivery. Using the example from the comic, continually showing someone the door is the same as standing by the pillar box and shredding the letters as I post them. The final reason is that extreme reactions to someone's use of free speech can restrict it by effectively punishing them for exercising their right. If I punched someone for suggesting marmite was a valid option for toast, would I not be restricting their right to free speech? Equally, if I was sacked for making a racist reddit post, am I not being punished for exercising my right to freedom of speech? I'm not entirely convinced on this point because it might restrict someone else's freedom of speech to criticise or their freedom of association to not have to put up with me, but I would still say there is some validity to this point. Just to be clear, I don't think freedom of speech should never be restricted but I do think those restrictions should be acknowledged which the phrase \"freedom of speech, not freedom from consequences\" does not. Edit: This has been quite an intense discussion. I'm beginning to think there is too much free speech. Seriously though, there has been a lot of good comments and I'll try to respond as quick as I can, although that may be tomorrow for some.

{"original_text": "It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. We already have it! It's the trains! If public transport such as railways are expanded and given priority over road vehicles in infrastructure, then we can achieve the goals that the automotive industry is trying to achieve very quickly. We should divert the resources that we spend on making smarter cars (finances and human capital) to making smarter, faster, safer, public transport and expand the rail network. If we just expand the rail network then people will automatically shift from driving a car to riding on a train as their preferred choice of daily commute. Some of the points I have against road transport for individuals. Environmental impact- A vast majority of cars are running on fuels that emit pollutants in the environment. Safety- Road injury was one of the top 10 causes of death in the world. According to WHO, road injury took lives of 1.3 Million people in the last decade. Stress- While driving for enjoyment is really fun on your off days, daily commute hardly is. We are spending a nice chunk of our day that we can spend relaxing, reading or working to complete the last minute project on a rather stressful, and repetitive driving route facing traffic jams and asshole drivers. Energy efficiency - A car owner takes a Ton of metal with him just to get from point A to B. Fuel efficiency of trains is superior to that of cars. Maintenance - a car requires frequent upkeep and maintenance of its parts and components. Economy - Transportation is lot more expensive in cars.

In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article] that lays out some criticisms of the first article's source study, along with a rebuttal from another journalist who's written on the topic. I believe that: 1. You, or someone in your family, are more likely to be killed by your gun either purposefully or accidentally than you are to use the gun against an attacker successfully in self-defense. 2. Therefore, if your goal is to make yourself andor your family safer, then choosing to keep a gun in your home explicitly for that purpose is an irrational decision. I do believe there is one exception to this. If you have a particular reason or belief that you are likely to be attacked, then, since the odds of being attacked have increased dramatically, then it may be rational to have a gun in the house for self-defense. For example, if you have a stalker. If you have received threats on your life. If you have any reasonable belief that someone will try to harm you specifically. If government or police forces have broken down. Basically, if the odds change so that for you the risk of you or your family being attacked is greater than the risk of having a gun in the house, then it would be rational to have a gun. But we do know, statistically, on average, that is not the case. So for the average person, the risks are such that the rational decision for maximizing safety is to not keep a gun. I further believe that if you get other uses out of the gun other than just self-defense, then the other added benefits of having a gun would make it rational to keep one in the house. For example, if somebody was a hunter and or target shooter and they get a lot of joy out of their hobby, that could be worth the risk of gun ownership. Or even if someone cited tradition, or the need of an armed populace as a check on the government, that too could be a perceived benefit to them that makes the safety risk worthwhile.

A key feature of Islamic Terrorism is theological ignorance. Islam only permits violence in certain circumstances, which are fairly well established. This mirrors a general ignorance among Muslims of what Islam is. This is compounded by the fact that Sheiks pass on their knowledge to students via a mentoring process.

Reading through threads concerning this issue here on Reddit has made me wonder if I'm just a heartless jackass or not since it appears most of Reddit goes against the grain with me on this issue here. I don't feel like it's wrong to drug test welfare recipients. I agree somewhat with the view that if I am required to pass a drug test to even have a shot at a job, a welfare recipient should have to do the same to receive assistance which they're not required to work for. I've heard that a 30 day rehabilitation option is offered in some states for people who test positive, and benefits are cut off for those who refuse that option. I don't agree with punishing someone for addiction and not offering help, but if the drug testing states implemented this policy, I don't think I'd see any problems with it at all. I feel this way because I've been in a lot of situations where this has been a relevant issue. Cashiering for a small town grocery store growing up, knowing the people using food stamps at the counter, and also knowing that the majority if them are using drugs (small town) helped me form an opinion early on. I didn't think it was fair that at 16, my tax money was being used to help someone pay for food when they spent their money on drugs. If they wanted food, why not by it instead of drugs? Of course, now that I'm older I realize that not everything is so black and white, and that this goes deeper than my 16 year old opinion. I'm a home health nurse that works with pediatric patients in their homes. My patients are almost always in very poor, run down neighborhoods. All of these families are on food stamps and government assistance (my nursing contract is paid through their Medicaid) and literally, out of the last 10 families I've worked with, 4 of the parents used some kind of drug in front of me, and at least 3 more parents were very obviously using drugs. I'm not counting alcohol or tobacco use either, just what's actually being tested for. I have compassion and empathy for people, and I'm very left-leaning on most issues. I'm 100 for human rights, and I try to imagine myself in other's shoes before forming an opinion, but this is something that I just don't see a problem with, especially if rehabilitation is an offered option. I've also struggled with my own habits and addictions to alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana. I realize not all people are the same, but any time I've needed a job badly enough, I've been able to kick the weed and nicotine long enough to pass a pre employment screening. I feel like that's my responsibility, and that plays into why I've formed the opinion that I have. So help me out, CMV. Change my view. Edit: I should also probably note that I understand the low statistics on how many people actually do end up popping positive in these tests, and I realize that it's costing a lot of tax money to do so.

{"original_text": "I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have livedcurrently live there, I could not be more dead set against ever moving there. In fact, I have come to despise that place. As a quick note about the perspective I have: I'm a 3rd-year law student. I grew up in South FL, and currently live in Boston, MA. I'm not a stranger to life in a northeastern American city; maybe city life in general is not for me, although I do like Boston much better than New York. First, it's filthy. There is trash everywhere, the water is polluted, and the air simply does not smell clean. Being an old Northeastern city, it's filled with old buildings, many of which are in varying degrees of disrepair. It's just generally a dirty, sad place for me to be. It's also crowded. NYC has 8.5 million people crammed into around 300 square miles. To walk anywhere, you must wade through a sea of drab, disheveled humanity. The public transit is packed. Driving in NYC is one of the most hellish experiences I've ever had. The cost of living is exorbitant, as everyone already knows. Rent alone takes up most of my friends' paychecks, and their places aren't even that nice or spacious. New Yorkers seem like they pay through the nose for a standard of living that ain't that great. Then there's the climate. The winters are frigid and soul-crushing, complete with biting wind and extended periods of low sunlight or darkness. The summers are sweltering, and the heat only exacerbates the ever-present smell of rotting garbage. Plus, central air is apparently only for the wealthy northeasterners, because it is conspicuously scarce in most homesapartments I've visited. I can't understand the allure of that city. The wealthy live comfortable lives while most everyone else pays through the nose to live wretchedly. People get an inexplicable sense of self-importance and accomplishment simply by moving there and living there for a bit, regardless of what they're doing. Maybe I'd feel accomplished too, if I paid 800month to live in a cardboard box and resisted the temptation to commit suicide by antagonizing the psychotic, fascist police to which NYC is a home. TL;DR NYC is a crowded, dirty, dismal place and I cannot ever picture myself being happy there. CMV.

Quoting rule 4's explanation of delta: \"Please note that a delta is not a sign of'defeat', it is just a token of appreciation towards a user who helped tweak or reshape your opinion. A delta end of discussion\" (emphasis added).

{"original_text": "Egoism is the claim that everyone should always act to maximize their own self interest. I'm going to sketch my version of egoism, based largely on Ayn Rand's ethics, and then deal with some common objections to it. Part 1: Egoism Before we can discuss morality, we have to discuss the nature of values. Something's being a value to someone presupposes a goal and an alternative faced in pursuit of that goal. For example, a house is a value to someone because they have the goal of acquiring shelter and, facing the alternative of getting a house or not having shelter, have chosen to get a house. The fundamental alternative, which gives meaning to all of the others, is the alternative of life and death. Therefore, the only context in which it makes sense to talk about something being of value to someone is a context in which they are struggling to live in some way and the value in question aids them in their pursuit of life. Every organism is confronted with values and disvalues. For example, to a tree, fertile soil is a value, and rocky soil is a disvalue. To a lion, catching a gazelle is a value, and going hungry is a disvalue. Every type of organism has a means of survival that, under suitable conditions, allows it to acquire its values. Plants automatically put down roots and grow leaves. Non-human animals, higher on the scale, have consciousness in the form of instincts which tell them what to do automatically. However, non-human organisms do not have moral values. What makes humans able to have moral values, but not other organisms? The fact that human beings have the ability to reason, which is the human means of survival. Human beings, unlike other animals, do not automatically know what to do. They have to develop a system of principles that will tell them how to achieve those things that they value, i.e., a moral code. Since this is the only legitimate purpose of morality, moral codes can be assessed by whether or not they are conducive to man's life, i.e., the life of the actor. In practice, this moral standard leads to a morality based on the virtues of rationality, productivity, and pride. Rationality means using one's mind to one's fullest ability in pursuit of one's values and eschewing evasion on any subject. Productivity means acknowledging that you have to work to live and creating the physical values that your life requires. Pride means always trying to improve yourself morally until you are perfect. These three virtues lead to an upward spiral, where rationality tells you what goals to pursue, productivity allows you to pursue the goals, and the pride you earn thereby encourages you to seek out new and higher challenges to your mind. Part 2: Objections Probably the most common misconception about egoism is that it would lead us to lie, cheat and steal whenever we can get away with it. This is not true, because a rational egoist will acknowledge that reality is an integrated whole where everything bears on everything else. You can never count on getting away with lying, cheating or stealing, because your deception will be contrary to reality, which means that there will be innumerable facts that will tend to give you away, creating significant risk whether the other person finds those facts or not. Even if you get away with your lie or theft, it will change you, creating a precedent in your mind for more lying, cheating or stealing in the future, and who knows if you will get caught then? If we are looking at reality and not evading it, then it is clear that we should adopt honesty as a principle that we always adhere to. (There is an exception to this in the case where Nazis are knocking on the door asking if you are hiding Jews in your basement, but such cases are very rare.) Another, related objection asks what an egoist would do if they were stuck in the middle of the ocean with another person on a life raft that could only hold one. The answer to this is that morality only applies to cases where long term survival is possible - in cases where long term survival is not possible, \"life boat scenarios,\" no moral principles apply. This is because the purpose of morality is to tell us how to live, not to deal with bizarre cases that almost never occur, and a morality that could deal with all conceivable cases would be so abstract as to be useless. So, there is no rule about what an egoist has to do in a life boat scenario - in the scenario I just described, one could either let the other person on the life raft and allow oneself to drown, or one could fight the other person off to preserve one's own life. Neither choice is open to moral evaluation. To change my view about this, you must give a convincing objection to the argument for egoism in Part 1. Your case will be more convincing if you also provide a more compelling argument for a non-egoist morality. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"original_text": "I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at the keys and often hunting and pecking. I personally consider this a major problem because I think it is holding us back to some extent. Some points that I use to support this argument: 1. Faster typing more productivity, businesses would benefit. You could do more paperwork, more homework, anything on the computer. I'd argue that if everybody could type, we'd all have more free time as well, or at the very least GDP would increase as we get more work done in less time. 2. It's useful for personal and professional activities: Even if all you do is type posts on facebook and write an email to your grandkids, knowing how to type will help you. 3. It's easy to learn. It's all muscle memory, and if you practiced for an hour a day you'd be good in a month. Plus there are programs galore for it. So, my view is that if university required you to know how to touch-type, perhaps with a modest WPM test on entry, or at least a freshman-year course, people would be forced to learn it and would become better typists, thus benefiting everyone down the line. Why university? Because minimum wage workers don't usually need to type on a computer, making it less necessary at the high school level. Also, in university, you'll be typing a hell of a lot. I don't care what course you take, you'll need to type up essays and ultimately a thesis paper. Am I overblowing this? To quote the great Mugatu, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. To me it's at least as important as learning how to write with a pen these days. I'd just like to understand why society currently seems to place no value in this skill, and that maybe I'm overreacting. Edit 1 Well, thanks for all the comments, it's been a very interesting discussion so far. The argument that's hanging onto me the most is that the keyboard may become obsolete, but I can't see that happening soon enough to justify ignoring a useful skill. For those who point out that we can learn it of our own free will and it's not the university's place, I feel that the long-term benefits of such a policy change benefit us in the long term. Universities often require you to study other things they feel are beneficial, such as learning another language (which is often taught inadequately), so I don't feel that it's outside the potential scope of a university to require typing. And for those pointing out that it isn't worth the time, I maintain that learning costs next to nothing, and it saves you time over the course of your life if you add up every time you type. Edit 2, View Changed ucheeseboyardee made the point that not everyone learns at the same rate and some people may not be able to learn to type well, and thus mandating it could exclude otherwise capable people.

Like I get it Fox news is racist, but I dont have to be racist because I critizice Islam. Its like the people who try to tolerate Islam somehow think its racist to criticize it, failing to see that there is a diverse spectrum of people who believe in Islam and not just middle eastern people.

{"original_text": "When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan land on Tatooine, they encounter Watto, a junk dealer who owns two slaves, Anakin Skywalker and his mother Shmi. When Qui-Gon learns he cannot buy them from Watto, he gambles for Anakin's freedom. I believe that Qui-Gon should have removed both Anakin and Shmi from Watto's control, using force (or the Forcehaha) if necessary. Since the Jedi are \"guardians of peace and justice,\" they are presumably called to right moral wrongs. While slavery is apparently not illegal on Tatooine, it is nevertheless immoral, and Qui-Gon seems to recognize this. I realize that gambling on the podrace was necessary, since it would be wrong to take Watto's (non-living) property by force, even if he was dead. But I believe that once the race was over, and Qui-Gon had obtained the parts for the ship under the arrangement he and Watto made, Qui-Gon should have freed Shmi Skywalker using any means necessary. Change my view. EDIT: You guys are sending in some great responses, I'll try to get them all after I get to work. There's a couple that keep coming up that I have issue with, though. Watto was a good master - Yes, but she's still a slave. Being a slave sucks bantha balls. Anakin was the only one who needed to be freed - Yes, but Shmi shouldn't have to be a slave forever because she's not important enough to the story. Qui-Gon couldn't free all the slaves - Yes, but that doesn't mean he shouldn't free the ones he can. Anakin needed to sever his emotional connections - Yes, but it seems like he would be more attached to his mother if she was still a slave billions of miles away than if she was living somewhere safe and comfortable. The Force wouldn't work on Watto - Toydarians are immune to mind tricks, not being hurled around the room with the Force like a ragdoll. EDIT: uMakesPoorDecisions changed my mind. Anakin would most likely not have become a Jedi if he could have lived with his mother and been free.

{"original_text": "This view of mine might sound obvious or simple but I think a lot of sensitive, complex social issues have simple underlying causes that are often ignored. In fact, I think they are so often ignored that I start to doubt my own view, hence this post. I'm a little embarrassed to share it. Here's my basic line of thought: Stereotypes exist because the generalization is accurate. Several of society's popular problems are blamed on other people acting with an awareness of stereotypes, or the stereotypes themselves. A lot of cases regarding these problems are caused or made worse by the victim acting in accordance with a stereotype while blaming either the stereotype or something else. If people made more of a conscious effort to not act in accordance with a stereotype in a situation where the stereotype could be considered relevant less incidents would occur. When less incidents occur the stereotype changes or evaporates completely. 'Victim' is somewhat of a loose term here (I'm excluding people who are indirectly involved with an incident pertaining to whatever social ill anyone might refer to) so before you shout \"victim blaming!\" I'll freely state that yes, I believe victims are very rarely 100 free from some kind of responsibility. An example would be a black man being pulled over in a bad neighborhood and getting ticketed, arrested, or worse after arguing with resisting the police officer. We might be able to argue the man was unfairly profiled, but we can't prove something like that. It's much easier to take preventative measures (respect and compliance with the officer, no matter how shitty of a person they may be) and either avoid the situation completely or not make it harder than it needs to be. But once the black driver starts getting loud and upset, in the cops mind he's just another loud black person (fulfilling the stereotype) which could lead the officer to believe that the driver fulfills other aspects of his stereotype. Another quick example would be the stereotype of men only being interested in sex and men saying \"not all men are pigs.\" Well, if that stereotype upsets you as a man, the only thing you can really do that will have any kind of effect is to not be a pig! But nobody seems to realize this, they just want everyone else to do what they ask. Obviously I'm not proposing an over-night fix to any social issue, but what I'm proposing would benefit our society a lot more than victims telling everyone else to stop stereotyping. Pointing the finger at the aggressor (s) doesn't actually help solve the whole problem; all that does is either end that individual incident or piss people off. That shortsightedness does absolutely nothing to solve the problem on any kind of large, lasting scale. I'm happy to edit for any needed clarification. CMV! Hello, users of CMV!

{"original_text": "Increasingly, many argue that elementary statistics should be a mandatory subject in the high school curriculum. I agree with this wholeheartedly, as the discipline has become central to civic and economic literacy in the 21st century. But to argue, as some have, that this should replace the traditional \"algebra to calculus\" high school math sequence makes about as much sense to me as arguing that history should replace English. While the two undoubtedly share some skills and mechanics, they are fundamentally different disciplines with fundamentally different roles in the curriculum, and both are necessary for a complete education. Although the underlying mechanics of statistics are undoubtedly mathematical, increasingly it is becoming recognized as a discipline in its own right, with its own methodology and best practices distinct from those of pure mathematics, and the structure of high school should reflect this divergence. At the high school level, the focus of statistics pedagogy should be on core concepts, the appropriate use of technology, and interpretation you are teaching a student to turn data into an accurate, precise probablistic statement, and to have an intuitive understanding of the probability concepts underlying the meaning of that statement. These are important skills, but they aren't really mathematical skills in the traditional sense; you are reasoning in a different mode. In a well-taught algebra, geometry, or calculus class, by contrast, students learn to reason deductively rather than inductively, learn the theory underlying core mathematical notions such as function and equivalence, solve non-routine problems, and use mathematics of all types to analyze real-world phenomena. None of these skills except arguably the last play any role in an elementary statistics curriculum. You can argue that a deep facility with \"abstract\" math has little importance in the \"real world,\" but increasingly the 21st century economy does reward individuals who have a high capacity for abstraction and problem-solving, even if you are never directly using specific skills (the classic \"when will I ever need the quadratic formula in real life\" bugbear). Finally, learning these mathematical concepts is a necessary prerequisite for any further study in STEM fields, which statistics training will not replace. Thus, BOTH statistics and math, as separate disciplines, should have a role in the high school curriculum. As a final note, I should mention that I am here presupposing that both statistics and pure math can are taught well. Obviously, a well-taught statistics class is much more useful than a poorly-taught math class, and vice-versa. I'm well aware that bad mathematics teaching (and bad statistics teaching, for that matter) is rampant in the U.S., so I'd prefer to keep the horror stories along those lines out of this particular discussion and stay focused on the best-case possibilities of both subjects. EDIT: Thank you to those of you who have been willing to engage me on the substantive pedagogical questions. I have re-thought my initial claim and now concede that there are alternatives to the traditional algebra sequence when it comes to teaching abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills. I still stand by my argument that statistics fundamentally stands apart from math, and should probably be seen as a separate subject with some connections to math (akin to physics or computer science) rather than as an optional class within the math department. But there are alternatives to the algebra-geometry-trig-calculus sequence that might better reinforce the connections between statistics and math while still accomplishing all the important educational goals. To those of you more interested in debating the logistical nuts and bolts (concerns about burdensome mandates on schools, etc.): thank you also for your participation in the conversation. Some have made arguments that all state mandates on school curriculum are unnecessarily burdensome or will cost too much; I believe this premise has empirically denied, so these arguments are not convincing to me. Others have made the point that, in the event that states are unwilling to add new credit hours to their diploma requirements, we risk adding statistics at the expense of electives or core courses. This is a more compelling argument, but ultimately a risk I am willing to take, since I believe that in most if not all states there is room in the existing credit structure to responsibly add statistics in place of at least one course. As a separate issue, I think increasing credit hour minimums and extended school days are serious proposals that should be given consideration as possibilities, though it is not my intent to make a full argument in favor of them here. Unless you have something substantially different to offer than the above two arguments, I doubt I will be convinced by further discussion along these lines. Thank you again to all who responded.

{"original_text": "First off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised. Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, in the exact same way that pain associated with other surgical procedures I have had under general anesthesia as an adult does not exist because I cannot remember it. The WHO currently recommends male circumcision for HIV prevention and \"as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package.\" It is primarily recommended in areas with high incidences of HIV, but given its demonstrated effect at reducing the spread of the virus I prefer to have any added protection possibly available. I would plan to infer the same protection to any hypothetical children born at this time, especially considering that the complication rates here are significantly lower than in the areas where it is most strongly recommended by the WHO. Living in the midwest U.S. it is culturally nearly expected, with 70-80 prevalence. Because of this, many to most potential sexual partners in my area (including myself, as a gay male) prefer the aesthetic of a circumcised penis. With the research consensus demonstrating no adverse effects on sexual performance, I see no reason to not stick with the cultural norm. What may help change my view: Scientific studies demonstrating prolonged psychological damage due to infant male circumcision.

Not because I choose to, but because the person who drives me to work does (and as driver, it's fair enough that she can choose to listen to what she wants). As a result, I have had to listen to the most vacuous, derivative, leg-gnawingly obnoxious garbage the putrid pop industry has to offer. I can't seem to find it on Google, but there's a song that sounds vaguely like Daft Punk's irritating \"technologic,\" but this one is even worse. It goes \"work it, bring it, play it bitch; work it, bring it, bitch; work it, bring it, play it bitch.\" Lyrically, this song seems to have been thought up in about 5 minutes by a bored hormonal teenager. What exactly are we meant to enjoy about lyrics like that? You may argue that the lyrics aren't the focus or the point of the song: but in which case: why have them at all? Or why not use the song as a chance to explore the depths of the beautiful and varied English language? A string of nonsentical words and phrases would be more interesting to listen to than this tripe. Then there's the bafflingly popular 'Uptown Funk' by Bruno Mars and that guy who seems to use the same brass riff in all of his songs. Crass, self-masturbatory garbage where the singer pretty much spends the entire song telling us how cool and how hot he is, and how much he likes to party. Seriously? The UK's number 1 song is yet another arrogant twerp telling us about how much he likes to party? Can we just accept that most people like to party and move on from this lyrical theme? Why do we have to be told again and again - song after song - that people are enjoying themselves in the club, all night long? Do these brain-dead pop puppets have anything interesting to say about parties that hasn't been said a million times since the 70s? Every singly 'partyclub' song seems to be just: I'm really hot You're really hot This partyclub is awesome Is it even possible to be more boring than this? Who enjoys being told these simple ideas day in, day out, by thousands of narcissistic pop morons? Now we come to the songs about love. Love has been a perfectly valid subject for poetry and art since the days of Catullus. Along with sex and death, it's a massive part of human experience. So how have these pompous pop pretzels managed to reduce it to lyrics so dull and formulaic that they could have been written by a computer program? Rita Ora, Charlie XCX, Elli Goulding, Taylor Swift... every day we listen to the same people saying the exact same things about the exact same subject. Love and sex are intensely deep and complex aspects of the human experience. Why doesn't anyone have anything new or interesting to say about it? HOWEVER: There is one exception. Currently the only song played on Radio 1 at the moment with vaguely decent lyrics is 'Take me to Church' by a singer named Hozier. He's still singing about love, but the lyrics are absolutely head and shoulders over the vomit spewed out by the Nicki Minajs and Jessie Js of the pop genre. [Check the lyrics out] . Finally, a pop artist played on Radio 1 with something fresh and interesting to say about love!

{"original_text": "My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in the wild is \"xexerxerself\" or \"ziziszimself.\" My argument is as follows: 1. Pronouns are always dealing with a spectrum. A \"he\" can be used to describe both masculine as well as feminine men and similarly for she and women. The singular they is also covering a spectrum, the spectrum of all people that do not identify with either gender or those that identify with both to differing degrees. Therefore they is sufficient to describe alternative gender identities. 2. If we'd decide that new pronouns are necessary to describe or be inclusive to specific non-standard gender identities, we would very likely end up with a sheer infinite amount of pronouns. Since the argument for further pronouns would not be based on scientific facts but rather on feelings of individual people, the argument why some new pronouns are okay and others aren't would be a very difficult one to make. The result would be that we would have to allow anyone to pick or create their own pronouns. 3. Since we'd have a large number of new pronouns people would very likely get confused, since they'd not only have to remember a name and a face but also the specific pronouns of a person AND incorporate those into everyday speech. The result would either be that people would start inadvertently giving offence or our speech patterns would change to rely far more on using names instead of pronouns. 4.

{"original_text": "To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting there, what I have observed in my school's mathematics system shows that these skills rely heavily on memorization and calculation, much less on reasoning, and virtually none on application. I've looked at the Common Core website and seen that these accurately reflect the standards put out. Let's take the [Common Core Algebra standards] as an example. If you scroll down to the Overview, you see that almost all of the skills listed are to solve equations or something of that sort. This is calculation. Common Core currently spends too much time on this, something relatively easy such that computers can do it. Some of this time needs to shift to the other branches of mathematics. I believe that algebra, as well as much of the rest of mathematics, should be used as a medium through which logic and reasoning are taught. Though computers can use logic to some extent, the human brain is much more capable and should be used for what it is needed for. [Here is a purely algebraic problem.] Despite the concepts being purely algebraic, it requires high levels of critical thinking and reasoning in order to solve. This is the type of multi-step problem that should be taught in high schools, but is almost always not. Common Core does not require students to display this level of critical thinking. Let's take [Geometry for another example.] If you scroll down to the Overview, these standards are somewhat better, since they introduce the notion of proof. However, on close inspection of the Congruence section, only a few basic proofs spanning a few basic proof types are necessary. These do not cover the important proof by contradiction and proof by induction, two kinds of reasoning that can be much better applied to the real world. It is also never required that the student prove any algebraic concepts, such as the quadratic formula. Most theorems in Geometry and all in Algebra are not proven, and the student is forced to memorize them. We have computers for that. We need people to prove and reason. It's also important for concepts like Geometry to be taught in conjunction with other areas of mathematics, such as Calculus. I took Geometry in 8th grade, and though that is a bit early for Calculus, the idea of limits and things like that should have at least been touched upon. Why is it that the volume of a pyramid is Bh3? The idea of taking some function to the limit makes it easy to prove this. Common Core does not cover this. So far, I've touched very little upon the idea of application, and mostly because that's the most difficult one. We know that mathematics is applied in all sorts of STEM subjects, but what if the student is already set on taking a liberal arts major? They shouldn't be forced to study engineering with math. So, I think that the application of mathematics needs to brought back to its roots, being the application of logic. Programming is great way to apply this, and though maybe math class isn't the right place for this, every student already has a programmable graphing calculator anyway. Instead of forcing students to not use programs on tests like they do at my school, I think that the use of programs should be encouraged, since they demonstrate understanding of the basis behind all mathematics, which is logic. Maybe this is straying a bit far from the purpose of Common Core, and it shouldn't be implemented as a guideline, but perhaps as a suggestion it would be great. I'll be going through Common Core for a few more years, and I want to know if it's effective. Please CMV.

{"original_text": "So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to argue otherwise (for some animals it is very easy to read their emotional state), but I won't argue that because I think the whole idea that consent would be necessary in these situations is completely inconsistent with how animals are treated by the vast majority of our population, including vegetarians. Example 1 (for the vegetarians, but applicable for everyone): Pet ownership. Do we get consent when we take a puppy from his parents? Do we get consent when we neuter them? If you assume that consent is essential in animalhuman relationships, pet ownership itself becomes a kind of slavery or imprisonment. The owner provides food and housing, the pet is imprisoned and provides entertainment to the owner. Any argument you could run about this being justifiable without consent would frighteningly similar to arguments for why slavery in the U.S. was good for many of the slaves. Arguments that they \"seem happy,\" or \"they don't run away\" are meaningless when you have kidnapped an animal and brought it up to be dependent on you. I'm not saying pet ownership IS slavery; I'm saying that the only way it pet ownership can be justified is if you toss out the idea of needing consent for our interactions with animals. Example 2 (for the carnivores): The vast majority of human beings eat animals. If you are one of this majority, the idea that you would ask an animals consent for anything is laughable. You could argue that unnecessary cruelty is still wrong, but much beastiality clearly involves the pleasuring of the animal, not the torturing of it. And regardless, arguments against cruelty have nothing to do with \"consent.\" So that's my basic argument. Come on reddit, change my view!

I think it is potential to argue otherwise ( for some animals it is very easy to read their emotional state ) , but I wo n't argue that because I think the whole idea that consent would be necessary in these situations is completely inconsistent with how animals are treated by the vast majority of our population , including vegetarians.

{"original_text": "I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. I am not disputing the fact that the United States achieved its principal militarypolitical goals (defeat of the Third Reich and the Japanese Empire), and I of course recognize the fact that the US managed to do so with virtually no civilian casualties destruction of the homeland, which is especially impressive given the sheer scale of civilian destruction seen in World War II. What I am arguing is that, having'won' (as much as it is possible to win) the war, the United States promptly lost its soul, and has ended up in a worse position than Germany or Japan. The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order. I think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on. It's a cycle that only leads to cartoonishly large military budgets and American blood spilled in conflicts where we don't belong. In short, hegemony has not been kind to the United States, and we would be better off if we weren't a world power. Contrast this with the Japanese and Germans, who are (arguably) doing rather well for themselves. Sure, each country was broken and defeated at the end of the war, and it took a very long time for them to recover, but they came out better. I say they came out better because neither the Japanese nor Germany have the'obligation' to police the world. In fact, both countries forbid themselves from taking offensive military action. While these countries can be (and often are) considered'western', and are sometimes the target of anti-western hate, they are not widely hated like the United States, and are not tasked with maintaining ridiculous global military presence. Rather (and forgive me for oversimplifying), Germany can focus on Germany and Japan can focus on Japan. One need not look long to find a wealth of statistics to indicate that these two nations have far superior social safety nets, education, healthcare, etc. than the United States. While this superiority can, of course, be attributed to a wide variety of factors, I believe that one cannot ignore the important fact that these nations have their priorities straight, having suffered the shame of defeat, having gone through the experience of rebuilding and being free of any expectation of global military prowess. What really solidifies this belief for me is the existence of universal health care in most of western Europe. I apologize that I don't have the source, but if I remember correctly, I remember watching an interview with a worker in the UK's NHS, who attributed the success of socialized medicine in Europe (versus the US) to the fact that Europe had to rebuild after World War II. Effectively, when you have to start from scratch and pick your life up from the rubble, there's a greater sense of common bond with the rest of your nation. The US, having not been hurt in the war in the same way, never had to rebuild and instead developed a more violently individualistic character, where the idea of potentially paying for someone else's health care is utterly repulsive. Americans, by virtue of having won World War II without civilian casualty, has ended up with a far worse society than those who'lost'. If that's the case, aren't we the real losers?

That being said... I don't believe that statuatory rape is something you can shame someone for. It is a sexual relationship between two people who have sexual desires, and have ageed and consented for that relationship. Obviously, I am not condoning sex with prepubescent children or infants, but I do believe the age of consent should be lower. A few reasons I think this: 1.) Biology We go through puberty in our teenage years. The human body comes ready for sexual activity and procreation, and the brain incites urges in people around this time. Why is it illegal to act on these urges? Suppose a 15 year old, sexually budding, has an opportunity to have consenaul sex with a 20 year old at thier physical and sexual prime. Is this desire wrong? Is it wrong for the 20 year old to give in? I don't think so. 2.) Law I can't speak for countries outside the US, but here, states without \"romeo and juliet\" laws will see 16 and 17 year old boys charged with statuatory rape for having healthy consenual sex with thier girlfriends who are within 1-2 years of thier age. Why is this as legally reprehensible as a 40 year old having sex with a 12 year old? No one will argue that the 40 year old having sex with the 12 year old is wrong.

{"original_text": "It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet. I've always found them annoying, say you're reading or studying at a cafe and they roar by louder than an invading Mongolian horde. God forbid they stop at a light since now you're stuck listening to that ungodly chortle for a good minute or so. I'm a single parent now and live by a fairly well travelled road. They wake my baby up consistently, and he has a hard time with his sleeping habits. It's a choice to make your vehicle that loud, not a necessity. On top of that, the rider or driver does not have to hear his most of his own racket since most of the sound is projected backwards. These people are assholes. I wish I could wake them up every 15 minutes with their own stupid vehicle. EDIT: I had no idea this post would get this big and, as much as I'd like to, I can't possibly hope to discuss this with all of you. Thank you to everyone, on both sides of the issue, for your reasoned and very interesting replies. The argument that got me closest to changing my view was surely that of safety. Other people are saying being loud is not as important for safety as actually driving well on a motorcycle, and this seems to be coming from cyclists as well, so unless I see some sort of peer reviewed study over anecdotal evidence that line of thinking isn't doing it for me. My favorite arguments were those along the lines of \"It's a free country, you're the one that's being inconsiderate by expecting the riders to be silent.\" The image of some tatted up Hell's Angel roaring through town and impinging on the hearing of 500 people and then screaming \"IM BEING OPPRESSED\" when someone suggests he tones down the throttle is simply delicious. A special thank you to everyone who called me a pussy via PM. It's good to know you care so much. I also learned that the sound that irritates so many of us so well is the sound of straight pipe exhausts. Cheers all! EDIT 2: uToastitoTheBandito did manage to change my view on this. [Here is the link to his comment] Thank you Toastito, and thank you for being considerate to others. Just a caveat here, there's a few comments in this thread that highlight the problem with some drivers very well. I'm not gonna call anyone out by name but the gist is that I'm annoyed over a minor inconvenience and I should get over it, people like driving loud cars and they're gonna keep doing it. I don't think any new parent would call it a minor inconvenience after spending 30 minutes putting a baby to sleep only to be woken up 5 minutes into his nap by a purposely loud vehicle. But this post isn't JUST about me, or my baby. These drivers drive past countless people. People who are gravely ill. People who own dogs that will shit on the carpet because they're scared of the sound. Nursing homes. Someone with a migraine headache. People who work the night shift. And all these little acts, each one is a little fuck you from the driver. And all these little fuck yous add up to one huge mega fuck you to your community. People with empathy get mad at this not just because it inconveniences them but because they know it inconveniences many others as well and the act is seen as grossly disrespectful because of that. One PM I got said: I drive a loud car. Why? Because I like it. He doesn't take the time to think, \"How will my actions affect those around me? Is there any chance the thing I am about to do will harm someone, and, if that is the case, should I still do the thing?\" No, this person doesn't give a shit. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the very essence of being inconsiderate. andanasshole", "text_perturb": "It 's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they do n't care about other 's heartsease and quiet.

They wake my baby up consistently , and he has a intemperate time with his sleeping habits. It 's a choice to make your vehicle that loud , non a necessity. On summit of that , the rider or driver does not have to hear his most of his own racket since most of the sound is projected backwards. These people equal assholes. I wish I could wake them up every 15 minute with their own stupid vehicle. EDIT : I had no idea this post would get this big and , as much as I 'd like to , I ca n't possibly hope to hash out this with all of you. Thank you to everyone , on both sides of the issue , for your reasoned and really interesting replies. The argument that got me closest to changing my view exist surely that of safety. Other people are saying being loud is not as important for safety as actually driving well on a motorcycle , and this seems to be coming from cyclists as well , so unless I see some sort of peer reviewed study over anecdotal evidence that bloodline of thinking is n't doing it for me. My favorite arguments were those along the lines of `` It 's a free country , you 're the one that 's being inconsiderate by expecting the riders to follow silent. `` The image of some tatted up Hell 's Angel roaring through town and impinging on the hearing of 500 people and then call `` IM BEING OPPRESSED '' when someone suggests he tones down the throttle is simply delicious. A special thank you to everyone who call me a pussy via PM. It 's good to know you care so much. I also pick up that the sound that irritates so many of us so well is the sound of straight pipe exhausts. Cheers all ! EDIT 2 : uToastitoTheBandito get along manage to change my view on this. [ Here be the link to his comment ] Thank you Toastito , and thank you for being considerate to others. Just a caveat here , there 's a few gossip in this thread that highlight the problem with some drivers very well. I 'm not gon na call up anyone out by name but the gist is that I 'm annoyed over a minor inconvenience and I should get over it , people like driving loud cars and they 're gon na keep doing it. I do n't think any new parent would call it a minor inconvenience after spend 30 minutes putting a baby to sleep only to be woken up 5 minutes into his nap by a purposely loud vehicle. But this post represent n't JUST about me , or my baby. These drivers aim past countless people. People who exist gravely ill. People who own dogs that will shit on the rug because they 're scared of the sound. Nursing plate. Someone with a hemicrania headache. People who cultivate the night shift. And all these picayune acts , each one is a picayune fuck you from the driver. And all these little fuck yous add up to one brobdingnagian mega fuck you to your community. People with empathy get mad at this not just because it inconveniences them but because they know it inconveniences many others as well and the act is encounter as grossly disrespectful because of that. One PM I go said : I drive a loud car. Why ? Because I like it. He does n't take the time to think , `` How bequeath my actions affect those around me ? Is there any chance the thing I am about to do bequeath harm someone , and , if that is the case , should I still do the thing ? '' No , this person does n't give a shit. And that , ladies and gentlemen , is the very essence of personify inconsiderate. andanasshole", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "Hi! I'm trying to learn feminism which is a huge topic, and like all huge topics, has it's good and bad. I was recently introduced to the scathing disdain for the \"not all men\" sentiment. I'd like to start out by establishing a few things, because it's important to know that I don't support using this sentiment broadly. 1. Where a victim is grieving, confiding, venting, or however else they are dealing with a problem, it is an inappropriate time to use \"not all men.\" The focus belongs on the victim and their healing at that time, not nitpicking their wording. 2. \"Not all men,\" in the way I'm using it here, is actually \"not all X,\" where X is any group in a discussion that has a broad, negative statement said toward their group. We see it most frequently thanks to the (most often deserving) scorn targeted at the \"not all men\" sentiment, but I do mean Not all X, where X is any group. The value of accurate language As a young boy, when I said \"women are bad at math,\" my father corrected me. He said \"some women are bad at math.\" When my brother said \"you never let me go to town,\" he corrected him by saying \"I usually don't, but here are the times I did.\" My father took issue with \"global\" language, as he called it, no matter what form it came in, because he saw it as harmful. Have you ever felt a burden to prove you're some blanket statements that was often leveled against your kind? \"Women are bad at math,\" or \"women cry so easily,\" or \"blacks are stupid,\" or \"feminist hate men.\" For me personally, when I saw \"men are so shallow\" growing up I felt a sense of hostility from the statement. It felt like a judgement against me, and I felt like I had to carry the burden to show people that even though men are shallow, I'm a man and I'm not. The point is, if we use careful speech, like \"I hate it when men are shallow some men are so shallow,\" OR \"It really bothers me a woman cries over the smallest thing\" and \"some women cry so easily,\" we avoid creating broad, negative labels. These labels can create a great sense of shame in the targeted group, and this shame fosters a sense of otherness. Instead of the shamed person feeling included or a part of something, they feel excluded. This, and the shame can also sabotage a person's self value and chance at success. By biggest concern is the sense of otherness it can create, driving away potential allies, and by god we need a lot of allies to address the institutionalized racism and sexism in most western nations. Therefore 1. I believe it is in the best interest of those seeking to address an oppressive culture to use accurate language in order to be inclusive to as many as possible, to maximize their efforts 2. Just as it is the responsibility of the privileged to not use broad, negative language to describe the oppressed, it's also (far down on the priority list) the responsibility of the oppressed to not use broad, negative language to describe the privilege. Because, really, it's a human's responsibility to a human to not use broad, negative language against a human. To a reasonable length, of course, and I d not believe adding \"some\" before men, women, asians, etc, is much of a stretch. Picking an appropriate time Again, the time to say \"not all X\" is not when a victim is trying to overcome their harm. But in casual conversation, as a small aside, it is good for all people to correct others when they use this harmful, broad language. Conclusion TL;DR: No matter the group, broad language assigning negative traits to another group is harmful, and it is our responsibility as humans to take reasonable efforts to avoid propagating this harm, starting first with ourselves, second in mild conversation, and never while a victim is trying to overcome harm. We should never become comfortable using broad, negative language. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"original_text": "I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into taking her's husband's last name, and gay spouses also have a conundrum of their own. However, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. One small example is if you work in an industry where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind (like I do). It's helpful to know in advance who is related to who by just looking at a piece of paper. BUT, if the wife and the husband choose not to share a last name, please God settle on one name for your kid. Just flip a coin for which last name your kid takes if that's what you need to do. Don't make everyone around him have to deal with saying and writing out Reginald Henry Lieberman-Montgomery. A metaphor I would make for this would be gender pronouns. You have the right to tell me whether you identify as a man or a woman, but I swear to God if you insist that everyone around you refer to you strictly with the gender neutral pronouns Ni, Nem and Nir, I will be having none of it. As a counterpoint, I will say that I can't ever imagine myself taking my wife's last name. And if she chose not to take mine, I think I would feel a little disappointed. Further, I can't imagine feeling comfortable with my kid not taking my last name. So I already recognize a bit of the hypocrisy. In that way, I see that I am posing a problem without an apparent solution. On top of your rebuttals, I would also be curious to hear alternative ideassocial structures that could work to level the playing field, AND prevent me from having to say a mouthful. EDIT: Apologies for the day long delay car emergency took all night and all morning. Thanks for all your responses! Here are some of my views you've changed. Spain 'Murica. There's a clear system in place in Spanish countries that actually speaks to my \"one family name\" point. People consistently take the fathers, then mother's surname. Then the kid's kids will do the same. Gives you family history and also something to put on your mailbox. What I personally like about this is that it's uniform. If two last names were adopted country-wide in America, I would have much less of a problem with it. I also want to clarify: My problem with the \"mouthful\" of hyphenated last names does not mean that I would also suggest gentrifying the Krzyzewskis and the Chevaprevadumrongs of the world. To shorten your family name is to bastardize it. No ill feelings to those with shortened last names of course my last name was actually gentrified two generations ago. Finally, here is a post that very well summarizes my American sentiments: While this drifts from your true argument, these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate, which in my experience usually boils down to \"People who name their kids something I like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. People who name their kids something I dislike or don't understand are selfish and stupid.\" You have not said this, but I think it is worth pointing out that are cultural biases about names are deep-seated. You want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most comfortable. If a stranger's choice is not based on your preference, they are selfish and inconsiderate. When a family you do not know fills out a birth certificate, you ask that the FIRST priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years, and the SECOND priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate. My American sensibilities that shorter is better are deeply ingrained and will probably be there'til I die. That said, at least I can recognize them so that I know to keep them in check. While I will continue to make fun of people who have two last names, it will be with the same conviction that I make fun of everyone else. No hostility here.

Just flip a coin for which last name your kid takes if that 's what you necessitate to do. Do n't make everyone around him have to deal with saying and writing out Reginald h Lieberman-Montgomery. A metaphor I would fix for this would be gender pronouns. You have the right to tell me whether you identify as a man or a woman , but I swear to God if you insist that everyone around you refer to you strictly with the gender impersonal pronouns Ni , Nem and Nir , I will be having none of it. As a counterpoint , I will say that I ca n't ever imagine myself taking my wife 's last public figure. And if she chose not to take mine , I think I would feel a little thwarted. Further , I ca n't imagine feeling comfortable with my kid non taking my last name. then I already recognize a bit of the hypocrisy. In that way , I hear that I am posing a problem without an apparent solution. On top of your rebuttals , I would also be rummy to hear alternative ideassocial structures that could work to level the playing field , AND prevent me from having to say a mouthful. EDIT : Apologies for the  hour interval long delay car emergency took all night and all morning. thanks for all your responses ! Here are some of my views you 've changed. spain 'Murica. There 's a clear system in place in Spanish countries that actually talk to my `` one family name '' point. People consistently take the fathers , then mother 's family name. Then the kid 's tiddler will do the same. Gives you family history and also something to put on your postbox. What I in person like about this is that it 's uniform. If two net names were adopted country-wide in America , I would have much less of a problem with it. I also want to clarify : My problem with the `` mouthful '' of hyphenated last names does not mean that I would also suggest gentrifying the Krzyzewskis and the Chevaprevadumrongs of the earth. To contract your family name is to bastardize it. No ill feelings to those with shortened last names of course my last name was really gentrified two generations ago. Finally , here is a post that very good summarizes my American sentiments : While this drifts from your true argument , these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate , which in my experience usually boils down to `` People who name their kids something I like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. the great unwashed who name their kids something I dislike or do n't understand are selfish and stupid. `` You have not said this , but I think it is worth pointing out that constitute cultural biases about names constitute deep-seated. You want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most well fixed. If a stranger 's choice is not base on your preference , they are selfish and inconsiderate. When a family you do not love fills out a birth certificate , you ask that the FIRST priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years , and the SECOND priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate. My American sensibilities that shorter is better are deep ingrained and will probably be there'til I die. That said , at least I can recognize them so that I bed to keep them in check. While I will continue to make fun of people who have two last names , it will be with the same judgment of conviction that I make fun of everyone else. No hostility hither. thanks guys !", "label": 1}

People are dying under the famines and in the concentration camps. The longer we wait, the more people will suffer and die. Taking action as soon as possible would cause a high death toll but can potentially be made up for it by the fact that we'd be taking action soon and not \"whenever unexpected situations lead us to.\" Plus, it's arguable that simply leaving things be is'inhumane'. 2. Long-term, a unified Korea would turn into an economic powerhouse. We have two countries with very strong work ethics, a country with a ton of technological advancements and billionaire tech companies, another country with a ton of cheap labor (that can help jump start the economy after unification), lots of natural resources that would offset the costs, and infrastructure that must be built in the northern half of the peninsula. Some experts say a unified Korea can surpass Japan in economic power. 3.

{"original_text": "This is going to be a long one. After the video Look up I had a short discussion with some friends that I have only met online, never even seen their faces and I seemed to have a very unpopular opinion. I would give up all my social contacts to become pretty much one with the online world. Here is why: I didn't really have what you'd call a good childhood and it is bad to base your opinions on your childhood, but so far in life I didn't have a single person that was truly important to me. I have a depression and am classified as suicidal and I am taking medication against it. I always say I can't die unless my mother is dead, because she is so important to me, but really I just hate to see her sad, she really had a miserable life, and suicide would really make her sad. But then again I can't see a single reason why \"real life\" is important. People who live in America say there is an American dream, but really, the American dream died probably 1781 or so, I am not really good with American history, sorry. If you really think anyone can get from a dishwasher position to become a millionaire, you are dreaming. Your future life is pretty much settled depending on the family you are born in. If you don't have any special talents you will follow approximately the same route your parents followed. For me that would be education-employment-marriage-reproduction-death. That is boring. And also that is the whole reason for my argument. The whole world is just boring! For a long time I was interested in the weirdest body modifications and hair in wild colors, because I thought people who looked like that are different from the gray mass that are the people of today and I wanted to become like them. But I learned that no matter how weird someone looks, they are still a human, the most boring creature on this planet. But there is this place on earth where you still can become someone. Sure, it is harder today than a few years ago, but the internet is not locked yet. The internet is pretty much another world. You can go shopping, you can get entertained, you can travel and learn new things. If you take a bit of time, you can also learn the language of the internet and suddenly see how it is build, and you can build everything yourself. You can meet a ton of people, without even knowing their real name and you can talk about everything, you can hate, you can like, you can communicate. Even though they are getting ready to build them, at the moment there are no walls in the internet that you can't pass. You just need to know how. Heck, you can even work in the internet! I just think that as long as we can avoid all these planned walls in the internet, it is pretty much our world, with a few errors removed. Yes there are some, but far less than in the so called \"real life.\" One argument I have heard often is that people go crazy when they don't have any social interaction. I think that can be true for a lot of people, but I am currently strolling through Canada for 10 moths now. I had a job for 3 months and didn't make a single friend. Whenever I go out I have headphones on, so that nobody talks to me. My sleep schedule is so nocturnal that I get problems thing shopping for food.

{"original_text": "First, to the issue of consent. Can an 4 - 10 year old give consent? that is almost a definite no. But past that, if a kid can give consent to be picked up, to be punched by his friends, to ride a bike, to ride a car, why can heshe not give consent to sex? Of course, this view must hold that those even those younger than 10, those that can speak, can give consent, but I won't go there in this, as I will get a bunch of hate mail and witch-hunts as is common in western society's irrational hatred of anyone defending the \"pedos.\" So, what makes sex so taboo for children? I argue that it is subjective. You grew up seeing it as dirty, so you don't want your or other's children engaging in it, because you see it as dirty, and want to keep their \"innocence\" for as long as possible. Other crimes such as murder, assault, and robbery are much more objective, they do clear harm, and clearly violate another's right to life, their body, and their property. So, to expand on this. If a 12 year old can give consent to a 14, or something of that sort, why then, can they not give consent to someone much older? It is because you view it as icky. I will admit, in the majority of cases, the child is a victim of rape. So, clearly, if the victim speaks out soon or later, the case should be looked into, and prosecuted with the right evidence. But, it is clear to me, that if a 14 yo can give consent to a 16 yo, then he can give consent to anyone. On to the next part, sex offender's registry is complete bullshit. First of all, I fucking hate background checks. They perpetuate poverty, and only cause more crime. It makes it hard for criminals to get jobs, and they resort back to crimes. On top of that, sex offenders are treated so much worse. Why does raping someone, adult, or child, make you so much worse than someone who murdered and didn't get life? It is bullshit. There is the argument, \"but then how would we know if there's a sex offender living next door to my children!\" Well, that's incredibly unfortunate that you don't get to know everyone's backgrounds so you can keep your precious little critters safe, but that should be your responsibility. People make mistakes, but should be able to return to being normal human beings, citizens, when they do their time. Not to mention that the prison system does not help pedophiles change their ways at all. That needs to change as well. Furthermore, the most egregious of these I find, is the acceptance on reddit (though, suprisingly, the internet is far better at condemning this than the regular population) to pedophiles being beat, stabbed, and raped in jail. Reddit and 4chan are actually decent compared to regular society in recognizing that this is fucking insane! It happens way to often. And there is little activism against the abuse sex offenders get in prison, or even abuse in general in prison.

{"original_text": "So, it's obvious to anyone who took a math class that the average number of sex partners between straight men and straight women must be the same.

{"original_text": "Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view I hold. My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any or all of them or bring up new issues I haven't thought of. 1) Unpopular: The draft for the war in Vietnam was extremely unpopular with massive protests and draft dodging. After the draft was eliminated the protests died down even as the war continued. It seems that America will support a lot of military activity (Iraq War 1 2, Afghanistan, etc) as long as they are not personally forced to serve. 2) No close border crisis: Other modern developed countries have forced selective service (South Korea, Israel) but usually these countries face bordering existential crises to their very existence. America does not have this, has not ever had this, and presumably will not ever have this and so there is no need to have millions of men and women be conscripted every year for a tour of duty. 3) Nuclear Weapons: America may face small attacks here and there but no nation state large enough to possibly overthrow the United States government seems likely to attack for fear of nuclear weapons retaliation. While 911 was a tragedy, there was no hope of terrorists taking over the country or overthrowing the government. The only world forces strong enough to do this would be large nations with large militaries of their own and if they did have a mainland ground force invasion of US soil it would almost guarantee a nuclear response. 4) Women, and the out of shape: This is a minor reason but none the less I'll bring it up for discussion. In a modern draft there would be seemingly no way for women to avoid serving. Currently women face demanding physical aptitude tests to qualify for the most demanding positions or in some cases are barred from service for fear they will not be able to handle the physical requirements of the job (front line combat, Navy Seals, etc). In the 21st century when men and women have equal rights and are largely treated equally there would be pushback if those less capable of serving were thought to be more likely to get an easier or safer assignment. This would create a race to the bottom for applicants seeking to avoid dangerous duty. Furthermore the vast majority of Americans are overweight, out of shape, and would require extensive training to become combat ready. If diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, or any number of conditions would disqualify a person from service I imagine people would quickly engage in unhealthy habits (or bribe doctors) in order to avoid service. 5) Conscientious objectors: In previous generations there was a much stronger sense of duty, warrior culture, and sense of imminent danger which cultivated a value in service. In the modern world, where people increasingly distrust their government, have more access to information, and are more likely to have diverse religious and philosophical views I do not see the public getting behind any major military involvement that would require a draft. I would imagine there would be a rush to qualify yourself as a conscientious objector to the war in order to avoid combat even if that individual didn't feel that way immediately prior to the draft.

{"original_text": "NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization. Both of them should be abolished, though gradually. I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, but that: Current units cannot be transferred to a new tenant. If the original tenant on the lease at the time of the decontrol law vacates the unit, the unit can be listed by the landlord at market rates. Currently, other occupants related to the lessor can inherit the lease, meaning units pass down in families indefinitely. Newly constructed or rented units are not subject to any controls. Rents in all controlled units can rise by up to 5 per year. Rent decontrol be coupled with large scale upzoning to allow more housing to come on to the market. This will include infill construction in NYCHA housing projects where developers are willing to pay market rates for the land. Buildings which received Mitchell-Lama or other tax subsidies must pay back the subsidies with interest before decontrolling units which were built as a condition of the subsidy, on a pro-rated basis. The reason I want to abolish rent regulations in NYC is that it drastically reduces the available housing supply and harms people looking to move to or within the city. Anyone who has won the rent regulation lottery never moves out, and you end up with a highly inefficient allocation of apartments within the city. It also hugely depresses the creation of new rental units within the city, because new landlords see what happened to old landlords who got stuck with controlled units. I don't think there should be a property right in a rental. If you want a property interest in the place where you live, you should buy it. If you're renting, you should be subject to the market forces that come with that. Edit 1: I was hoping to get some replies before I had to step away, but so far it's just crickets.

{"original_text": "I don't particularly hold this view dearly, I just expect there might be some budding historians on Reddit with more information! It was influenced mostly by [this article] , which is fascinating if you just fancy some historical reading. Basically, if Napoleon has won at Waterloo, and completed his conquest of Europe (bar Russia, of course, and maybe England), the continent would have flourished economically, socially and politically, more so than now. I will highlight the main points below. 1. Revolutionary domestic reforms which all of Europe would have continued to benefit from. \"Yet he said he would be remembered not for his military victories, but for his domestic reforms, especially the Code Napoleon, that brilliant distillation of 42 competing and often contradictory legal codes into a single, easily comprehensible body of French law. In fact, Napoleon's years as first consul, from 1799 to 1804, were extraordinarily peaceful and productive. He also created the educational system based on lycees and grandes ecoles and the Sorbonne, which put France at the forefront of European educational achievement. He consolidated the administrative system based on departments and prefects. He initiated the Council of State, which still vets the laws of France, and the Court of Audit, which oversees its public accounts. He organized the Banque de France and the Legion d'Honneur, which thrive today. He also built or renovated much of the Parisian architecture that we still enjoy, both the useful - the quays along the Seine and four bridges over it, the sewers and reservoirs - and the beautiful, such as the Arc de Triomphe, the Rue de Rivoli and the Vendome column.\" Napoleon was an extraordinary governor. Many of his reforms are what the rest of Europe based their institutions on, only much later. 2. Napoleon was a lover, not a fighter. In September 1805, Austria invaded Napoleon's ally Bavaria, and Russia declared war on France as well. Napoleon swiftly won the ensuing War of the Third Coalition with his finest victory, at Austerlitz in 1805. The next year the Prussians also declared war on him, but they were soundly defeated at Jena; Napoleon's peace treaty of Tilsit with Russia and Prussia followed. The Austrians declared war on France once more in 1809, but were dispatched at the Battle of Wagram and signed yet another peace treaty. Napoleon started none of those wars, but he won all of them. After 1809 there was an uneasy peace with the three other Continental powers, but in 1812 he responded to France's being cut out of Russian markets - in violation of the Tilsit terms - by invading Russia. That ended in the catastrophic retreat from Moscow, which cost him more than half a million casualties and left his Grande Armee too vitiated to deter Austria and Prussia from joining his enemies Russia and Britain in 1813. Bar the Russian Invasion mistake (and I will concede that it was a hell of a mistake), Napoleon did not display the characteristics of a warmonger. Upon his return from exile, his charisma as a leader ensured he reclaimed the throne without shedding a drop of blood, as each army sent to fight him joined him immediately. When he was condemned by the allies in the Vienna Declaration, he wrote to them - \"After presenting the spectacle of great campaigns to the world, from now on it will be more pleasant to know no other rivalry than that of the benefits of peace, of no other struggle than the holy conflict of the happiness of peoples.\" You can argue that it was just posturing, but there is no precedent to suggest it was not genuine. He told his council that he had renounced any dream of reconstituting the empire and that \"henceforth the happiness and the consolidation\" of France \"shall be the object of all my thoughts.\" He refrained from taking measures against anyone who had betrayed him the previous year. \"Of all that individuals have done, written or said since the taking of Paris,\" he proclaimed, \"I shall forever remain ignorant.\" He immediately set about instituting a new liberal constitution incorporating trial by jury, freedom of speech and a bicameral legislature that curtailed some of his own powers; it was written by the former opposition politician Benjamin Constant, whom he had once sent into internal exile. He immediately set about refunding the art galleries and public buildings of Paris, in the 12 weeks before the war would begin. 3. Liberalism in the rest of Europe would have thrived. If Napoleon had remained emperor of France for the six years remaining in his natural life, European civilization would have benefited inestimably. The reactionary Holy Alliance of Russia, Prussia and Austria would not have been able to crush liberal constitutionalist movements in Spain, Greece, Eastern Europe and elsewhere; pressure to join France in abolishing slavery in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean would have grown; the benefits of meritocracy over feudalism would have had time to become more widely appreciated; Jews would not have been forced back into their ghettos in the Papal States and made to wear the yellow star again; encouragement of the arts and sciences would have been better understood and copied; and the plans to rebuild Paris would have been implemented, making it the most gorgeous city in the world. TL;DR - Napoleon was an all round great dude, and great leader who accomplished so much in such little time. If he had stayed in power for the 6 more years until his death, France and Europe would have benefitted greatly from it. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It was influenced mostly by [ this article ] , which is fascinating if you just fancy some historical version. Basically , if little corporal has won at Waterloo , and completed his conquest of Europe ( bar Russia , of course , and maybe England ) , the continent would have flourished economically , socially and politically , more so than now. I will highlight the primary points below. 1. Revolutionary domestic reform which all of Europe would have continued to benefit from. `` Yet he said he would be remembered not for his military victories , but for his domestic reforms , especially the Code little corporal , that brilliant distillation of 42 competing and often contradictory legal codes into a single , easily comprehensible body of French law. In fact , Napoleon 's years as first consul , from 1799 to 1804 , personify extraordinarily peaceful and productive. He also created the educational system based on lycees and grandes ecoles and the Sorbonne , which put France at the forefront of European educational accomplishment. He consolidate the administrative system based on departments and prefects. He initiated the Council of nation , which still vets the laws of France , and the Court of Audit , which oversees its public accounts. He organized the Banque de France and the horde d'Honneur , which thrive today. He also built or renovated much of the Parisian architecture that we even enjoy , both the useful - the quays along the Seine and four bridges over it , the sewers and reservoirs - and the beautiful , such as the Arc de Triomphe , the Rue de Rivoli and the Vendome column. `` napoleon was an extraordinary governor. Many of his reforms are what the rest of Europe found their institutions on , only much later. 2. Napoleon exist a lover , not a fighter.

{"original_text": "Let me preface this by saying I own Goldeneye 007 and have played it in both single and multiplayer. Neither particularly impressed me. Note that I don't blame Goldeneye's developers for this; they did the best they could with what they had at the time, and if you compare it to Duke Nukem 64 or SNES Doom it beats them by a landslide. Goldeneye was absolutely revolutionary for its time, and shaped the path of future FPS games. However, by today's standards, it is absolutely awful and is outclassed in literally every way by today's games. This is for a number of reasons, including mechanics, controls, and map variety. Despite this, many people choose to play Goldeneye, even though it is crap. It's not even moderately close-ish who wins between, say, Battlefield 4 or Goldeneye. However, since I know you guys are going to point out the massive price disparity between buying a PS3X360 with 4 controllers and an N64 with 4 controllers, I'm going to instead compare it with Timesplitters 2 on the PS2, which I believe to hold up far better today. A PS2 with 4 controllers and TS2 costs you 50 10x4 10 100. (Amazon prices) An N64 with 4 controllers and Goldeneye costs you 50 20x4 15 145. (Amazon prices) All of this is used. Let's first compare game mechanics. It makes sense that Goldeneye's game mechanics are less complex than Timesplitters 2's because the controller has fewer buttons. In Goldeneye you have the ability to do the following: aim, move, zoom in, fire, perform contextual actions, and switch weapons in one direction. Timesplitters 2 offers all of that as well as the ability to crouch and reload, as well as cycle backward and forward through your weapons. Of course, both of these games' mechanical complexities pale in comparison to today's FPS games, which add sprinting, jumping, and more. Next, controls. The N64's lack of dual analog makes the clear winner TS2. Other than that, they pretty much have the same control scheme. Props to Goldeneye for having more variety, but most of the variety is exceptionally poorly thought out schemes where moving and aiming are mixed between the C buttons and the analog stick. Finally, there is map variety. Due to the limitations of the N64, all of Goldeneye's maps are basically the same: completely indoor mazes of hallways and doors. Granted, there is much more variety than on most games of this type in that era, but compare this to TS2. You can CREATE YOUR OWN MAPS and many of the pre-created maps are outdoors. The maps also feel very different: the difference between Caves and Library is nothing compared to between Circus and Hangar, for instance. All these points are why I feel that Goldeneye 007 is a relic of the past and if you're looking for a multiplayer FPS experience you are better off looking elsewhere. In fact, other than \"because I played it as a kid,\" or \"because I own no consoles newer than the N64,\" I don't think there is any reason at all to play Goldeneye. CMV! Hello, users of CMV!

The American sporting fanbase has had to deal with a lot of this over the past 50 odd years with regards to football, and although this has slightly waned over the past 2 World Cups, I believe it is too late, and will now never be fully ingratiated into US sporting culture (compared to the classic sports). I believe the veiled snobbiness and general condescension from Euro football fans has contributed to this, but I also believe that the internet has created a 'Debate All Ad Nauseum' ethos which can be counterproductive to the growth of traditional hobbiesgamessports in a modern setting. So many articles like Why America Doesn't Like Soccer, And How That Can Be Changed' - Time Magazine] , [Is This Soccer's Moment in America? - WSJ] , and [Forget the World Cup Hype. America Will Never Embrace Soccer - LA Weekly] hinder a natural growth of interest in the history and traditions of football, which is a fundamental reason why the game is so popular. Who wants to be fed full of 'This could be popular because x viewer stats and of tweets per minute of the game', and then go look at Liverpool's success in the 80's? Nobody. Another reason is emotion. Being told to 'pick a side, pro football or anti football' creates an aura of national debate usually saved for Politics or Religion. Tarring a sport with this brush is a bad move, and does not help a casual fan from gradually falling in love with the game. It's a slow process, no-one transitions from knows-nothing to uberfan in a year. I believe a true love for a sport comes from following a team for a long period of time (thick and thin, ups and downs and all those lovely cliche) and wallowing in the success of others as a result of the time you personally have invested in a team. It's a slow and patient process.

{"original_text": "Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by rational means, rather than a mixture of reason, emotion, tradition, religion, evolutionary instinct etc. I will use one clear example, for the sake of focus, while knowing that there are other examples of this as well. I will talk about producing off-spring. In my experience, people against procreating articulate 3-4 arguments against having children. Firstly, that having children will detrimentally affect the environment (1). New humans means more consumers of the Earth's resources and more producers of waste. The long term viability of the earth with exponentially more consumers and producers is uncertain. Secondly, the cost of having children can be astronomical (2). Thirdly, you become isolated to your social circle and to your spouse due to the time need to take care of your child. I present these arguments not because they uniquely matter, but because they seem valid. They are, shall we say for the sake of argument, true. However, in the pursuit of being rational, these arguments have contradicted one of the most basic and scientific principles of life, namely that animals produce off-spring to survive. It is basic evolutionary biology. We observe this in every known creature; we observe our own instincts to sexual activity and pleasure; we observe people's special fondness to babies (3). Yet, despite this obvious teology of humans, the rational arguments are given preference. This seems to play out on the societal level. Education levels and industrialization (a proxy for culturerationality) correlate with lower birth rates (4).

{"original_text": "So I've been having a conversation with my 2 friends and we seem to have really different ideas. I'll explain the scenario and context. My friends I go to a local dive bar once or twice a week for dinner. We are friendly with the staff, we're pretty much regulars. In the past 2 months or so, there have been two situations that have caused me to feel disrespected directly or indirectly. The first time I let me frustration show and spoke to the offenders. The second time I let it go because my friends believe I need to grow out of confrontation. Scenario 1: I walk into the bar with my friend. We order our food and walk out onto the patio to meet some other people. As we walk, there is a table of 3 people around the same age as us (late 20s range). My friend is walking in front of me and as he passes these 3 people they make a derogatory remark about him, and begin to laugh and carry on. My friend, definitely heard this, but let it go. I couldn't. I stopped, turned around, and went up to the table and the following exchange happened. Me: \"What'd you say?\" , Random: \"Nothing\" , Me: \"You said something, what's so funny, why don't you say it again?\" , Random: \"No it was nothing\" , Me: \"You fucking sure about that?\" , Random: \"Yeah\" , Me: \"Yeah, that's what I thought....\" Now, it should be noted that I'm a rather large person. I'm 6 foot 3, 250 lbs, and I work out very vigorously. I know I can be intimidating, so most situations that are confrontational usually go about how this one went. My friend was pretty surprised that I did that. He knows I can be confrontational, but he is so opposite of me that it almost bothers him that I am like this. We talked about it and he told me that I need to stop doing things like that, not because of fear of getting hurt, but because learning to turn the other cheek is a very strong character trait, and I would benefit from it. I took his advice. Scenario 2: Same bar, weeks later, sitting at a table with the same friend from the previous story, but now we have 2 more male friends and 2 female friends with us. A drunk guy is walking back and forth in front of our table, really inappropriately staring at one of the girls with us and making little comments as he walks by. The 4th time this happens, he pretends to stumble and sorta grabs her arm and whispers something to her, that she clearly didn't like. I looked at my friend, he could see I was starting to get to a point where I was about to say something, but I didn't. The drunk guy went on with his night, I observed him the rest of the time we were there, and he did this to just about every woman at the bar or on the patio. It was really disgusting. So, I don't know if those scenarios were helpful or not but I wanted to give context as to why this was even a conversation within my social circle. My friend is of the belief that my pride is too inflated, and as a by product of that I am very confrontational. That might be true, I honestly haven't really sat and dug into it yet, but to me, it's just a matter of respect. I make it a point to never disrespect anybody who I don't know. I know that might sound weird, but IMO, if I don't know you, then I don't know what you deem to be respectful or not, so I'd rather be as respectful as I know how to be. I expect the same from other people. I'm sure everyone can agree that you should try to respect people, but what about someone who is a habitually disrespectful? Don't we have a duty, in a way, to police this as a society. Isn't holding people accountable for their misdeeds important? Is me confronting someone for making myself and my friend uncomfortable for now reason, with no provocation inappropriate of me? I know it's not my 'job' or my 'duty' to be the pillar of respect and morals in my community. But, when someone who blatantly rude to me or my friends, I feel a very strong desire to right the wrong, and inform the offender that the behavior is unacceptable. Am I off base here?

{"original_text": "There's a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote, or accepting anything for a vote. The spirit of this law is that the vote should be your own, informed choice, rather than letting someone else make the decision for you.

I've seen a few videos on the internet of cops dancing at block parties or playing a short round of cards in a park but none have gone viral like [this video] of an NYPD officer dancing at the NYC LGBT pride parade this past weekend. The general consensus is polarized; some people like myself are perfectly fine, even happy, that some officers are finding enjoyment and positive interactions with civilians in their day-to-day work rather than hostility and aggression; others feel that this interaction was completely unprofessional and that the officer should be fired or at least punished. I believe that the officer shouldn't face any punishment for simply dancing with a civilian for less than 20 seconds at a parade with clearly no imminent threat or danger present. My logic behind this is that many officers won't be punished for using excessive force or even wrongfully killing someone, so why should an officer be punished for taking 20 seconds to dance with a friendly civilian at a parade.

My logic behind this is that many officers wo n't be punished for using excessive force or even wrongfully killing someone , so why should an ships officer be punished for taking 20 seconds to dance with a friendly civilian at a parade. Even if we lived in a world where excessively violent officers were rightfully punish , I would still be angry if this cop were to be punish for dancing at a parade. howdy , users of CMV !

{"original_text": "I need to preface my thoughts initially by saying that holding this view does not mean I devalue cheerleading in any way. I have attended competitions, and known several friends who cheerlead, and though I am a very active, physically fit person, I would still find it challenging to learn and execute many moves in cheerleading, and find it impressive and enjoyable to watch. However, I don't consider it a sport. This is not a pejorative assertion, but even so, I have experienced pushback for it in the past. I also don't subscribe to the Olympic definition of sport. In my view, a sport needs to be able to be won by objective means. That is to say, you need to have a goal that can be reached: make it to a certain point first, score more points, lift the most weight, etc. Obviously, officials make wrong calls, and goals in hockeysoccer for instance are wrongly disallowedwrongly given occasionally, but at the end of the day, there is still an objective resultoutcome, but for the number of games they decide on the merit of the mistake alone, I'm willing to consider them a reasonable minority. Team A 4 - 3 Team B, Usain Bolt wins race with time of 9.68 seconds, etc. I believe events decided solely by judges cannot be sports, and will always be subjective in nature. Sports like boxing, with judging elements, are still sports in my view because there is an objective way to win - knocking the opponent out so they cannot respond to a 10 count, for instance. The judging is a tiebreaker, and I am fine with that. But in judge-only events, an identical routine could win one contest, and lose another, simply by virtue of human subjectivity alone. For this reason, I lump cheerleading in with figure skating, diving, and other events as athletic activities. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Last Sunday John Oliver's show dealt with this subject and chastised the US for being only one of two developed countries in the world without maternity leave that is paid for by the taxpayers. Here is a link to watch it if you haven't seen it yet: Here is the gist of my viewpoint: In the US, when a person is terminated from a job, heshe is entitled to unemployment benefits for up to 99 weeks or until they are employed again. Workers and companies pay into this and, while many people end up taking more than they give, it is the system we have and it seems to work for the majority of people here. When a person leaves a job VOLUNTARILY, however, they are not entitled to unemployment benefits. If you quit a job to go to another job this is fine. If you are quitting to go'find' yourself in Australia for a year, you better have a financial plan because you can't live off other peoples' money for your vacation. This system also seems to work well for most people. In the US, abortion is Constitutionally protected under a person's right to privacy. The details of the laws vary from state to state but there is no place in the US where a person cannot legally and safely obtain an abortion during the first six months of pregnancy.

We have safety nets for people who are caught in situations they can't control. This is not one of them. Being a parent requires the ability to plan and budget anyway, and it includes many expenses that people will absolutely incur that will not be covered by the hard work of others. It should start with planning to be off work for whatever time having the baby takes. I completely support peoples' positions being protected while they are off and, quite honestly, think that length of time should be extended from 12 weeks to 24 weeks. But I REALLY don't like the idea of taxpayer dollars being used to support ANYONE who voluntarily leaves work - no matter the reason. Change My View. EDIT: I am also against he government mandating that companies provide paid maternity leave on simple Constitutional grounds. In the US the Constitution prohibits the government from mandating this.

It's a disability that is completely avoidable, and I think for these reason people don't like to classify it as a disability.

I definitely have my share of tourist visas in my passport , and I could n't imagine jumping though the hoops my nation requires for a visa. I own n't heard of any other country that requires an interview for most tourist visa applications. I have heard that sion can be pretty strict going in , but I 've entered sion 3 times without being stopped for an interview ( leaving , however , was strangely a problem ).

{"original_text": "Consent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved that what they're doing, and how they're doing it, is okay with their partner (s). Consent also allows for things that would otherwise be creepy or weird to come into a positive light and expressed in a healthy way. I would consider the act of objectifying to fall under this category. For example, a woman may be creeped out if a dude right in front of her at a party is just staring at her boobs without any concern for her at all. The same act of staring at the boobs is 100 fine if it's with her boyfriend while they're having consensual sexual relations. If we take this same line of logic of consent that happens with sex and put it with masturbation, that's where I'm going with this. If you're thinking about another person in a sexual manner without them knowing about it, and then acting out that thought process by masturbating, it just seems a bit creepy to me. If I'm not allowed to objectify or do other sexual acts in person without having consent from the other person, I don't see how that wouldn't also translate over to masturbation. It's the same sexual thoughts, feelings, and intentions with the only difference being that the partner is not physically with you. Because they're not there with you, you can't ask for proper consent unless you physically ask them some other time if you can masturbate about them. This line of thought has logic to it, but it's a conclusion that I don't like to face. This line of thought potentially makes masturbation an awful act if done without consent. It also makes it an act that wouldn't be allowed if no one gave any consent to you. You might be able to say that pornography that was paid for might be consensual masturbation because the model is being paid, and is therefore willing to consent to you masturbating. Even so, this doesn't allow you to explore your sexual desires outside of straight up porn unless someone says it's okay. If you asked me whether I'm for or against masturbation, I would say that I'm very pro-masturbation. The act has health benefits, relieves stress, is pleasurable, and all sorts of other fun goodies. It makes it so I don't want to come to the conclusion that I've come to that it needs strict consent about the person (s) that's involved in one's fantasies. So please, CMV! EDIT: After reading over the many replies I've gotten (thank you all) I think my view has already sufficiently changed. Consent with masturbation has more of a tendency to be harmful than helpful and positive. There's a difference between one's thoughts and actions, and masturbation causes no harm if the one being fantasied about isn't informed. There was also the argument that ones thoughts and fantasies should be their own, and no one else's. Control of your own thoughts is a human necessity, and putting a limit on them could be hazardous. As long as I keep a mental image of someone in tact of who they are, and not just seeing them as a sex object, I think it's all fine and dandy. Thanks guys.

{"original_text": "First off, let me clearly define what I'm going to be talking about. I'm referring to parking spots in a car park, NOT parallel parking on streets. Backing in reversing into the spot. Pulling in driving head on into the spot. Backing out reversing out of the spot when you're leaving the premises. When parking in a car park, you have two options: 1. Back into the spot when you're entering the carpark. Drive straight out when you're leaving . 2. Pull straight into the spot when you're entering the carpark. Back out of the spot when you're leaving. In my personal driving experience (little under 4 years so not that much), I have found backing into parking spots to be infinitely easier than backing out. Unless someone is a dick and is tailgating you when you're trying to back into the spot, you generally have unobstructed vision as you reverse. If you are skilled, and know how to use your side mirrors (!), then backing into the spot can be generally done in 2 quick moves without needing any further adjustments to straighten the car. On the other hand, backing out of spots is problematic as you need to make sure that there are no oncoming cars, and your vision to check this is obstructed by the car parked adjacent to you. More often than not, you will need to inch your car slowly backwards as you make sure no cars are oncoming. And god forbid if you're unlucky enough to have a 4WD parked next to you. Furthermore, I've found pulling straight into a spot to be more difficult than one would seem. Maybe it's because I drive a SUV and my mirrors are inadequately placed, since I can barely see the lines on the ground when I'm driving straight on. But I can very visibly see the lines when I'm reversing. So, the issue here is that when parking in a carpark, either the entry or exit is easy peasy, while the other is \"difficult.\" Maybe in an alternate universe, someone can invent a carpark layout such that both entry and exit of a spot are trivial. But right now, it seems that the \"backing in\" option is easier at both the \"easy\" and \"difficult\" maneuvers. It's easier to pull out than to pull in, and it's easier to back in than to back out. If everyone started to \"back in\" when they're at carparks, then it would be more efficient as a whole. Now I personally see 2 issues with my conclusion (trying to be as unbiased as I can here!): Firstly, in this example [here] and if you look at the red car, you can see that heshe has pulled into the spot. However, as there is no car in the spot \"in front\" of the red car, the red car can simply pull out of the spot when heshe chooses to leave. Hence in this case, there is no difficult driving maneuver required. But my counter to this would be that you cannot bank on this happening oftenly, unless the carpark you are visting is not a very busy one. Secondly, for the less skilled drivers, both backing in and out would be difficult and time consuming. However, depending on the customs of whatever country you're in, oncoming drivers may be accustomed to having right of way when someone is backing out of a spot. Hence the lack of skill of some drivers would not be a detriment to others. On the other hand, if a less skillful driver is trying to back into a spot, oncoming drivers will have to wait for the parking driver to finish before they can go on their way. Despite these two points I just discussed, I still think that the backing in option is much more efficient than pulling in. The world would be a much better place if everyone backed into parking spots. Please CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"original_text": "This has nothing to do with the celebration of Christmas excluding religious minorities, it's because traditional nativity scenes reinforce negative stereotypes about Jews. As the story goes, when Jesus was about to be born his parents were travelling to Bethlehem, but when they got there the inn was full, so Mary had to give birth in the barn. The problem is, if nativity scenes are any indication, baby Jesus was still in the manger when the three wise men came to visit and give him Christmas presents. Most people know Jesus was born on Christmas, but less realize that the wise men didn't show up until the Epiphany twelve days later. Are we honestly expected to believe that no vacancies opened up at the inn for almost two weeks? Because that would be the most unbelievable aspect of the entire story if you ask me, and it seriously strains credulity to begin with. Even miracles make more sense in the context of the birth of the Son of God. Maybe a virgin really could give birth to a deity, or a new star could magically appear over the birthplace, but there's no reason for the inn to miraculously have no rooms come open for nearly two weeks. Plus Mary and Joseph would be the first to know when something came available since they were basically squatting in the garage and would surely notice when patrons came to get their ox or camel or whatever before leaving. The obvious implication is that Jesus' chintzy Jewish stepdad was such a tightwad that he was willing to let his pubescent wife and her newborn baby sleep in donkey slop if it would save him a few shekels. Joseph probably would have made that barn the family's permanent rent-free residence if the wise men hadn't showed up bearing enough cash and prizes to go live it up in Egypt. After all, why did they stay so long anyway? It's not like Mary needed the time to recuperate. Thanks to baby Jesus' healing powers even her hymen immediately regenerated, kind of like the redhead vampire from True Blood or the cheerleader from Heroes.

There is a difference between rights granted by law and natural rights. Laws can define where natural rights are legally applicable. But laws can't give or take away inherentnatural rights. (Laws can, however, violate or protect those rights.) There still must be a logical derivation of this right from nature if it exists.

Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated. I actually think guns are the least of our problems, and I'm not really a \"gun-grabber\" because there are a couple dozen things I'd rather do first. (And if those happen, guns would mostly only be used for hunting, and target practice. And the potential for a strong national defence, like they ought to be.)

To be clear: I could give a about gun rights, I don't see any logical derivation of those rights from nature. So far as I can see they are only legal rights and not natural rights at all. At the same time, people who actually spend effort and time opposing gun rights annoy me, because (duh) there will always be weapons and violence until people get healthy and free. focusing actions on a wedge issue like guns serves to divide, and sow fear, rather than to unify and bring progress. Discussion, though, is another matter. I am currently against both \"gun grabbers\" (practically) and gun rights (ideologically). So I am mostly heavily neutral on this subject.

{"original_text": "It seems like most people around us at least own a TV. I have not touched TV for at least a year, and when I do it is usually very brief. If I do not have a TV now, I cannot find any excuse to it. I find TV useless when one could afford a computer with decent internet connection. Why? Let me list my reasons. 1. TV alone cannot do everything PC can, and PC can do almost everything TV can. Sure you could watch sport on TV, but you could do the same on internet. Sure you could watch news on TV, but you could watch those same channels on internet, and have other choices such as blogs. Those movie and TV show are available on PC from providers like Netflix, while other extremly popular medias available on computer like YouTube are not available on normal TV. Smart TVs have them, but they cost more than regular TV, and you may as well buy a decent computer. 2. TVs are poor substitute for computer monitor. I could buy a decent 1440p 27 inch PLS monitor like this: Or I could spend similar amount of money for 720p 32 inch TVs like these: BestBuy may not always be the best place to buy TV, but you still can't get a better monitor replacement with another 100: Other than that, there are other more technical problems to use TV as monitor replacement, and we could discuss it on request. 3. Gaming quality on computer is at least on par with TV, if not better. I don't want to stir up another war of PC vs Console, but I think it is safe to say PC could provide similar gaming quality at the same cost as console. In addition, PC have more choices such as MMO and upgrade potential. This means people could pay more on PC to get a premium experience, while consoles only offer its potential in a very narrow price range. If a person own a decent TV, there is a good chance that he also own a computer. Buying a decent graphic card as an upgrade is not really more expensive than buying a console, and the TV itself cost separately. Again, I will elaborate on this upon request. 4.TVs are not mobile, while laptops are. Even if they are, things like chromebook defeat their purpose. 5. Computers don't really cost more. If you pay for TV channels, then you could pay for internet. I personally find internet more important than the latter. As well, you get could still get access to those shows with internet. As stated in point 2 and 3, TVs are not really that much cost effective either. What is the point of TV now?

Sure you could watch news on TV , but you could watch those same epithelial duct on internet , and have other choices such as blogs. Those movie and TV show are available on PC from providers like Netflix , while other extremly pop medias available on computer like YouTube are not available on normal TV. smarting TVs have them , but they cost more than regular TV , and you may as well buy a decent computer. 2. TVs are poor backup man for computer monitor. I could buy a decent 1440p 27 inch PLS monitoring device like this : Or I could spend similar amount of money for 720p 32 inch TVs like these : BestBuy may not always be the best place to buy TV , but you still ca n't get a better monitoring device replacement with another 100 : Other than that , there are other more technical problems to use TV as monitoring device replacement , and we could discuss it on request. 3. game quality on computer is at least on par with TV , if not better. I do n't want to stir up another war of PC pentad Console , but I think it is safe to say PC could provide similar gaming quality at the same cost as console. In addition , PC have more choices such as MMO and upgrade voltage. This means people could pay more on PC to get a premium experience , while consoles only offer its potential in a very narrow leontyne price range. If a person own a decent TV , there is a good chance that he also possess a computer. Buying a decent graphic card as an upgrade is not really more expensive than buying a console , and the idiot box itself cost separately. Again , I will complicate on this upon request. 4. TVs follow not mobile , while laptops follow. Even if they are , matter like chromebook defeat their purpose. 5. Computers do n't really cost more. If you pay for telly channels , then you could pay for internet. I personally find internet more of import than the latter. As intimately , you get could still get access to those shows with internet. As stated in point 2 and 3 , video are not really that much cost effective either. What is the point of boob tube now ? Edit : View change : boob tube is useful for a group of people , and especially in a family with young child. View change : TV is not in peril of rapid decline in at least a few years. ", "label": 1}

Anyway, some of the terms that come to mind are Agender and Androgynous. The mean the same thing, to not identify as any gender, so why are they two separate words?

I'm also not entirely sure why people can't just dress the way they want to while remaining whatever sex they were given at birth. Does it really matter if a man dresses as a woman? Does he really have to be classified as gender-fluid because it really just seems like a word that would be less blunt than cross-dressing.

{"original_text": "I believe that we are at the point where we potentially could avoid bringing about catastrophic climate change, but to do that we would need to drop absolutely everything, to change our lifestyles in the most dramatic of ways, and we would need to unify and mobilize everybody to address this issue (at the expense of almost everything else). And I believe that it's too late for us to do this because it would take changes so dramatic that the people who are most invested in society as it is today (the rich and powerful) would resist it will everything they have. A lack of serious committments and changes is indicative of this. I believe that we are on the brink of a number of tipping points, if we haven't already passed them: The melting of the polar ice caps (including rain at polar areas and the landslide effect of snowmelt destabilizing ice sheets causing them to break up plunge into the ocean well before they would even melt) meaning that the sheets which used to reflect sunlight away from the Earth will be gone. Along with that is the albedo flip where as the ice melts and pools of water accumulate on the top of ice sheets, they become a sort of heatsink, absorbing solar energy and causing nearby ice to melt, creating further pools of water. The melting of frozen methane escaping into the atmosphere is a similar effect which will cause another feedback loop as methane is a much more effective greenhouse gas, in orders of magnitude (is it 40x?) above carbon dioxide. Oceanic acdification threatening to grind not only oxygen production to a virtual standstill but also threatening to destroy the very foundation of oceanic life by removing the ability for the cornerstone of the oceanic foodchain, phytoplankton, to form. If this happens, then the natural cycle of nutrients from the oceans to the waterways back to the land will come to a grinding halt, meaning that the once rich and fertile liminal lands along coastlines will become barren and waterways will end up eutrophying and becoming undrinkable. The destruction of peat bogs andor the reduction of the capacity of peat bogs to keep the carbon they contain sequestered. Runaway forest fires causing feedback loops as the hotter and drier the world gets, the more likely severe forest fires will be which will in turn increase the carbon in the atmosphere. The potential for rainforest ecosystems to collapse thereby increasing atmospheric carbon while ceasing to function as carbon sinks. Desertification rapidly increasing due to increased temperatures and reducederratic rainfall thereby reducing plant life and the ability for ecosystems to absorb carbon dioxide. The potential for climate change to affect the ability of cloud formation and water vapor to reflect sunlight. But the biggest factor in all of this, and the one tipping point which we have already passed is this one the social tipping point. (Granted this is hypothetical and I admit that it's difficult to argue against speculation and prognostication.) What I see as the social tipping point is the part where people stop caring because they feel entirely powerless to affect any change, where governments choose not to act for leverage (politicalfinancial etc.), where governments and corporations choose not to act in order to preserveincrease profits, where the food supply gets put under more pressure due changes in climate (extremes, predictability, rainfall etc.) and so people will be less interested in eating locally or sustainably and more interested in just trying to get enough food, where electricity usage will skyrocket as people try to maintain a comfortable temperature indoors while it's either baking or freezing outside, where we will be faced with increasingly severe humanitarian crises (water shortages, coastal flooding, islands being submerged, famines etc.), where wars over resources will only increase, and the sum of these social feedback loops will cripple our ability to focus on ways to address runaway climate change because we will be dealing with other more urgent issues that cannot be ignored. The reason that I believe we have passed this so-called social tipping point is because collectively we have not only failed to halt carbon emissions, but instead we have only been increasing them. If there were hope for us to achieve serious change in order to avert catastrophic climate change, it would be indicated by the countries of the world rallying to make carbon emissions simply plateau. But we can't even do that. So I believe that it's too late for the world to not only stop the increase of carbon emissions, but that it's too late to be able to bring about the dramatic changes in lifestylesliving standards etc. required to avoid either increasing carbon emissions (which is a catastrophe) or simply halting carbon emissions where they are right now (which is a catastrophe). And I think that as we have surpassed this social tipping point, it will cause feedback loops in society as well as in the environment which will push us increasingly faster down a path of catastrophic climate change. N.B.: I'm not saying that humans are fundamentally incapable of changing the way they live their lives and their environmental impact. I'm not saying that life will be extinguished altogether, in fact I'm not even saying that humans as a species won't survive, but I'm saying that our societies and our progress almost certainly will not survive. I'm not saying that if we all pulled together and put everything we had into averting catastrophic climate change we couldn't stop it. I'm not saying that a revolution that sweeps the globe and changes the fundamental nature of the way society organizes itself around production, consumption, and our relation to the environment couldn't stop this. And I'm not saying that there won't be the potential for some miracle techno-fix that will save everything in the eleventh hour. I'm saying that for us to have anything more than the most infinitesimally small chance that we might be able to save ourselves from climate change somehow that we would need to have already made big strides on this front, and the way that the world is geared means that we are effectively stuck barrelling towards catastrophic climate change in an ever-accelerating manner and that this is demonstrated by us not being able to put the brakes on now, and that's without even trying to put it into reverse (to overstretch the metaphor).

Because being surrounded by smart, healthy, educated people obviously has nothing to do with my own wellbeing. It's a purely private, economic affair s Capitalism and our educational system teach people not to look out for one another unless they get paid for it, because we are trained to live in individualistic thought bubbles in which the happiness and wellbeing of every other person on the planet has nothing to do with our own.

{"original_text": "I believe that health \"insurance\" in this country is grossly overused and distorts the very idea of insurance. By definition, insurance is a form of calculated risk management, in which the consumer is hedged against unforeseen losses in the event of an emergency of catastrophe. For example, people have auto insurance to cover the damages incurred during car collisions or other accidents on the road (whether or not purchasing auto insurance should be compulsory is another argument in and of itself). Events like these are unexpected and do not happen regularly for drivers; if they did, insurers would either a) raise insurance premiums to account for the increased risk, or b) deny coverage altogether if they deemed the risk was too high. What auto insurance companies do not do, however, is cover the costs of maintenance operations such as changing your tiresoilbrakes, or smog checks. If they had to foot the bill (or at least part of it) every time people did these things, they would be forced to raise premiums in order to maintain profitability. When it comes to health insurance, however, insurers often have to bear some of the cost for everything ranging from a simple doctor's visit to things like massage therapychiropractic care (at least some plans do). I think that because health insurance is overused beyond what its purpose (see 1st paragraph) should be, that healthcare costs continue to rise and are getting out of control (whether to policyholders of private insurance, or taxpayers in countries that have a single-payer system in place). In accordance with the definition of insurance, it should really be limited to coverage in the event of real health emergencies like cardiac arrest, septic shock, injury resulting from a car accident, etc. As a result of this, in the US it's common for insurance providers to place limits on their policyholders (limiting the number of doctor visits, which drugs they cover, etc) and what doctors cancannot do. I work in a hospital and see this very often. I'm not defending the health insurance industry or its practices, just trying to rationalize [at least part of] why this cost problem exists. When politicians or people talk about the \"uninsured\" or trying to mandate coverage, I think they're only doing favors for the insurance companies and not doing anything to help the patients or the healthcare providers. I'm not arguing for getting rid of health insurance entirely, but I think it should be limited in its use, and not arbitrarily expanded to cover everybody or every medical condition. I believe it has its place in protecting people against legitimate medical emergencies like the ones I stated above, and it should be used in such circumstances. For the majority of healthcare needs though, such as routine visits to the doctor's office or care, I think a better alternative is the use of health savings accounts (HSAs). If we take health insurance companies out of the picture, and stop requiring employers to provide coverage (the cost of which is withheld from their employees' salaries), people will have more choices when it comes to their healthcare and won't be burdened by the arbitrary decisions insurance companies have to make for them. Of course there will be those people who would rather use that additional money towards other things, but most people would agree that regardless of their current state of health, having a health insurance in case shit hits the fan would be a \"smart\" thing to do. Naturally, the downside is that there is going to be a rather large disparity in costs to individuals, as some people have pre-existing conditions that make them higher-risk and more expensive to insure in the long run (i.e. you are diabetic, overweightobese, are a smoker, etc).

{"original_text": "First of all, I want to say that there is room in this discussion for personal preference. Obviously music enjoyment is not some scientific enterprise. There is music that I don't enjoy listening to, but understand how others could or see quality that I can appreciate. Likewise, everyone has those guilty pleasure artistssongs where we know they're bad, but love them anyway. In either case, there is something about the music that we find good, whether an infectious melody or well-constructed lyrics or a wailing solo. Which returns me to trap. I find nothing about it aesthetically or musically appealing. I can't relegate it to \"I'm not into it, but can see why others do\" because I can't see why others like it, which is why I turn to you, Reddit. My objections are as follows: (1) Minimalism works against it. Minimalism in music is not always bad. I listen to other Electrohouse or DnB artists who use it to great effect. It creates a great tension-and-release element to a song and when used well is orgasmic. This tension is a staple in the Trap \"sound,\" replacing the forceful Dubstep drop for a super low drone with a high minimalistic melody (generally speaking). On an subjective level, this is musical blue balls, but I think I can make a case for this on a more objective level. The reason the EDM staple of build-drop works is because of the tension-release cycle. It's like those amusement park rides that take you up 300 feet and then, well, drop you. The exhilaration and force of the drop is sharpened by the slow buildup. Trap, on the other hand, employs an almost identical build, and then the contrasted lack of sound at the drop serves as a different kind of experience. Imagine if instead of dropping the full 300 feet, the ride drops you 50 feet. You dont expect the stop and theres this juxtaposition of released tension and even more anticipation. Trap as a genre embraces this latter example as its core, never rleasing the tension fully. As a result, instead of effectively building a proper tension-release cycle, Trap leaves the listener unfulfilled. Possible rebuttal to (1): The amusement park model doesn't work for Trap. In that case, what is a better model with which to consider Trap? (2) Absence of complexity. I'm not looking for Mozart the DJ. Just something that gives the illusion of compositional knowhow. 1-3 note melodies are firstly boring and secondly a sign that the producer has no musical talent. I would like skill in my music. Trap as a genre feeds the instrumental-fetishist argument that electrobic music takes no skill because they don't play a \"real instrument.\" EDM can do so much more, and I've heard it do so much more. Just never in this genre. Possible rebuttal to (2): (a) You're just being a snob and using it as an excuse for your subjective dislike. Possibly, but I don't think so. Even if the bar were set really low (like One Direction low) maybe the best choruses of Trap (that are distinctly Trap, not simply elements of other EDM genres which automatically set the majority of trap above 1D) could surpass them in terms of quality. Maybe. (b) Other genres have plenty of unremarkable musical complexity. Agreed; however no genre (aside from Ambient Drone) makes melodic simplicity a defining feature of the genre itself. (c) Simplicity is not always bad. Agreed. Some composers use simplicity very well and for a variety of aesthetic effects. My argument is that Trap does not.

Obviously music enjoyment comprise not some scientific enterprise. There is music that I do n't revel listening to , but understand how others could or see quality that I can appreciate. as well , everyone has those guilty pleasure artistssongs where we know they 're bad , but love them anyway. In either case , there is something about the music that we find honest , whether an infectious melody or well-constructed lyrics or a wailing solo. Which returns me to pin. I find nothing about it aesthetically or musically attract. I ca n't relegate it to `` I 'm not into it , but can see why others do '' because I ca n't see why others like it , which follow why I turn to you , Reddit. My objections follow as follows : ( 1 ) Minimalism works against it. Minimalism in medicine is not always bad. I listen to other Electrohouse or DnB creative person who use it to great effect. It creates a great tension-and-release element to a strain and when used well is orgasmic. This tension is a staple in the Trap `` sound , '' replacing the forceful Dubstep drop for a super low drone with a high minimalistic line ( generally speaking ). On an subjective level , this is musical blue balls , but I think I can have a case for this on a more objective level. The rationality the EDM staple of build-drop works is because of the tension-release cycle. It 's like those amusement park rides that take you up 300 feet and then , well , dip you. The exhilaration and force of the fall is sharpened by the slow buildup. ambuscade , on the other hand , employs an almost identical build , and then the contrasted lack of sound at the drop serves as a different kind of experience. Imagine if instead of dropping the full 300 feet , the ride set down you 50 feet. You dont wait the stop and theres this juxtaposition of released tension and even more anticipation. Trap as a genre embraces this latter example as its core , neer rleasing the tension fully. As a result , instead of in effect building a proper tension-release cycle , Trap leaves the listener unfulfilled. Possible rebuttal to ( 1 ) : The amusement park model does n't work for cakehole. In that slip , what is a better model with which to consider Trap ? ( 2 ) Absence of complexity. I 'm not wait for Mozart the DJ. Just something that gives the illusion of compositional knowhow. 1-3 note melodies are firstly boring and secondly a sign that the manufacturer has no musical talent. I would wish skill in my music. Trap as a musical genre feeds the instrumental-fetishist argument that electrobic music takes no skill because they do n't play a `` real instrument. `` EDM can do and so much more , and I 've heard it do and so much more. exactly never in this genre. Possible rebuttal to ( 2 ) : ( a ) You 're just being a snot and using it as an excuse for your subjective dislike. perhaps , but I do n't think so. Even if the bar were set really low ( like One Direction low ) maybe the best choruses of Trap ( that are distinctly Trap , not simply elements of other EDM genres which automatically set the majority of trap above 1D ) could surpass them in terms of caliber. perhaps. ( b ) Other genres have plenty of everyday musical complexity. Agreed ; however no genre ( aside from Ambient Drone ) makes melodic simplicity a defining lineament of the genre itself. ( speed of light ) Simplicity is not always bad. consort. Some composers use simplicity very well and for a variety of aesthetic force. My argument equal that Trap does not. It 's likely that I wo n't savour Trap music after this thread , but I do want to understand those that do like it , and if they like it , whether they actually think it constitutes quality music.

{"original_text": "Lets start by looking at a situation: Imagine you are walking by a shallow river on your way to a ball when you see a child drowning. You're wearing some pretty expensive clothes (lets say 500 pounds) that will no doubt be ruined if you jump into the river. Saving this child doesn't put you in danger as you can stand in this river while the child being smaller cannot. Do you jump into that river to save that child? Let's say you encounter that same river with a different child in it the next day while wearing your rolex watch. Do you jump into that river to save the child? Now lets look at the real world. More than 1.3 billion people live in extreme poverty (less than 80p a day) and 7.6 million children are estimated to have died before their 5th birthday in 2010. Many of these are from poverty, preventable diseases and illnesses. Money can help provide infrastructure for schools, hospitals, sanitation facilities, vaccinations etc which no doubt will help reduce child mortality rates. Once you look at the world through this lens then it is easy enough to look at the world in terms of opportunity cost. This iphone or 100 life saving vaccinations. An expensive house or cheap government housing and a new well providing water for a village. One may argue that there is a difference between the example and this and that is distance. These children are much further away but I don't see how that dilutes your moral responsibility to them. Therefore, it seems that any money that you keep must be worth a child's life, education etc or be allocated to some other duty such as child rearing where you have a responsibility to give time and money (for schools, healthcare etc) to make sure that your child grows up to be a socially productive member of society. I know that sounds like a very cold perspective on what parenting is about but I couldn't think of another way to phrase it haha. I will assume that most people think that you should save the child but this specifically is why I would save the child. I'm looking at this from the stance of virtue ethics (Aquinas) and I believe that by allowing this child to die shows a lack of charity and isn't positively building character. I can't justify losing a life in exchange for 500 pounds. But, I think even taken from the stance of consequentialism (believing that consequences should inform your moral thinking) or deontological ethics (believing that laws inform your moral stance) you would still reach the eventual conclusion that you must jump into that river: Consequentialism (i.e. Utilitarianism): You would have to argue that having 500 pounds will lead to greater pleasurehappiness than that life and I don't think you can justify that. Deontological ethics (i.e. Kant): I only really understand Kant so he's the one that I will briefly (very briefly) talk about but allowing that child to die breaks the categorical imperative as if you allowed that act to become universal you would be devaluing human life by saying that it has a price tag. I've only briefly talked about why I think the child should be saved as I take it as a assumption that most people would save the child but I will be willing to discuss my ethical stance more thoroughly if anyone asks me about it but I didn't want my post to only appeal to those who have studied philosophy.

{"original_text": "A friend and I were talking about the current candidates and she couldn't understand why Trump was doing so well in the polls. The best I could articulate it is that he is the most populist candidate out, his politics are moderate but heavily nationalist, his demeanor is one of our idealized archetypes, and he is wealthy but appears genuine, achieving a halo effect (unlike Romney.) After realizing this, I asked several other people, and realized that basically my friends, like Clinton, don't like how he communicates, but then have no major disagreement with the content. Am I missing something? Is there a good reason to dismiss him as a candidate? More importantly, who is real competition for him? EDIT From todays conversations: I see an argument for why he may not have a good chance in an election (delta awarded), mainly in that whatever percentage of his 25 popularity is republican is all he may get from the republicans, and as a more mainstream candidate arises, the split votes wont go to him (that is, the people who polled for him may be all that would poll for him in the primary, given any other more mainstream republican candidate. However, I have seen no compelling argument for why he is not a populist candidate. Some have tried to narrow the definition of a populist to being representative of a position or policies that in some fashion clearly serve the underserve orand the majority, but this is difficult to define, and ignores the perception. One person argued at length that the self perception of the constituency as victim and the candidate's policy being to address that sense of victimization is what makes them populist, and while I can agree that it is a fine definition, the person then asserts that this is not trump, and I disagree, as Trump clearly paints the American people as victimized by poor, self interested leadership, a corrupt political culture, and compromised ideas and strategies, and his entire platform is about going in as a normal private citizen and fixing it. Many (most?) have simply tried to argue that he is too insulting to win, but I remain unconvinced that that would stop a sizable percentage of Americans from voting for him. This is because Americans don't actually value formality and decorum as much as power and conviction. For the same reason that this is the America we have, I can't see how a candidate, fundamentally in favor of current nationalist policies, but simultaneously harping on being free from big money interests and the many leadership deficits that are frustrating Americans, isn't hitting so many of the right cords with mainstream America. If he sticks to a policy (rather than sentiment,) that is antithetical to a group, then another would be preferred by that group. But a career politician vs Trump, both speaking in vagaries, I see Trump coming out on top rather consistently.

This is because Americans do n't actually value formalities and decorum as much as power and conviction. For the same reason that this is the America we have , I ca n't see how a candidate , fundamentally in favor of current nationalist policies , but at the same time harping on being free from big money interests and the many leadership deficits that are frustrating Americans , is n't hitting so many of the right cords with mainstream America. If he sticks to a policy ( rather than view , ) that is antithetical to a group , then another would be preferred by that group. But a career politician vs Trump , both speaking in vagaries , I see Trump descend out on top rather consistently. ( Saw a headline today , Trump took a hit in polls for being in favor of higher taxes , this looks like an example of the identical thing. ) hello , users of CMV !

{"original_text": "EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one of the larger roadblocks I'm running into in is distinguishing between identity, behavior, and biology. Because of how closely linked they are I was willing to concede non-heterosexuality encompassing orientations pretty much from the beginning. However I'm also stubbornly holding on to the idea that historically, heterosexual behaviors have been encouraged and any orientation that would facilitate them would be selected for. From there, I concluded that heterosexuality and bisexuality would be the two most likely sexualities to be propagated (by some abstracted gene selection process) but didn't understand why the more restrictive option would be selected for over the less restrictive one. The answer seems to be hiding in probabilities so if anyone can expand on that more I'm willing to give deltas. Also, if you have a problem with my reasoning, please leave an explanation with your downvote so I can understand why it's off. I struggle to believe that most human beings are naturally supposed to only be attracted to the opposite sex and are inherently repulsed by same sex characteristics. I think most people identify as straight out of convenience and having never needed to question what was assumed for them. I'm not denying that heterosexuality is a legitimate orientation but I have not found convincing evidence against, for example, the possibility that most humans could be predisposed to bisexuality and simply develop a preference of one or none from there. The only arguments I've read for heterosexuality being default is the biological urge to have children, which I believe is neither universal nor exclusive to heterosexuality and the (imo fallacious) \"most people are straight so there must be a biological mechanism that supports this phenomenon\" path of reasoning.

{"original_text": "With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned in that way everything seemed to go more or less fine (of course there were others interspersed but that was the majority of viewpoints). As more and more groups began to be introduced there were shall we say competing interests. They correctly are asking for space within the community as well. However, the problem is White men had already kind of adopted this space as a place where they could discuss their problems without feeling guilty etc. For example, when people complain about false rape charges getting to the front page constantly or reverse discrimination cases etc etc. I think the SJW this and that we often see is just pushback from White Men feeling \"invaded\" for lack of a better word. I'm not saying this is right. I think this last ush of banning subs etc also has the same implications first FatPeopleHate is seen as appealing to women and feminists. Then Coontown seen as appealing to minorities. I think its reflective of White Men feeling like all other people get to have their spaces etc. but they never do. What I got from the threads is that people feel betrayed and I believe that feeling is genuine. So here's the actual CMV. Why can't everyone just let White Guys have this one. Why can't we all just either accept that this is and will be a site that leans towards issues important to (straight) White Men and will be biased towards their opinions or leave and go to a different site. Its not like their aren't other hubs. And I'm not saying that there shouldn't be differences of opinion etc. (newsflash: not all White guys think the same). But just as anyone is welcome to watch Logo and comment on it etc no one would complain that the content is too gay or be upset if anti-gay things or things that appear to be anti-gay get the equivalent of downvoted (and no I'm not comparing experiences in any way). I also think that if people recognized this gping in there would be less abrasive push back from the trolls and \"dark side\" of reddit.

When it function in that way everything seemed to go more or less fine ( of course there were others interspersed but that was the majority of viewpoints ). As more and more groups began to be introduced there were shall we say competing pursuit. They correctly live asking for space within the community as well. However , the trouble is White men had already kind of adopted this space as a place where they could discuss their problems without feeling guilty etc. For deterrent example , when people complain about false rape charges getting to the front page constantly or reverse discrimination cases etc etc. I imagine the SJW this and that we often see is just pushback from White Men feeling `` invaded '' for lack of a better word. I 'm not saying this cost right. I think this last ush of banning poor boy etc also has the same implications first FatPeopleHate is seen as appealing to women and feminists. Then Coontown seen as appealing to minorities. I think its reflective of White Men feeling like all other people scram to have their spaces etc. but they neer do. What I got from the train of thought is that people feel betrayed and I believe that feeling is genuine. So hither 's the actual CMV. Why ca n't everyone just have White Guys have this one. Why ca n't we all just either accept that this embody and will be a site that leans towards issues important to ( straight ) White Men and will be biased towards their opinions or leave and go to a different site. Its not like their are n't former hubs. And I 'm not saying that there should n't live differences of opinion etc. ( newsflash : not all White guy think the same ). But just as anyone is welcome to watch Logo and comment on it etc no one would complain that the content is too gay or be upset if anti-gay things or things that appear to be anti-gay stick the equivalent of downvoted ( and no I 'm not comparing experiences in any way ). I also think that if people recognized this gping in there would be less scratchy push back from the trolls and `` dark side '' of reddit.

{"original_text": "I'd like to preface this by saying that parts of my post may sound like they're bragging, but they're not trying to come across that way. Also, I'm using a throwaway because I would not like my age to be associated with my main account. This is going to come across rant-like but I am very open to having my view changed. sorry for the wall of text Hey, I'd just like to get this out of the way first, I'm technically \"gifted\" and I'm 13 years old (turning 14 in February). No, I'm not the type of kid to be \"I'm 12 years old but I'm really mature!!11,\" I can be immature and most of time - at least at school - I do act immature. Also, when I say \"technically gifted\" I mean that I'm assigned a letter, which is P. Category P, at least in British Columbia where I live, stands for gifted. Also, I will be focusing on Canada throughout this post as it's where I live, specifically British Columbia but I'm sure the US and most other Canadian provinces are quite a bit like this. I was designated as gifted about 2 months ago although I had originally been tested in Grade 2 (Grade 7, going to 8 now) but they didn't give me the designation although they gave me high scores. I was tested again in Grade 6 and I still didn't receive the designation, not sure why they tested me that time, I was never told. The reason I just received the designation is because my district just gave out the funding to test for gifted children. Yes, my school district just gave the funding to TEST for gifted children. Not to do anything with them. I was given to option to skip a grade when I went to get my results, which would mean going in to high school. After that meeting I was never contacted by the school psychologist (The person who did my test and gave me the results) again. Now, skipping a grade might sound fine and dandy but the negatives out weigh the positives. The biggest being the big impact on my social life. I'm not a very outgoing person and I might as well be the definition of awkward. So going to high school surrounded by a bunch of people a year older than me isn't going to be very pleasant. Now, say I wanted to get into a gifted program well, my district, and for a matter of fact, almost all districts in British Columbia don't have a program for gifted children. There's a special schoolprogram in Victoria and one in Vancouver. If you don't live in either of those cities, your screwed. Anyways, I'm getting off topic here, here is where I get a little angry. Last year in Grade 6 we had quite a few special needs children (Severely autistic, Down Syndrome, and some other stuff). These guys go to school and play all day. Of course, they can't participate in actual classes, but instead of actually doing stuff with these kids, they walk around the halls with them while they scream and interrupt classes. Every few kids get a helper, I'm not sure of the exact number but I think it's around 3 kids to a helper. But usually there are about 10 kids that are severely special needs so there are 3 or 4 helpers. These helpers stay with the kids at all times. This doesn't sound too bad, right? School pays for a couple extra teachers that help a few special needs kids. But then you hear about how they're treated. These kids regularly went on field trips, extravagant ones at that, sailing, those fancy indoors gymnasiums, to the airport to have a flight around the city (This one was weird, but they did it). Mean while, we had 25 - 30 kids to one teacher and I was bored out of my mind because I knew all the curriculum and the teachers were already stretched too thin to give any of the gifted kids special attention, hell, the teacher would sometimes ask me to go around and help the other kids because too many kids were confused with a new math concept or needed help writing their essays. So while these special needs kids got to go on special field trips and had many teachers to so few children, our teachers were struggling to help any kids who might fall behind and I was getting so bored I ended up skipping school to stay home and program or learn a language (Working on Latin right now). This year, the same thing happened, except it was worse. Instead of me just skipping school, I just stopped trying and my grades plummeted. School was so boring to me it's getting unbearable. The final nail in the coffin for me was my English teacher putting me in a low level reading group. I read at the 99th percentile. I just didn't even try anymore. I didn't even read the curriculum. The only reason I passed was because I did the bear minimum on worksheets and tests. Of course, I got excited when they tested me, only to find out that it wasn't going to change anything about 2 weeks later. I know another gifted kid a couple grades ahead of me (Going on grade 11 next year) who almost dropped out. This kid is a genius, I think he has an [FSIQ] of about 150. The only reason he stayed was because his parents pretty much forced him to. He used to just skip school. I don't talk to him much anymore so I don't know whats happening with him now, but he's a prime example of what happens when you don't treat gifted kids like gifted kids. Mean while, the special needs kids in his school get their own room, their own teachers, their own everything. Even with a smaller classroom the teachers don't give a flying fuck about you. And it's not just the special needs kids, it's the less intelligent kids that get special treatment. I don't want to call them stupid but that's what some of them are. They aren't special needs, they're just dumb (really don't want to sound rude but that's the best way to describe them). They get student teachers to help them, they get easier worksheets and for some reason, I'm still sitting there, doing worksheets that are far below my grade level. I haven't heard many arguments as to why I'm wrong since I'm not a fan of sharing this view since it kinda sounds like I'm hating on special needs people if I do. The one that I have been told is this: \"Gifted children are smart enough to be left on their own. So what if they get bored, so does every other kid! Special needs children simply can't do the work, they need to have their own helpers!\" Okay, that's fine, I recognize that special needs children can't do the work, and I'm absolutely fine with them getting their own teachers. What I'm not fine with is gifted children not getting any special attention. Every kid gets bored, but non gifted kids still learn stuff in school. I don't. That's how bad it gets. I don't learn stuff. I don't interact with kids I get so bored. I wouldn't say I get depressed but I do start feeling sad. It's a vicious cycle when I'm told I'm intelligent, then I get these terrible marks. Then I start hanging out with the wrong groups and my marks plummet more, on the days that I go to school I sit at the back of the classroom with the \"bad kids\" and listen to music, I don't pay attention to the teacher because I don't care what she's telling me, because I know it. This is were I sound very contradictory. I say that I know the curriculum but then I get bad marks. It's kind of a hard thing to explain, I guess I can try to explain it and it might sound like absolute bullshit but here it is: I stop trying because I get bored and when I get bored I rush through things or don't read things fully or think clearly. Instead of think through a test question and writing a well thought out answer, I write some absolute bullshit. Because it's fun. That's how bored I am. I purposely fail tests because it's more fun than learning the curriculum. I enjoy doing something like: What earths core composed of? Fairy dust and love Yes, I gave that as an answer to a question on a science test. I actually wrote \"Fairy dust and love\" on a test because it gives me some sort of amusement, more than writing \"nickel and iron\" does. Anyways, back to the topic at hand. I know that special needs kids need their own special teachers. Just give the bloody gifted kids some too. But we don't have the funding!!! Yep, that's also something I've heard. You wanna know what my schools most recent purchase was? You're not going to believe this one... A mother fucking[ 1300 dollar drone] . Not rented. They literally bought a 1300 dollar drone. What for? Maybe it's a good purpose! Nope. They took a picture of the school with it. Instead of hiring a photographer to climb up on a ladder and take a picture of our entire school like every other school ever, they spent 1300 dollars on a drone to take 1 picture. To clarify I mean one of those pictures where your school huddles together outside and then gets a picture taken, I don't mean the school building. This is kind of a bad example because a CEA (The kind of teacher who teaches special needs kids) salary is like 30 grand. But if we can pitch the idea of buying a drone to our funding guy, couldn't we pitch the idea of getting an extra teacher for the gifted kids? So yeah, they probably can get the funding. It's that we're not the priority. The special needs kids are. The dumb kids are. The kids who excel? Fuck'em, they can have fun in University. I guess I've conveyed my opinion as I see it. Sorry if the post isn't incredibly clear, I get a little emotional about some of this stuff. Feel free to ask me any questions. I'm very open to any criticism. Hello, users of CMV!

Happy CMVing!", "text_perturb": "I 'd like to preface this by enunciate that parts of my post may sound like they 're bragging , but they 're not trying to come across that way. Also , I 'm using a throwaway because I would not like my eld to be associated with my main account. This is going to come across rant-like but I am very open to having my view commute. sorry for the wall of text Hey , I 'd just like to get this out of the way for the first time , I 'm technically `` gifted '' and I 'm 13 years old ( turning 14 in February ). No , I 'm not the type of kid to be `` I 'm 12 twelvemonth old but I 'm really mature ! ! 11 , '' I can be immature and most of time - at least at school - I do act immature. Also , when I say `` technically gifted '' I mean that I 'm assigned a alphabetic character , which is P. Category P , at least in british Columbia where I live , stands for gifted. Also , I bequeath be focusing on Canada throughout this post as it 's where I live , specifically British Columbia but I 'm sure the US and most other Canadian provinces are quite a bit like this. I was designated as gifted about 2 months ago although I had originally been tested in Grade 2 ( Grade 7 , going to 8 now ) but they did n't give me the designation although they gave me eminent scores. I was tested again in Grade 6 and I still did n't receive the designation , not certain why they tested me that time , I was never told. The reason I just received the designation comprise because my district just gave out the funding to test for gifted children. Yes , my school territorial dominion just gave the funding to TEST for gifted children. Not to do anything with them. I was given to option to skip a grade when I went to get my issue , which would mean going in to high school. After that meeting I cost never contacted by the school psychologist ( The person who did my test and gave me the results ) again. Now , skipping a grade might sound fine and dandy but the negative out weigh the positives. The biggest being the big impact on my social life sentence. I 'm non a very outgoing person and I might as well be the definition of awkward. So operate to high school surrounded by a bunch of people a year older than me is n't operate to be very pleasant. Now , say I wanted to get into a gifted program intimately , my district , and for a matter of fact , almost all districts in British Columbia do n't have a program for gifted children. There 's a special schoolprogram in Victoria and one in vancouver. If you do n't live in either of those cities , your get it on. Anyways , I 'm getting off topic here , here is where I get a niggling angry. Last year in Grade 6 we hold quite a few special needs children ( Severely autistic , Down Syndrome , and some other stuff ). These guys go to school and play all solar day. Of course , they ca n't participate in actual division , but instead of actually doing stuff with these kids , they walk around the halls with them while they scream and interrupt division. Every few kids receive a helper , I 'm not sure of the exact number but I think it 's around 3 kids to a helper. But usually there are about 10 minor that are severely special needs so there are 3 or 4 helpers. These helpers stay with the fry at all times. This does n't sound too bad , right ? School pays for a couple extra instructor that help a few special needs kids. But then you hear about how they 're treated. These kids on a regular basis went on field trips , extravagant ones at that , sailing , those fancy indoors gymnasiums , to the airport to have a flight around the city ( This one was weird , but they did it ).

{"original_text": "I have hypothyroidism, PCOS, and used to be a emotional binge eater. I lost over 60lbs. I understand that conditions can limit someones ability to easily lose weight, but considering I have 2 physical ones and 1 mental one, and still lost weight. I just don't understand. I'm starting to look at fat loss as simply a matter of accepting that your diet is flawed and making changes. People have false views of how healthy they eat and this pride prevents them from making changes they need. Everytime I post something like this I just get a million downvotes. Why do people downvote me? Is it because I'm wrong somehow and millions of people truly can't lose weight. Edit: Okay it makes more sense. \"Simply\" being a troubled word that implies weight loss is easy. That was incorrect. I was obese as a child and lost the weight when I grew old enough to buy and prepare my own food. I'm blessed with a preference for the healthy food and slowly taught myself to lower my appetite, making my experience easier than most. I shouldn't project myself so much on other people. No one is arguing thermodynamics or saying weight loss is impossible. Everyone is saying that it is hard and after varies arguments I'm inclined to agree. However, while weight loss is hard due to various factors, they do have solutions. ex: An emotional eater can indivually work out their food addiction. While it isn't easy, it can be done. I can't settle for \"can't.\" I feel like that is too dismissive and hopeless. But it is a matter of willpower. The debate is whether people can control their willpower. It is also a matter of wanting to lose weight. Settling for being overweight is a choice a lot of people seem to make. But I guess its sort of the same thing as smoking. Something in theory can be fixed by putting down the cigarette but a ton of inner strife. But in all seriousness, for all people who do want to loose weight. How can I help them (I forgot to mention I'm a nutrition student) loose weight by dealing with psychological factors. Nutrition actually has little classes on psychology and weight loss, and mostly cooking and science classes. I sorta rely on reddit to educate myself. How can weight loss become easier? What can I do? What can society do? Etc Also, I'm kinda hung up on few things. I feel like while people may not want to, pretty much every condition can be overcome. With the exception of people with extremely low BMRs where the subsequent nutrient defences and hunger pangs outweigh the benefits of wright loss. So I guess my view has been partially changed. So like \"half deltas all around.\" When I figure out how to give a delta I will award particularly thought provoking comments.

Everyone is saying that it is hard and after varies argumentation I 'm inclined to agree. still , while weight loss is hard due to various factors , they do have solutions. ex : An emotional eater send away indivually work out their food addiction. While it is n't easy , it can cost done. I ca n't settle for `` ca n't. `` I feel like that comprise too dismissive and hopeless. But it is a matter of self possession. The debate is whether people displace control their willpower. It comprise also a matter of wanting to lose weight. Settling for being overweight is a choice a lot of people seem to pee pee. But I guess its sort of the same affair as smoking. Something in theory can be fixed by putting down the cigarette but a gross ton of inner strife. But in all earnestness , for all people who do want to loose weight. How can I help them ( I forgot to mention I 'm a nutrition student ) loose weight by deal out with psychological factors. Nutrition actually has little grade on psychology and weight loss , and mostly cooking and science grade. I sorta rely on reddit to educate myself. How can weight passing become easier ? What can I do ? What can society do ? Etc Also , I 'm kinda hung up on few things. I feel like while people may not want to , middling much every condition can be overcome. With the exception of people with highly low BMRs where the subsequent nutrient defences and hunger pangs outweigh the benefits of wright loss. So I guess my view has been partly changed. So like `` half delta all around. `` When I figure out how to give a delta I leave award particularly thought provoking comments. Edit 2 : oh I forgot to mention I never ever condone bullying or shaming fat the great unwashed. The never directly tell people they should fall back weight. From when I was fat `` my mirror tells me I 'm fat everyday , I do n't need to hear it from anyone else '' howdy , users of CMV ! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"original_text": "My view is a little bit more specific than the one expressed in the title, but I wanted to keep the title short so I am expanding here: I think that governments of countries that work a lot (eg. more than 35 hours a week for the average worker) AND have high unemployment should be encouraging shorter work weeks and more vacation time, so that companies will hire more people to fill in the gaps. I believe that that this will result in a happier population because they will have more free time, and will also result in lower unemployment. (excepting cultures where working more makes people happier, which I think are rare in Western society) I think that the way government should do this is via aggressively progressive tax rates, since people aren't likely to work more hours if more hours doesn't translate to proportionally higher take-home pay, they should also enact stricter laws around workweek and workday length, with companies that lie to employees or prospective employees about workdayworkweek length being fined heavily and forced to reimburse workers. Some fields, especially unskilled fields, should be subject to maximum workweek length laws, preventing companies from scheduling employees for more than 40 hours a week. I acknowledge that there are some companies and industries that could be hurt by these laws, and exceptions can be made for them. For example, some industries aren't amenable to 40-hour work weeks, notably ones require to worker to be a remote location. Some businesses can't easily reduce hours and employ more people, because they only have one employee filling a certain role, and there is not enough work for two people without cutting hours so much that nobody wants the job. So there can be exceptions for these types of businesses, although they would still be fined for lying about or misrepresenting the required hours. There could also be exceptions to the laws preventing long work weeks, for example in fields with a much higher demand for labor than supply, and in instances where an employee needs to be called in due to another employee being sick, or similar situations. I believe that the free market can't be relied upon to solve this problem in the general case, because there is a fixed overhead for each employee hired, so employers have an incentive to reduce the number of employees and increase the hours per employee, but I think this is bad for society and should be stopped, and the government is the only entity that should do so. Note that there are specific instances where the free market can be replied upon, and that is in fields where demand for employees far exceeds supply of employees, and in countries with near-full employment. In those instances the government need not get involved. However, there are also exceptions to the exceptions, for example in some fields, there is no inherent aspect of the field that requires long hours, yet long hours are the norm in that field anyway, even though demand for labor exceeds supply. In those cases some middle ground should be found in the laws, but I'm not exactly sure where that would be. Also, even in fields where demand exceeds supply, reducing the amount of hours an employee can work incentivizes the employers to train new employees, which is good for society, so those fields should only be exempt from some of the laws I am proposing.

Happy CMVing!", "text_perturb": "My view is a little bit more specific than the one expressed in the title , but I wanted to keep the title short so I am expanding here : I think that governments of countries that work a flock ( eg. more than 35 hours a week for the average worker ) AND have high unemployment should be encouraging shorter employment weeks and more vacation time , so that companies will hire more people to fill in the gaps. I believe that that this will result in a happier population because they will have to a greater extent free time , and will also result in lower unemployment. ( excepting cultures where working more makes people happier , which I think are rare in Western society ) I think that the direction government should do this is via aggressively progressive tax rates , since people are n't likely to work more hours if more hours does n't translate to proportionally higher take-home pay , they should also enact stricter laws around workweek and workday length , with companies that lie to employees or prospective employees about workdayworkweek length being fined heavily and forced to reimburse workers. Some fields , especially unskilled fields , should be subject to maximum workweek length laws , preventing caller from scheduling employees for more than 40 hours a week. I acknowledge that there are some companies and industries that could represent hurt by these laws , and exceptions can represent made for them. For example , some industries are n't amenable to 40-hour work weeks , notably ones demand to worker to be a remote location. Some businesses ca n't easily reduce hours and employ more people , because they only have one employee filling a certain role , and there is not enough employment for two people without cutting hours so much that nobody wants the job. So there can be exceptions for these types of line , although they would still be fined for lying about or misrepresenting the required hours. There could also be exceptions to the laws preventing long work weeks , for example in fields with a lots higher demand for labor than supply , and in instances where an employee needs to be called in due to another employee being sick , or similar situations. I believe that the free market ca n't be relied upon to solve this problem in the general case , because there is a fixed overhead for each employee hired , so employers have an incentive to reduce the phone number of employees and increase the hours per employee , but I think this is bad for society and should be stopped , and the government is the only entity that should do so. Note that there are specific instances where the free market can be replied upon , and that is in fields where demand for employee far exceeds supply of employee , and in countries with near-full employment. In those instances the government need not get convoluted. nonetheless , there are also exceptions to the exceptions , for example in some fields , there is no inherent aspect of the field that requires long hours , yet long hours are the norm in that field anyway , even though demand for labor exceeds supply. In those cases some middle ground should represent found in the laws , but I 'm not exactly sure where that would represent. Also , even in fields where demand exceeds supply , reducing the amount of hours an employee can work incentivizes the employer to train new employees , which is good for society , so those fields should only be exempt from some of the laws I am proposing. how do you do , users of CMV !

It is a guarantor of all other forms of rights, or it at least allows for the possibility of other rights.

Rap to me is like in the same category as a terrible singer sometimes. Every person on this earth that can speak is capable of rapping. You can't say the same for singers, that can sing on key. You might say, it takes skill to rap well. No it doesn't. It takes time, and a pen and paper. It can be mastered relatively easy. Please show me why they deserve to be respected as musicians. Edit 1: Okay uscottevil110 pointed out to me, performing, or the entertainment value is a big part of a rappers act. It takes tremendous confidence and talent to get on stage and move a crowd with your lyrics. Some rappers are capable of this so, I changed my view that some have talent in that regard, but as far as the actual rapping I still believe that I could truthfully be the next Meek, or Young Thug. Edit 2: Let me clarify what talent is to me. I already know what the webster definition is, the natural ability or aptitude to do something. Let's take young thug as an example and Lamarr.

So everyone is talented then in some way. Lamar it would take longer, and he has a nice flow, but still it could be easily copied. Now, REAL talent to me, is a perormance like Keyshia Cole singing [Love] one of the greatest songs of all time. Or Peter Green ripping the shit out of a guitar, in songs like, need your love so bad, or [the supernatural] . That's REAL talent, compared to something like [this] . REAL talent is something that not your average jor could do. Some are born with it. For some it takes years to become good at it, but it has to have a level of difficulty, in my view, that the average person can't easily attain. Edit 3: uglory2hypnotoad showed me writing a full length album on Eminems level does take I guess some real skill. So there are a few rappers who have some real talent. But generally they are untalented. However every singer that can sing on key is talented to me. It's just in a whole'nother caliber of music to me, for the simple reason it's next to impossible to attain. Comparing Eminem to any singer that can sing on key, is like comparing Iman Shumpert to Lebron James. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to tease out meaning. Many other amendments overlap in meaning and could be combined to simplify them while also covering more people. The fact is, it is outdated. I believe it should be revised every 100 years or so because culture and language are organic. They change based on technology, public conscious, and international relations. Should we follow the advice of a group who believed slavery was acceptable? That thought only white, male, property owners shouldcould vote? Can you read through the document and understand what was meant or does much of it come across as confusing to todays readers? The world has changed and I believe we need to change with it in order to be relevant. I also believe our ideas and views from today will experience the same degradation over time. In 100 years will the world still care about gun rights? Will the population still speak mostly english or will we add more spanish to our vocabulary? Will words like gay hold the same meaning as it does now or will it return to the usage it once had? We cannot know. We should not force our ideas through time, expecially when future generations will have the same issues understanding us as we do understanding the founding fathers. What I can't understand is why we are clinging to the past, to a group who would likely be viewed as backward racists today. We should take what we believe now and govern by those beliefs. We should update, revise, and examine our core ideas from time to time to at least make sure we still understand what they are. I am not talking about simply throwing the constitution out either. I am saying we should interpret it for today, update it, and use our revised version instead. Then both can be looked at by the next generation and adjusted as needed. It should update and change with the citizenry and the times while still being the timeless core of our laws. It would take a lot of work, a lot would change, but I believe we would be better for it.

{"original_text": "Alright, so, I was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while I am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, I will only do so if you can actually change my mind. I will not give up easily. I believe I can change this country, better yet, this world for the better. The whole idea behind what I am about to say relates back to evolution. Humans do not allow evolution to take place properly. We save the weak. I personally believe that we should execute the weak. yes, this sounds harsh but let me explain why. We are not advancing as a race. For now though, we will keep it to America for the sake of the argument and hope the rest of the world catches on. Another massive problem we are facing is over population, we are using our resources and producing waste and pollution and mind blowing rates. You look at animals and if an animal doesn't want to eat, it dies, if a human doesn't want to eat, it has an eating disorder and is treated for the disorder. More importantly that human is allowed to procreate. We allow shitty genetics to be passed on. We SAVE the WEAK. We also allow these morbidly obese, incredibly stupid people live and breed. If an animal in the wild isn't fit, or cannot attract a mate, it will die and or be unable to pass on its genetics. Humans may be fat and physically repulsive but if they have money they can still get women and still have children, which fucks with the gene pool. I could go on for longer in this section but if more reasoning is necessary I'll continue on later. Now to determine who is to be executed. The type of people I want to execute are people who are not able to make a contribution to society. If you weigh 500 pounds but you're incredibly smart, you can still make a contribution to society. The opposite is also true, if you're borderline retarded but you're very physically fit, you can also contribute to society. People who are mentally unstable shall also be executed as we wouldn't want their genetics passed on and they are a threat to the gene pool we are creating. What will determine who is executed: At the age of 14 years old, annual testing will begin based on birthday. There will be three tests, a mental test, a physical test, and a psychological test. Your Mental test exactly 3 months after your birthday and your physical test 9 months after your birthday. Tests will vary depending on your age, the older you get the harder they become, until the age of 20 where they will remain the same until 35 and gradually work their way down until the age of 65 where no further testing will be required. At the age of 20 we will also introduce psychological testing which will continue until the age of 65. What the tests will consist of: The mental test will be a basic evaluation of your ability to do math, your ability to read and write, and your basic understanding of the sciences. This test should not be difficult, anyone who has at least a D average in school should be just fine. For the physical test, every age group will be required to complete a mile in 16 minutes. This is a very easy time to make, you can walk that pace. Physical tests will include varying push up or sit up tests depending on age group. There may be a few other exercises required in certain age groups, and the amount of repetitions will also vary depending on age. this should be easy for anyone who isn't morbidly obese. Next is the psychological test. These will be administered every 5 years to insure mental stability and health of everyone. We want the mental health of our gene pool to be good as well. Lastly, there will be certain ways to be omitted to testing, ALL WILL BE FROM SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY, the main one being in the military. If you served in the military without being dishonorably discharged, you will be exempt from any further testing in your lifetime. Another example of a way to be omitted from testing is by paying for it. The cost will be 25,000 per year, per person. Many will be angry that it's giving more power to the rich, but I see it as a valid way of determining someones potential for making a contribution to society. If you are rich, I will almost guarantee you are either physically fit enough or mentally fit enough to pass the tests and you would have been fine anyway. AN IMPORTANT NOTE: You will only have to pass 2 out of 3 tests. How we will execute people: We will set up an organization in charge of carrying out testing and executing people. My idea is to possibly have the military be in charge of this, though I haven't had the time to think too much into that, this I am very open to other ideas on. The method of execution I think will be best is the firing squad. 8 men, 2 with real bullets to ensure death, 6 with blanks for the obvious reason. For those who are unaware, my understanding is that firing squads use primarily blanks so the gunmen aren't aware of who actually killed the person so they don't have trouble with living life after killing someone. Now another thing I would like to do that isn't executing people, but will improve our gene pool is preventing certain people from having children. People with MORE THAN two generations of diagnosed cancer or potentially terminal illnesses that tend to be passed on genetically will be sterilized. These people will not be allowed to produce offspring, however we will make it easy for them to adopt if they would like to have children. I would also like to place a limit on the amount of children a person may have. The maximum number of children a person may have is 3, which is a very reasonable amount. It should slow the rate of population increase or possibly make the population decrease due to some couples not having children or only having 1 child. There is no reason to have more than 3 children because at that point you're just putting a burden on society. If say you already have 2 children and you would like to have a third but you end up with twins, triplets, or even more, you will be allowed to keep them as it wasn't your intent to have that many. When you hit the limit for children you will be sterilized. This is all I can think of for now, if I remember more of my plan I will post. So reddit users, change my view.", "text_perturb": "Alright , so , I was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion , and while I am loose to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely , I will only do so if you can actually change my mind.

Tests will change depending on your age , the older you get the harder they become , until the age of 20 where they will remain the same until 35 and gradually work their way down until the age of 65 where no further testing will be required. At the years of 20 we will also introduce psychological testing which will continue until the years of 65. What the tests will consist of : The mental test will be a basic evaluation of your ability to practise math , your ability to read and write , and your basic understanding of the sciences. This test should not be difficult , anyone who has at least a D average in shoal should be just fine. For the physical test , every age group will be required to complete a sea mile in 16 minutes. This is a very easy time to score , you can walk that pace. Physical trial run will include varying push up or sit up trial run depending on age group. There may be a few other exercises required in certain age mathematical group , and the amount of repetitions will also vary depending on age. this should be easy for anyone who embody n't morbidly obese. Next exist the psychological test. These will be administered every 5 years to insure mental constancy and health of everyone. We want the mental health of our factor pool to be good as well. Lastly , there will be certain ways to be omitted to testing , ALL WILL BE FROM SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT part TO SOCIETY , the main one being in the military. If you served in the military without being dishonorably discharged , you leave be exempt from any further testing in your lifetime. Another instance of a way to be omitted from testing is by paying for it. The cost will be 25,000 per yr , per person. Many will embody angry that it 's giving more power to the rich , but I see it as a valid way of determining someones potential for making a contribution to society. If you are rich , I will almost secure you are either physically fit enough or mentally fit enough to pass the tests and you would have been fine anyway. AN IMPORTANT NOTE : You leave only have to pass 2 out of 3 tests. How we will execute people : We will set up an governance in charge of carrying out testing and executing people. My idea is to peradventure have the military be in charge of this , though I have n't had the time to think too much into that , this I am very open to other ideas on. The method of execution I think will be best is the firing police squad. 8 men , 2 with tangible bullets to ensure death , 6 with blanks for the obvious reason. For those who are unaware , my understanding is that firing squads use primarily blanks so the gunmen are n't aware of who actually killed the person so they do n't feature trouble with living life after killing someone. Now another thing I would like to do that is n't executing people , but leave improve our gene pool is preventing certain people from having children. People with more than THAN two generations of diagnosed cancer or potentially terminal illnesses that tend to be passed on genetically will be sterilized. These people will not be allowed to produce offspring , however we will make it easy for them to dramatize if they would like to have children. I would also like to place a demarcation line on the amount of children a person may have. The maximum number of children a person may have is 3 , which is a very reasonable quantity. It should slow the rate of population increase or possibly make the population decrease due to some couples not ingest children or only ingest 1 child. There is no reason to have more than 3 youngster because at that point you 're just putting a burden on society. If say you already have 2 children and you would like to have a third but you end up with twins , triplets , or yet more , you will be allowed to keep them as it was n't your intent to have that many. When you hit the limit for children you will follow sterilized. This is all I can think of for now , if I remember more than of my plan I will post. thence reddit users , change my view.

First, it's a war for oil because all of a sudden, without any input from the people, the US military is not just bombing ISIS in Iraq, but bombing ISIS in Syria as well. Where did they get that authority? Syria is a sovereign nation. They are certainly not \"allowing terrorism to flourish\" as US officials like Samantha Powers, John Kerry, and Barack Obama have claimed. Assad has been fighting terrorism since day one.

Furthermore, the FSA is a mix of Alawite, Shia, and Sunni Muslims, whereas ISIS is purely a group of extremist WahhabistsSalafists Sunni Muslims. Why on earth would Assad, an Alawite (Shiite) dedicate more resources to fighting the FSA than ISIS? It doesn't make sense. Alawites and Shiites are the ones who put Assad in power.

He will say that Assad is allowing ISIS to thrive, and that the only way to defeat them is to remove Assad from power. After removing Assad, ISIS will likely move on the oil fields, in an attempt to secure resources and capital, and Obama will argue that the only way to cripple them is to take over their revenue source: the oil fields.

{"original_text": "As a lifelong classical musician, I am absolutely in love with the repertoire of symphony orchestras, opera, and chamber music. I am always trying to think of ways to introduce the music to a wider audience and get more people to love listening to classical music. So here it is: I believe that the main reason people don't like listening to classical music as much as other genres is because classical music rarely includes a drum set. Definitions I use in this CMV: Classical music: not only music from the classical period. I'm using the blanket term to describe any music typically performed by orchestras, or chamber ensembles. What a non-musician would think of as \"classical.\" Everything from Bach to Mahler to Bartok to Ives. Popular music: not just the narrow genre of \"pop,\" but the broad term to include anything listened to by a more mainstream audience. Could include anything from oldies, to country, to EDM, to metal, and beyond. Now to explain my view: I really don't think there's that much difference between classical music and other genres. -Both genres use the same 12 notes. (The exception obviously being microtonal classical music, which even as a career classical musician, sometimes I have a really hard time appreciating. But 99.9 of classical music uses the same 12 notes as popular music.) -Both use the same basic palette of harmonies and tonalities (majorminor chords, added 7ths, 9ths, etc.). -Both have the same basic choices of meters. (44 time, mixed meter, etc.) -Both use many of the same instruments. (Guitars aren't exclusive to popular music, and violins and'celli aren't exclusive to orchestras.) -Both contain pieces with textlyrics, and both genres also contain pieces that are purely instrumental. (A lot of people point to lyrics as the main reason they love certain genres of popular music, but both genres have music with textlyrics.) -In the pieces with textlyrics, both genres use many languages besides English. (Lots of people say they can't understand classical music sung in German, yet they listen to plenty of K-pop or songs in French and don't mind looking up a translation, or they appreciate it for other aspects besides the lyrics.) -Both genres contain relatively short pieces (3-5 minutes) and longer pieces (10, or even 60 minutes). (So the length of composition isn't really a big factor, since you can find both short and long pieces in either genre.) So those are many of the similarities I can think of. But one thing that's really different between most (not all) classical music and most (not all) of popular music is the fact that the drumset (or electronic beat, or incredibly rhythmic or percussive strumming on a guitar, or vocal percussion, or something that makes a similar sound) keeps really obvious control of the rhythm at all times. It's really hard not to know where the beat is in popular music, whereas in classical music, sometimes the meter is a bit more obscure. I think that most people really like feeling their body or mind move in time with the music, and so the accessibility of the rhythmic feel in popular genres is appealing to a wider audience. Contrast this to classical music, where sometimes, even to a trained musician, the meter is intentionally less clear. In most cases, the meter may be clear to someone who knows what they're listening for, but still not totally obvious to the average music listener. It gives people less of a rhythmic foothold into the piece, which I contend is the reason that people don't enjoy classical music as much. To clarify: I'm not coming from a place of thinking classical music is better. I'm not assigning value judgments here, or trying to be an elitist. I'm merely trying to find what I would consider the main differences between classical and popular genres to be. And to me, the lack of a drumset (or other instrument that keeps the meter as a very up-front feature) in classical music seems to be the biggest difference that I can spot. One final caveat: In this CMV, I'm mostly talking about listening to music on one's own, like at your house, or on your own iPod. I think the experience of attending a concert of classical music vs. pop music is a really different one. I don't blame anyone that thinks that orchestra concerts can feel a bit stuffy. So while people may enjoy the more energetic atmosphere at a popular music concert, I don't think there's much difference to putting on your iPod while you go for a run and listening to Beethoven vs. the Beatles when you're on your own and not in a concert setting. The reason I'd like my view changed: I truly want to know the reasons that most people would have for not loving classical music so that I can address that in my future performance and teaching in the hopes of exposing a wider swath of the population to an art form that I love so much. I truly believe that classical music is universal and anyone can enjoy it. But I need to start by finding out the real reasons that people don't already listen to it. The main thing that I think will CMV: -Compelling examples of features people like about popular music that are unique to popular music. Not features that are shared between both genres. I really want to find out what makes popular styles uniquely engaging to people in ways that classical music is not. TL;DR: Classical music almost never has a drumset to help keep really clear track of the time for the listener.

Happy CMVing!", "text_perturb": "As a lifelong classical musician , I am absolutely in love with the repertoire of symphony orchestra , opera , and chamber music. I am always trying to think of way of life to introduce the music to a wider audience and get more people to love listening to classical music. So here it is : I believe that the main reason people do n't like listening to graeco roman music as much as other genres is because graeco roman music rarely includes a drum set. Definitions I use in this CMV : Classical music : not only music from the classical catamenia. I 'm using the blanket term to describe any music typically performed by orchestras , or chamber ensemble. What a non-musician would think of as `` classical. `` Everything from Bach to Mahler to Bartok to Ives. Popular music : not just the narrow genre of `` soda water , '' but the broad term to include anything listened to by a more mainstream audience. Could include anything from oldies , to state , to EDM , to metal , and beyond. Now to explain my view : I genuinely do n't think there 's that much difference between classical music and other genres. -Both music genre use the same 12 notes. ( The exception obviously being microtonal classical music , which even as a career classical musician , sometimes I sustain a really hard time appreciating. But 99. 9 of classical medicine uses the same 12 notes as popular medicine. ) -Both use the same basic palette of harmonies and tonalities ( majorminor chords , add up 7ths , 9ths , etc. ). -Both have the same basic pick of meters. ( 44 meter , mixed meter , etc. ) -Both practice many of the same instruments. ( Guitars are n't exclusive to democratic music , and violins and'celli are n't exclusive to orchestras. ) -Both contain pieces with textlyrics , and both genres also contain pieces that are strictly instrumental. ( A lot of people head to lyrics as the main reason they love certain genres of popular music , but both genres have music with textlyrics. ) -In the pieces with textlyrics , both literary genre use many languages besides English. ( Lots of people aver they ca n't understand classical music sung in German , yet they listen to plenty of K-pop or songs in French and do n't mind looking up a translation , or they appreciate it for other aspects besides the lyrics. ) -Both genres contain relatively short pieces ( 3-5 minutes ) and longsighted pieces ( 10 , or even 60 minutes ). ( So the length of composition is n't really a bighearted factor , since you can find both short and long pieces in either genre. ) So those are many of the similarity I can think of. But one thing that 's really different between most ( not all ) classical music and most ( not all ) of popular music is the fact that the drumset ( or electronic beat , or incredibly rhythmic or percussive strumming on a guitar , or vocal percussion , or something that makes a similar sound ) keeps really obvious ascendance of the rhythm at all times. It 's really hard not to know where the beat equal in popular music , whereas in classical music , sometimes the meter equal a bit more obscure. I think that most people really like feeling their body or mind move in time with the music , and so the accessibility of the rhythmic look in popular genres is appealing to a wider audience. Contrast this to greco roman music , where sometimes , even to a trained musician , the meter is intentionally less clear. In most cases , the meter may personify clear to someone who knows what they 're listening for , but still not totally obvious to the average music listener. It gives people less of a rhythmic foothold into the piece , which I contend is the intellect that people do n't enjoy classical music as much. To clarify : I 'm non coming from a place of thinking classical music is better. I 'm not arrogate value judgments here , or trying to be an elitist. I 'm merely trying to find what I would consider the main differences between classical and popular genres to embody. And to me , the lack of a drumset ( or other instrument that keeps the meter as a very up-front feature ) in greco roman music seems to be the biggest difference that I can spot. One final caveat : In this CMV , I 'm mostly talking about listening to euphony on one 's own , like at your house , or on your own iPod. I think the experience of serve a concert of classical music vs. pop music is a really dissimilar one. I do n't blame anyone that thinks that orchestra concerts can finger a bit stuffy. So while people may enjoy the more energetic atmosphere at a popular music concert , I do n't think there 's much difference to arrange on your iPod while you go for a run and listening to Beethoven vs. the beatles when you 're on your own and not in a concert setting. The reason I 'd like my view changed : I truly want to know the reasons that most people would have for not loving classical euphony so that I can address that in my future performance and teaching in the hopes of exposing a wider swath of the population to an art form that I love so much. I truly believe that classical euphony is universal and anyone can enjoy it. But I need to start by detect out the real reasons that people do n't already listen to it. The main thing that I think will CMV : -Compelling examples of features people like about popular euphony that are unique to popular euphony. Not characteristic that are shared between both genres. I really want to find out what makes popular styles uniquely engaging to people in ways that classical euphony is not. TL ; DR : Classical music almost neer has a drumset to help keep really clear track of the time for the listener. People like feeling rhythmically grounded , and so popular manner are more accessible to a wider audience. how do you do , users of CMV ! This is a footnote from your moderators.

My view is that this approach is fundamentally unscientific and should not be held because it is based on probability and not actual scientific evidence. My background: I am a physics and astronomy teacher, and I teach about this subject in depth every year. I think about it and research it often. I'm well acquainted with the [Drake Equation] , the [Fermi Paradox] and [its many possible solutions] , the [Great Filter] , and the debate over alien life in general.

However, my opinion was strongly shifted by the book Alone in the Universe by [John Gribbin] , and I now think that the great profusion of life here on Earth is so rare that we are alone in the Universe. Don't get me wrong, I'm completely open to the idea of aliens existing. I kind of hope they do, as long as they don't destroy us all!

CMV. Edit 1: Some good thoughts in here, thanks. Also, some incorrect assumptions about what I'm saying. Probability is of course a useful scientific tool, the key to our understanding of quantum mechanics. But guesses about the Drake Equation boil down to probability based on no data, quite different from the data-based probability of QM. The most compelling argument that I've read below is that because we know life happened once in the Universe with us, it could happen again. Physical laws of symmetry point to the idea that there are no unique events in the Universe. I'm not sure I agree with that, but it's given me something to think about. And so the crux of the argument comes down to abiogenesis, life from non-life. Is it easy or hard? Could it have happened only once? Alone in the Universe argues that a LOT of things had to go just right for us to exist. I call these things'Drake's Denominator' in class the scores of things that went just right for us that might kill the huge totals of galaxies, stars, and planets.

Given that pedestrian walklights and train stoplights do n't have yellow lights either , it seem out of place. It should be a comparatively trivial task to rewrite signal control programs to not ever have the yellow lights turn on , and phasing out would be a gradual mental process. This would result in cost delivery. It also takes minimal re-education for drivers , since the yellow light is and then rarely used anyway. cmv. hullo , users of CMV !

{"original_text": "I agree with most of Bernie's domestic politics, but foreign policy is a critical aspect of the presidency and I don't think he has what it takes.

Working on international issues requires developing personal relationships, thus being good at making friends. I don't think he is like that. 2) It requires building alliance and persuading people. Bernie is an independent, does not have serious alliances or close friends in Congress despite being there for over two decades. He has not gotten any notable legislation passed. Would he really negotiate the best possible international treaties for the US? 3) A President needs to be able to understand and navigate everyone's goals.

{"original_text": "First, I want to clarify that I think civilian deaths are terrible. To be honest, it's probably pretty shitty for combatants to die as well. In that case, let's start from the assumption that I'm not a sociopath who doesn't care that people, from any side of the conflict, are dying. A few more assumptions that I, personally, have about the conflict: - Israel's attacks on civilian building are predominantly with the intent to destroy Hamas rockets, militants or other assets. - Israel has the right to defend itself from attacks from an outside actor, whether it is a state or a non-state organization. - The state of Israel's primary obligation is to the security and safety of its own population. I think it is also worth noting that I believe there are certainly instances of Israel acting terribly and with undue force, but my argument should only be taken in support of their generals strategy of hitting civilian structures if there are missile installations even if there are civilians, not instances that do not fall within that category (e.g. killing children on a beach). Finally my argument. The current discourse coming from Israel about their attacks are that their hands are tied when it comes to hitting civilian populated buildings because those building are where Hamas missile attack originate from. I agree with that statement. I think that Israel is justified in destroying that building because of the threat that the rockets pose to its own civilians. I think that Israel gives at least some warning (arguably insufficient), and I think that there have been quite a few instances of Hamas urging civilians to stay inside buildings even if those warnings are given. Given that, I believe that despite the indescribable tragedy of civilian deaths, Israel is justified in defending its own population by destroying those missile installations. Time for some preempts: 1. \"But Palestinians have no where to go because they have no bomb shelters and their country is blockaded.\" On the question of bomb shelters, I don't think, as harsh as it sounds, it is Israel's fault that bomb shelters don't exist. Further, there's plenty of fairly well-founded arguments that show Hamas had the capabilities and resources to build bomb shelters given the tunnels they created. On the question of the border blockade, I think it is important to note that Israel is not the only country enforcing the blockade, cough cough Egypt. I also think that its reasonable for the Israeli government to believe that easing the blockade may allow Hamas to increase its capabilities. I do, however, think that this is the easiest place to change my mind given my limited knowledge of the intricacies surrounding the blockade and that the main reason I support it is because of the current escalating conflict (if you asked me a couple months ago, I probably would have disagreed with it). 2. \"But the death toll is incredibly disproportionate and favors the Israelis heavily.\" This is a certainly indisputable, and I would fall flat on my face trying to figure out and argue how many lives a missile installation is worth because that argument, in and of itself, is morally reprehensible. However, I would say that the number of the civilians killed doesn't and shouldn't matter to the Israeli STATE. I emphasize \"state\" because killing that many people should make an individual feel like utter shit regardless of reason. For the disembodied entity known as the state, however, it must fulfill its primary obligation of protecting its own citizens. Therefore, any lethal threat to its citizens can be rightfully destroyed. The logical conclusion I can't shake here is that there is no way I can tell the Israeli government to stop destroying missile installations even if there is an extremely low chance of its own civilians dying because their people, admittedly a small number, have died in the past from rocket attacks and could die from them in the future as well. 3. \"That Iron Dome is pretty awesome.\" Yeah, it is pretty great! Sadly, the number I've heardseen is that it is able to stop 90 of rocket attacks from Hamas. At what percentage do you stop destroying wherever the rockets are being fired from? If there is just a 5 chance of a rocket getting through, do you call it quits? If the Israeli government answers yes to that question and one of their citizens dies from a rocket attack, what happens then? Three questions in a row probably isn't the best form of argument I could have use, but I hope my point gets across. Lastly, I obviously welcome anything that can change my view on this subject because, honestly, I feel like a fucked up human being condoning the death of others. However, I would ask of anyone who responds, please provide some type of alternative action for the Israeli government to take in you argument. I am fully aware that, in a vacuum, attacking a civilian-populated building is bad, but what is your suggestion of something else they can do? Hello, users of CMV!

{"original_text": "In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me. I was born here in the US but I am of Chinese and Thai descent. As a child I grew up not really caring at all about race, I just sort of assumed humans came is all different colors and shapes and that was normal. I didn't even know there were names for the different races and ethnicities. The only thing I was really aware of was if people actually came from a different country. As I grew older, my classmates and I were bombarded with racial messages during school and everywhere else. We were taught that white people were somehow inherently racist. We were taught that everyone else was perfect and every bad thing they did throughout history was somehow righteous and justified. I started to see lines forming. White kids were told that they were somehow responsible for everything some people in the past did. Black kids were taught that they were owed something. I noticed kids start self-segregating. It wasn't anything dramatic, no one attributed this to the things we were being taught, but people knew they were different now. I grew older still. I started paying attention to the news and the internet,. Race was discussed alot. I learned about affirmative action and it made my blood boil. If you didn't know, Asians are hurt the most by affirmative action. I would need a MUCH higher SAT score and GPA than a black person to get into the schools of my choice. I started to resent black people for this. Why was I being hurt because an entire race was apparently performing poorly and my entire race wasn't? And if discrimination was the reason, well my race was discriminated against in the past too! This was opinion shared by my friends. It led us to think that if this was the case, black people didn't try very much and were lazy in school. Otherwise why would they need help? I was infuriated to learn that a black girl who took all level classes and wasn't even close to the top of the class was accepted into my first choice college while I was not, despite my excellent grades and test scores. When I went to college, I made sure to avoid going to black doctors and other black professionals for fear than they got their position due to unfair preferences. I learned about the black crime rate, and prison population. I started to become scared when I saw a black person on the streets. All the commentary about how this was racist merely solidified my opinion. I saw how violent black neighborhoods are, I was catcalled constantly by black men in the streets, I worked in a leasing office and saw black tenants who lived entirely off the government and complained about everything. If I hadn't heard about race my entire life I would have written all these off as \"Man those specific people suck\" rather than lump the entire race together. People address these issues as if everyone else is to blame for these peoples actions, instead of saying hey, those are just bad people. Instead they make it a race thing where those bad people are actually VICTIMS. I heard about the police shootings and the publicity around them. I heard about the riots, and the more people talked about how the senseless destruction was justified the more I distanced myself and the more scared I became. I started to involuntarily see black people as a threat. My friends all secretly talked about how they wished all these people would go back to Africa so we could all live in peace. In the past couple years after all the discussion about race I have seen SOO many non-black people become essentially racist, and so many wonderful black people become entitled and vitriolic. So basically, I feel like if we brought our kids up to not see color and talk about Americans as Americans, rather than african-american, asian american, etc, racism would soon become a thing of the past. If we keep bringing up race in EVERYTHING, kids start drawing lines and lumping people together as their race, rather than as Americans. They start noticing and being hyper-aware of differences between races. Crying racism in every situation just annoys people and defeats the goal of ending racism. Racial and diversity programs make people resentful, and make the benefitting parties feel entitled. People should be chosen on merit alone. \"Not seeing color\" is treated as ignorant and is laughed at, but I feel that this is the best way to operate if we are ever going to solve our problems. I'd like other opinions on this because the way I see the world right now truly sickens me. I don't want to keep feeling like I am different because I am Asian, I want to feel American and be okay with the way people talk about race. I want to feel okay with the way we as Americans are dealing with these issues. I also want to understand why \"not seeing color\" is ridiculed.", "text_perturb": "In this post I make up going to be very blunt.

As a child I grew up not really caring at all about race , I just sort of assumed humans descend is all different colors and shapes and that was normal. I did n't even know there exist names for the different races and ethnicities. The lone thing I was really aware of was if people actually came from a different country. As I grew older , my classmates and I exist bombarded with racial messages during school and everywhere else. We were instruct that white people were somehow inherently racist. We were taught that everyone else was consummate and every bad thing they did throughout history was somehow righteous and justified. I come out to see lines forming. White youngster were told that they were somehow responsible for everything some people in the past did. Black kids were taught that they were owed something. I comment kids start self-segregating. It was n't anything dramatic , no one attributed this to the things we were being teach , but people knew they were different now. I grew sure enough still. I started paying attending to the news and the internet ,. wash was discussed alot. I learned about affirmative action mechanism and it made my blood boil. If you did n't know , Asians personify hurt the most by affirmative action. I would need a MUCH higher SAT score and GPA than a black person to get into the school day of my choice. I started to begrudge black people for this. Why was I being hurt because an entire backwash was apparently performing poorly and my entire backwash was n't ? And if discrimination was the reason , well my backwash was discriminated against in the past too ! This was opinion shared by my friends. It led us to think that if this was the case , black citizenry did n't try very much and were lazy in school. Otherwise why would they need help ? I was infuriated to learn that a black girl who took all level classes and was n't even close to the top of the stratum was accepted into my first choice college while I was not , despite my excellent grades and test scores. When I went to college , I made sure to avoid going to contraband doctors and other contraband professionals for fear than they got their position due to unfair preferences. I learned about the black offense rate , and prison population. I started to become scared when I saw a black person on the street. All the commentary about how this was racialist merely solidified my opinion. I saw how violent black neighborhoods are , I was catcall constantly by black men in the streets , I worked in a leasing office and saw black tenants who lived entirely off the government and complained about everything. If I had n't pick up about race my entire life I would have written all these off as `` Man those specific people suck '' rather than lump the entire race together. People address these issues as if everyone else is to find fault for these peoples actions , instead of saying hey , those are just bad people. Instead they make it a race thing where those bad people are in reality VICTIMS. I heard about the police shooting and the publicity around them. I heard about the riots , and the more than people talked about how the senseless destruction was justified the more I distanced myself and the more than scared I became. I set forth to involuntarily see black people as a threat. My friends all secretly talked about how they wished all these hoi polloi would go back to Africa so we could all live in peace. In the past couple years after all the discussion about race I have seen SOO many non-black people become essentially racist , and so many wonderful sinister people become entitled and vitriolic. So basically , I feel like if we institute our kids up to not see color and talk about Americans as Americans , rather than african-american , asian american , etc , racism would soon become a thing of the past. If we keep bringing up race in EVERYTHING , kids start pull out lines and lumping people together as their race , rather than as Americans. They start noticing and being hyper-aware of differences between race. Crying racism in every situation just annoys people and defeats the end of ending racism. Racial and diversity programs make people resentful , and make the benefitting parties feel entitle. hoi polloi should be chosen on merit alone. `` Not reckon color '' is treated as ignorant and is laughed at , but I feel that this is the best way to operate if we are ever going to solve our problems. I 'd like other opinions on this because the path I see the world right now truly sickens me. I do n't want to keep feeling like I am different because I am asian , I want to feel American and be okay with the way people talk about race. I desire to feel okay with the way we as Americans are dealing with these issues. I also want to sympathize why `` not seeing color '' is ridiculed. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "First of all, I want to first express how happy I am with this subreddit. It has always been a hub for civilized discussion on complicated and difficult topics. I have never witnessed uncivilized discussion on here before and I'm glad to be a part of the community. Good job, Reddit! With that said, if you are unfamiliar with the sexual revolution I am referring to, this is a time beginning in the 1960s where people experienced an \"urge to'find oneself Wikipedia] . During this time, lots of previously taboo'd sexually related acts, ideals, etc entered into society and have more recently, at the end of the 20th century have thoroughly integrated themselves into it. This involves a large variety of things including but not limited to: proliferation and normalization of pornography, sex before marriage, acceptance of sexually explicit movietelevision material, contraceptions, and the LGBT movement. For example, pornography, which was formerly unheard of in public conversation is now often not only discussed, but glorified and upheld as a great thing. This is just one example of what I am talking about. I am not arguing the moralities of pornography however. My argument: The recent decision by the Supreme Court to rule in favor of gay marriage is simply the next step in the sexual revolution and essentially negates some of the arguments against the next step after this; I am specifically referring to incestuous relationships, and other ways of \"loving\" someone. However, I will mainly refer to incest for the sake of a shorter discussion. One of the main arguments against gay marriage is that it is \"unnatural.\" One could also argue that incest is unnatural, but even more broadly, any sexual relationship outside of marriage between a man and woman can be argued effectively as unnatural. Gay marriage activists very frequently champion progressive thinking and non-discrimination as basis for legalizing gay marriage. The term progressive is very open for interpretation, but eliminating discrimination is very straight forward. If someone named Cercei loves her brother named Jamie, should it be allowed? Should they be allowed to marry and procreate? Incestuous relationships very often breed deformities and retardations in children; should these children be forced to have an incomplete, handicapped life on the basis of equality. For more information on incest please view this very informative [documentary] . Another argument against gay marriage has frequently been that it further inhibits the ability for the human race to procreate. This is fairly obvious as to why people say this: a man and a man cannot bear a child and vice versa. However, the same argument stands for incest; in fact, it is worse. Incestuous relationships don't further the human species, but rather they turn it backwards by corrupting genes and eliminating diversity. Also, as previously stated, incest often results in retardation in the resulting child. With gay marriage legalized officially, these arguments become unsubstantial and hypocritical to argue with against incest. In conclusion, my fear is that the sexual revolution has the potential to continue to progress and eventually today's taboos will become everyday occurrences all on the basis of equality and non-discrimination. This has the potential to effect humans on not only a genetic level by potentially allowing incest to corrupt human genetic material and cause genetic disorders, but also on a societal level where humans become more concerned with catering to someones sexual identitypreference rather than the actual person inside. I believe this could be devastating to humans. I don't claim to know what would happen, but it isn't too difficult to come up with a worst-case scenario of what society could become when the main focus of peoples interactions is politically correctness, being non-offensive, and catering to every form of person on a sexual basis. Please feel free to ask questions and I will be happy to clarify. CMV, Tresky Disclaimer: I am in no way attempting to say that gay marriage in and of itself is causing the downfall of humanity and am not attempting to demonize or put-down members of the LGBT community.

{"original_text": "I'm not asking anything about why we self harm - trust me I've got many answers for that. My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is bad, but no one can give me a logical argument for why. So far this is the logic I've heard again and again: Self harm is bad because it is dangerous. It is dangerous because you could die, or could get an infection. The problem I have seen with this is that you can replace \"self harm\" with so many other things and still follow the same basic structure. Lacrosse is bad because it is dangerous. It is dangerous because you could get a concussion. Cooking is bad because it is dangerous. You could get burned. Taking Lithium for Bipolar Disorder is bad because it is dangerous. It is dangerous because it could give you kidney failure. So I can not accept the false-logic of dangerous bad. That means anything dangerous is inherently bad, and that is not true. It is very easy to self harm without any danger. Sterilize tools, clean and cover wounds, etcetera. Of course this can still leave permanent scars, but so can getting a tattoo or a piercing, so once again, self harm isn't inherently bad just because it leaves scars. Lots of things leave scars, so scars aren't what's bad about it. Okay, but it's a symptom of a bigger problem. Yes. And the bigger problem is the thing that should be fixed.

{"original_text": "Whenever I book air travel, I always sit in a window seat, and I contend that the window seat is the far superior seat in almost every way. 1) The views are amazing. The majority of people even 50 years ago had not had the ability to travel by air due to its high cost, and therefore lacked the ability to see the amazing views afforded by sitting at the window of a jet airplane. In my travels, I've been able to look down at the glaciers and coasts of Greenland, see the Grand Canyon from the air, look down on Niagara Falls, appreciate the rolling green hills of New Zealand, and behold the grandeur of the Rocky Mountains. And this is all in less than a decade of regular air travel, and I'm not even counting the fact that just about EVERY view from the air is amazing, even if it's just the cornfields of Nebraska. The longer I keep flying, the more amazing perspective about the beauty and scale of our planet I will be able to appreciate. 2) A place to rest your head to nap. When you have an overnight flight, or a really early flight, and you just need to catch some extra ZZZs on the plane, the window seat is the best place to be because you can ball up your jacket and use it as a pillow against the wall. 3) Elbow and foot protection. The few times I've been unfortunate enough to sit in the aisle seat, I almost always get bumped on my elbow or foot by the drink cart coming down the aisle. It's just such a narrow aisle, and the cart takes up the entire width, that it's bound to hit you at some point, especially if your shoulders are a little wider, or if you're engrossed in a book or headphones and can't hear them asking everyone to move. In the window seat, this is never a problem and you don't risk getting bumped. 4) Control of the window shade. Sometimes it does get really bright outside, and in that case, the person in the window seat has complete control over how high or low to keep the shade. You get to set it at the level that's comfortable for YOU. 5) Not having to get up to let others in during boarding. When I get on the plane, I like to sit down and use those few minutes to answer some emails or text messages, or (admittedly) scroll through Reddit's front page a bit. When sitting in a window seat, once you're seated, you're done. You can sit there uninterrupted for the whole duration of boarding. If you're seated in the aisle or middle, you run the risk of being interrupted and having to stand up, clog the crowded aisle, and losing time to do the things you were doing while waiting for boarding. Now I'll admit there are a couple problems with the window seat: 1) No easy access to lavatory. You have to ask two other people to get up when you need to use the bathroom. However, I think that with some good advance planning, one can use the bathroom in the terminal and not have to use it at all on a shorter flight. For longer flights, is it really that bad to have to ask someone to get up for a minute to let you out? They know you'll need to go at some point, so as long as it isn't every 20 minutes, I think it's totally fine. And if it really bothers you to inconvenience strangers, you can wait until the middle seat person needs to use the lavatory, and then just go at that point when the aisle person is already getting up. 2) Can't stand up when the plane parks to get your luggage first andor stretch your legs. But this doesn't seem like such a problem. I mean, you've just been seated for a number of hours on the flight...what's 10 more minutes? Just wait patiently for the aisle to clear, then grab your bag. In summary: I believe the window seat is clearly the superior choice when flying. It's not perfect, but on balance, it affords the most interesting scenery, the most comfort, and the most convenience. The reason I'd be interested to have my view changed is for those times when I may be stuck in an aisle seat for reasons outside my control, and I'd like to know the reasons why it's not so bad to have to sit on the aisle and not feel like my entire flying experience is ruined by not getting the window seat. I think we can all agree that sitting in the middle seat is an unsatisfying and degrading experience in every possible way. Edit: a word Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Happy CMVing!", "text_perturb": "Whenever I book air travel , I always sit in a window seat , and I contend that the window seat is the far superior seat in near every way. 1 ) The sight are amazing. The majority of people even 50 years ago own not own the ability to travel by air due to its high cost , and therefore lacked the ability to see the amazing views afforded by sitting at the window of a jet airplane. In my travels , I 've been able to look down at the glaciers and coasts of Greenland , see the Grand canon from the air , look down on Niagara Falls , appreciate the rolling green hills of New Zealand , and behold the grandeur of the Rocky Mountains. And this is all in less than a decade of regular air travel , and I 'm not even counting the fact that precisely about EVERY view from the air is amazing , even if it 's precisely the cornfields of Nebraska. The longer I retain flying , the more amazing perspective about the beauty and scale of our planet I will be able to appreciate. 2 ) A office to rest your head to nap. When you have an overnight flight , or a really early flight , and you just need to catch some extra ZZZs on the plane , the window seat is the best place to comprise because you can ball up your jacket and use it as a pillow against the wall. 3 ) Elbow and foot shelter. The few times I 've been unfortunate enough to sit in the aisle seat , I almost always sire bumped on my elbow or foot by the drink cart coming down the aisle. It 's just such a narrow gangway , and the cart takes up the entire width , that it 's bound to hit you at some point , especially if your shoulders are a little wider , or if you 're engrossed in a book or headphones and ca n't hear them asking everyone to move. In the window seat , this is never a problem and you do n't risk make bumped. 4 ) Control of the window tint. Sometimes it does get really bright outside , and in that case , the person in the window seat hold complete control over how high or low to keep the shade. You get to set it at the spirit level that 's comfortable for YOU. 5 ) Not having to get up to countenance others in during boarding. When I beat on the plane , I like to sit down and use those few minutes to answer some emails or text messages , or ( admittedly ) scroll through Reddit 's front page a bit. When sit around in a window seat , once you 're seated , you 're done. You can sit there uninterrupted for the unhurt duration of boarding. If you 're seated in the aisle or middle , you prevail the risk of being interrupted and having to stand up , clog the crowded aisle , and losing time to do the things you were doing while waiting for boarding. nowadays I 'll admit there are a couple problems with the window seat : 1 ) No easy access to lavatory. You have to involve two other people to get up when you need to use the bathroom. However , I think that with some good betterment planning , one can use the bathroom in the terminal and not have to use it at all on a shorter flight. For longer flights , is it really that bad to have to ask someone to get up for a minute to let you out ? They know you 'll need to go at some pointedness , so as long as it is n't every 20 minutes , I think it 's totally fine. And if it really bothers you to inconvenience strangers , you can wait until the middle seat someone needs to use the lavatory , and then just go at that point when the aisle someone is already getting up. 2 ) Ca n't stand up when the plane parks to get your luggage for the first time andor stretch your legs. But this does n't seem like such a trouble. I mean , you 've just been seated for a number of hours on the flight of steps. . . what 's 10 more minutes ? Just wait patiently for the aisle to solve , then grab your bag. In summary : I believe the window seat is clearly the ranking choice when flying. It 's not everlasting , but on balance , it affords the most interesting scenery , the most comfort , and the most convenience. The reason I 'd be interested to have my view changed is for those times when I may be stuck in an aisle seat for reasons outside my control , and I 'd wish to know the reasons why it 's not so bad to have to sit on the aisle and not feel like my entire flying experience is ruined by not getting the window seat. I think we can all agree that sitting in the middle seat is an disappointing and degrading experience in every possible way. Edit : a christian bible Hello , users of CMV !

(See this article for more info:) Now, while I agree that pay gaps are a problem in general some fields, sports is a different ballgame (no pun intended).

{"original_text": "Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and I encourage all men who have been sexually abused to immediately seek help, but I have trouble feeling as bad for men who are raped and it's hard for me to weigh the impact of that rape on their lives. The reason is because whenever I think of women getting raped, I think of a strong (and sometimes old) man who clearly has power of a much weaker woman forcing her to do things that she finds derogatory. The fact that women are the prominent gender in the sex slave trade doesn't help. That only makes me feel like a man raping a woman is essentially treating her like property and belittling her humanity. Also, although I can't prove this scientifically, we all know at least that society views men as horny fucks who are out there just to fuck women. This evokes some feeling in me that women are men's \"prey\" and they are the victims who have to put up with this feeling of worthlessness. Whenever I think of a man getting raped however, I think of a guy who has had a little too much to drink and is being coerced into sex by a woman who finds him attractive. Yeah, he may not want to have sex with her, and yeah at that point he is way too weak to resist, but because he's a man, there's something inside of me that feels like he can deal with this and it's simply just another night that didn't go so well. Now as for gay men, that's different and I can sympathize with them more, especially if they were the ones who were penetrated. Even though I feel that way with gays, I still don't think of rape of gay men as bad as rape of women. I guess I may see being penetrated unwillingly as worse than having to penetrate someone against your will. But the fact that toughness and security are associated with males and feebleness and innocence are associated with women also doesn't help. I really do hate my stance on this because I like to think of myself as a benevolent person who wants the common good for everyone.

{"original_text": "Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times by taking EPO andwhen a test for EPO was developedby taking blood transfusions during the race to increase his red blood-cell levels. He passed all of the blood tests (shy one, where the story of using a particular ointment for saddle-sores was concocted to explain it). Doping in one form or another is always going to happen, and there will always be another method that can escape detection. If you're a professional athlete, or an amateur competing in high profile tournaments such as the Olympics, then you either dope or you face a significant disadvantage. I don't think this will ever change, and the consequence is that every winner will be tainted by doubt, so I think the only way to address this is to change the policy to allow specific types of doping. Ball-shrinking, liver wrecking, life endangering drugs would still be banned for the safety of the athlete, but anything that's either harmless (blood transfusions), or at the same level as \"professional hazard\" (like brain damage for boxers), would be allowed. One of the things that encourage me to have this view, and that I'd like addressed if it's wrong, is my understanding that the IOC relaxed their criteria for gender verification. The reason, as I understand it, is that there were simply too many legitimate side cases, so the hardline rule couldn't be enforced. Someone genetically male might have Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome or XXXXY mosaicism, for example, and grow up looking like a woman to anyone but a gene lab. One form of gender identification, which was mandated for all female olympic athletes by the International Olympic Committee in 1992, tested for the presence of the SRY gene, which is found on the Y-chromosome, to identify males potentially disguised as females. This method of testing was later abolished, as it was shown to be inconclusive in identifying maleness. From Wikipedia: Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

He passed all of the blood exam ( shy one , where the story of using a particular ointment for saddle-sores was concocted to explain it ). Doping in one form or another is always going to happen , and there will always be another method that send away escape detection. If you 're a professional athlete , or an amateur competing in high profile tournaments such as the olympic games , then you either dope or you face a significant disadvantage. I do n't think this will ever change , and the consequence is that every winner will be tainted by doubt , so I think the only elbow room to address this is to change the policy to allow specific types of doping. Ball-shrinking , liver wrecking , life endangering drugs would still be banish for the safety of the athlete , but anything that 's either harmless ( blood transfusions ) , or at the same level as `` professional hazard '' ( like brain damage for boxers ) , would be allowed. One of the things that encourage me to have this view , and that I 'd care addressed if it 's wrong , is my understanding that the IOC relaxed their criteria for gender verification. The reason , as I infer it , is that there were simply too many legitimate side cases , so the hardline rule could n't be enforced. Someone genetically male might have Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome or XXXXY mosaicism , for example , and grow up looking like a cleaning woman to anyone but a gene lab. One form of gender identification , which was mandated for all female olympic athletes by the international Olympic Committee in 1992 , tested for the presence of the SRY gene , which is found on the Y-chromosome , to identify males potentially disguised as females. This method of testing was later abolished , as it was shown to be inconclusive in identify maleness. From Wikipedia : Hello , users of CMV ! This is a footer from your moderators.

{"original_text": "Right off the bat, let me reformulate my title in a more nuanced way. While I'm not an opponent of same-sex marriage (SSM), I feel the arguments employed in its favor have been somewhat disingenuous. I don't feel parallels drawn to the civil rights movement stand up under close scrutiny. If there is any merit to the claim that SSM is about equal rights, and I don't rule that out, then I think there is, when you follow the logic, a tacit admission that the \"slippery slope\" argument of SSM opponents has a point. Perhaps phrasing things in terms of \"equal rights\" is necessary for enacting political change, but I don't think this stands up as a reason for allowing same-sex couples to marry in the first place. Let me outline what I think are the problems with the \"equal rights\" formulation, and then explain what I think is the real issue regarding SSM. For my purposes here I conflate \"SSM advocates\" with \"SSM advocates who say their fight is about marriage equality.\" (how many of the first group are not in the second group anyway?) The equal rights formulation is usually put in the form: why don't homosexual couples have the same right to get married as heterosexual couples? The first problem with this formulation is that couples don't have rights, individuals have rights. What is the individual right at stake here? SSM advocates say it's the right to marry the person you love, or it's a more nebulous right to marry whoever you want. Both of these versions of rights are enjoyed by heterosexuals by default given their preferences, while homosexuals are denied these rights given theirs. Call these the RML and RMC (shorthand for \"right to marry who you Love\" and \"right to marry who you Choose. The idea of a RMC or a RMC is on shaky grounding. Historically there's been a plainer \"right to marry\" which hasn't been been widely articulated in these more refined forms. In particular a RML is a modern idealistic version of marriage. This undermines the argument of SSM advocates that marriage pre-dates Christianity, in particular, and religions more generally; yes it does, but that historical version of marriage is not the RML or RMC versions they invoke when they call for equality. To some extent it's an argument formulated just to refute religion-based criticisms of SSM, but it still illustrates that SSM advocates are hinging their case on an alleged right that has only been articulated in modern times and is not enshrined in law, in order to turn it around and say homosexuals are being denied this right. One might fairly ask what is the rational basis for opposing a RML or RMC. I don't think there is a good reason for opposing these, but this does not constitute sufficient reason to favor them. In fact I'd say asserting these rights without a meaningful grounding is rather reckless. Besides inviting uncomfortable questions like \"why should my love for my dog not be recognized by RML?,\" there are a multitude of other hypothetical rights one similarly cannot rationally oppose. For instance: \"What's wrong with a right to marry the person I wish to have as my roommate? We don't love each other or anything. But we like living together, and we ask that the state recognize our relationship, while not a romantic relationship, as a marriage, no better or worse than the marriages of others. The tax benefits are a plus, but that's just icing on the cake. Anyway, it's not up to me to say why I want this right, it's on you to explain why I should be denied this right.\" How do \"equal rights\" advocates for SSM dispute the existence of a right to marry your roommate? Ridicule is not an argument. I think this is difficult without slipping, shall we say, into arguments that sound like those of SSM opponents. And this claimed \"right,\" in either the RML or RMC form, is muddied by its inherent caveats, such as restrictions on marrying one's sibling. (Before you jump in and say incest is illegal for genetic reasons, marriage need not imply the creation of children. As an aside, I think \"marriage equality\" advocates, the first to dismiss a procreative rationale for marriage, have not honestly engaged the question of why non-procreative incestuous marriage should not be permitted). Is it ok to assert a right that is riddled with exemptions? There are other examples of rights we draft caveats to, such as the second amendment and the right to vote. But these other examples are rights that do have a well-respected legal basis. Their caveats are dressings to accommodate them to practice and to our day and age. SSM advocates, however, bring to the steps of government a request for a new right, a RML or a RMC, and then under further questioning it's revealed that is the request is more accurately characterized as \"the right to marry the human being you wish, who is older than an arbitrarily set consenting age, who is at a required genetic distance from oneself, provided both you and your partner are not currently married.\" Why is that right superior to, or more natural than, the status quo \"the right to marry the human being you wish of the opposite gender, who is older than an arbitrarily set consenting age, who is at a required genetic distance from oneself, provided both you and your partner are not currently married\"? To put it in more concrete terms, how exactly do you respond to SSM opponents who say \"You already have equal rights. Everyone has the equal right to marry someone of the opposite gender\"? At some level they have a point there. From where are \"marriage equality\" advocates drawing a different kind of equal right? What is the logical distinction between the right asserted by SSM advocates and a proposed \"right to marry whoever you like to have as a roommate\"? Perhaps I've already made it clear what I think the push for same-sex marriage is actually about. It's about expanding the definition of marriage to loosen one of several of its existing restrictions. Inconveniently for advocates, this formulation is not particularly inspiring and it aligns with popular arguments against same-sex marriage. But expanding a definition need not be an intrinsically disqualifying, as many opponents blithely suggest. Why loosen the gender restriction on marriage and not the species, age, familial, or monogamous restrictions? Because there is heavy demand to loosen the gender restriction and little demand to loosen those other restrictions. That's it. Why not allow people to marry their roommate? This gets tricky even for me. On the one hand, if there was a lot of demand for such a privilege, we should allow it. If there's just a little demand, however, it gets classified as something society is not comfortable with, yet. The arguments against it do sound a lot like arguments against SSM (which is not a necessarily a problem, because it's not a matter of rights). Perhaps we treat marriage as too sacred a thing to sully with non-romantic meanings, for no good reason than that we do. I suspect there's a deep well of political philosophy here I'm not qualified to jump into, involving the complicated relationship between social norms and the way we interpret law. I'll just leave this as a gaping logical hole in a position essay that is too long as it is. My argument for SSM goes like this: there is a lot of sincere demand to expand the definition of marriage in this particular way. It would normalize the romantic relationships of a significant portion of our populace and provide benefits to those who were effectively cut off from them previously. Plus, there is essentially no cost to expanding the definition (one could quibble about lost tax revenue) and little in the way of non-religious reasons for not expanding the definition. So why not? If we have the political power we can and should push for the kind of society we wish to have. That's what's at stake, and nothing more. We shouldn't delude ourselves with fantasies about the nature of the fight. Perhaps this thought experiment is useful: On Earth2 is the country USA2, which is identical to us in every way except for two things. One, there are very few homosexuals, maybe 0.00001 of the population are homosexuals. Two, 10 of the population of USA2 have a sincere romantic attachment to animals. Not outright bestiality, but just people who find deeply fulfilling relationships with their pet that crowds out any desire to have a relationship with another human being. In USA2 there is very little demand for SSM. Homosexuality is still considered deviant and the idea of two dudes marrying still seems absurd in the popular culture. But at the same time there is lots of demand from sincere people who wish to have their relationship with their animal recognized as the equivalent of human marriage. In USA2 the idea of animal marriage (AM) has been made more and more acceptable by an extended political campaign and prominent celebrities who are deeply attached to animals. The arguments in favor of AM have also invoked a \"right to marry who you love,\" a phrase that still carries the unstated assumption that, in the case of humans, obviously we you marry the opposite gender, in the same way our notion of \"the right to marry who you love\" carries the unstated assumption that this excludes animals. In both USA and USA2, the two political campaigns for the two new types of marriage both claim they're fighting for equal rights, in apparent ignorance of the possibility of the kind of right conceived in the other USA. If SSM is about equal rights, what precisely is the fallacy in the \"equal rights\" claimed by the AM campaign in USA2? My answer is both claims to \"equal rights\" are fallacious, in both cases there is demand to change the definition of marriage, and that's nothing to be ashamed of. I'll state upfront, if my position here is vulnerable, it's probably because of a convoluted notion of what civil rights are or should be, as I don't have any real formal experience in these questions. But I'm eager to hear where I've stepped wrong, as the political debate on SSM has not, for obvious reasons, catered to my perhaps unusual interpretation of the issue.", "text_perturb": "Right off the bat , countenance me reformulate my title in a more nuanced way.

If SSM constitute about equal rights , what precisely constitute the fallacy in the `` equal rights '' claimed by the AM campaign in USA2 ? My answer constitute both claims to `` equal rights '' are fallacious , in both cases there constitute demand to change the definition of marriage , and that 's nothing to be ashamed of. I 'll state upfront , if my position here is vulnerable , it 's probably because of a convoluted notion of what civil rights are or should be , as I do n't have any real formal experience in these dubiousness. But I 'm eager to hear where I 've stepped wrong , as the political debate on SSM possess not , for obvious reasons , catered to my perhaps unusual interpretation of the issue. ", "label": 1}
{"original_text": "I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with why I find eating meat at all to be morally justifiable. I only buy meat from free-roam organic farms, which are clearly labeled here in Denmark. If I eat one of the cows I see on the outskirts of my city, happily roaming and eating grass, I don't really feel guilty. They get to experience a reasonably long, happy and healthy life. We also have pigs that are allowed to roam free in the forest. We give them a safe environment, and their lives end up on average longer and happier than they would be in the wild. So imagine if an alien species came to earth and says: \"Hey, we'll create a post-scarcity society for you. All your life you will be in perfect health. You (as in all humans) will never want for anything, you will get all your favorite food and you get to play video games all day or whatever it is you want to do. But when you reach the age of 50, we will kill you in a humane way and then we will eat your corpse.\" I would find that to be a good deal. It would remove world hunger, there is no need to fight for resources. No diseases killing young people, no genetic defects. Not even having to work or do anything you don't want. And you would still get a reasonably long life to enjoy. And now we get to lamb meat. These guys are killed at 1 month to 1 year, which is in the best case less then 110th of their lives. They don't get to enjoy their lives. In my alien analogy, it would be like making the deal \"Yeah some of you get to live until 50, but some of you we will take and eat at 5,\" which suddenly becomes less acceptable. What would change my view: Somehow making my alien analogy work for eating humans at 5 Giving me another compelling moral argument for why eating lamb meat is ok. What will NOT change my view: The \"Animals are made for human consumption so they don't matter\" argument. Well yes, but they are also intelligent agents capable of feeling pain and suffering. An alien species with superior technology and intelligence could decide that \"Humans are made for alien consumption,\" and enslave our species, keeping us in cages all our lives. That would be horrible. So even if they are less intelligent and feel suffering differently, it does not give us the right to harm them for no good reason. We as a species get to decide which animals are for human consumption and which aren't, and what conditions we keep them in. The \"we evolved to eat meat\" argument. Yes, and we can eat chicken, pork and beef. No need to eat lamb even if a vegetarian diet was insufficient. Sorry for the long post. I realize it may be a bit tricky, but I really really want my guilt-free lamb roast. So there you have it, my first ever CMV:) EDIT: Thank you all for the replies! So this has been addressed from 2 perspectives, that got me to change my view: 1. If we go with the alien analogy, if they were to take some human cells and clone some humans on their home world, let them play happily on a field until they are 5, and then slaughter them for food, how immoral would that really be? The children would accept it as the status-quo and enjoy their lives, as they are too young to understand all the ramifications. No parents would have to part from their children, thus causing more suffering. 2. On the other side, it has been shown that other animals are slaughtered at an even younger age, so my view is inconsistent. Pigs, who are a lot more intelligent than lambs, usually get killed at 5 months. Milk cows are parted from their young as soon as they are born, and the calves get killed quite often only after a few weeks. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental physiological differences between men and women that feminists appear to disregard. Now, in my opinion feminism seeks to advocate that anything that men can do, women can also but only when its convenient. To me it seems like feminists want to have their cake and eat it too. I will give a few examples that I always think about to illustrate my point. 1. The Ray Rice incident. What happened was unfortunate and of course he shouldn't have hit his wife. However, if this was Ray hanging out with another football player and knocked him out, this would not have been a story. Its because he punched a woman that this became a big deal. How can the feminist movement suggest \"Men should NEVER lay their hands on a woman\" but still say that men and women are equal. My answer is that its because men are generally stronger than women, but then that's my point. If you are going to advocate that they are equal then they should receive equal treatment. Again, CMV. 2. Rape cases. In college I have been required to watch numerous sexual harassment videos and attend mandatory training seminars on sexual assault. In these videos they always paint the male as a bad guy and its always targeted towards men.

The guy is then facing rape charges. Why is this on the guy? People use the phrase \"Victim Blaming\" and say that its not on the girl regardless of the fact that she drunk. So what if she had gotten drunk and drove her car into a tree. Can she then say \"Maybe that wasn't a good idea\" and then get off the hook? 3. The draft. This one has also bothered me. According to the United States Selective Service Act, all men between ages 18-25 are required to register for the draft and may be picked for military service if the draft were to be implemented. Why are feminists all over the country not outraged about this? Shouldn't it be men AND women that are required to register for the draft? After all, men and women should be able to perform wartime duties equally right?

{"original_text": "Hi Reddit. With all the news over the past couple weeks regarding Caitlyn Jenner's transition and coming out, I feel now is a good time to discuss gender's role in society and its position in how people identify as an individual. I would like to preface myself by saying that I identify as a pansexual cis-male, and I certainly have zero issues with people that are transgendered. I do, however, get very confused as to why some people are transgendered. Many people use the phrase, \"I am a male trapped in a female's body,\" or, \"my body is male but my brain is female.\" What does this even mean? From a very young age, people are raised with ideas imposed upon us that dictate what boys are and what girls are, and these perceptions have nothing to do with the biological sex of someone and are typically based upon baseless stereotypical personality traits or what that gender should like to do. We are taught boys should play with toy cars and tools while girls are supposed to like barbies and dresses. These stereotypes are completely disparate from the reality that people are often multi-faceted, and might like many things across several disciplines and across several \"gender\" boundaries. I, personally, love to wrench my own car, build things, and in the same day I might decide to look totally different and wear makeup as an artistic outlet or go out shopping with friends to look at heels. These interests have nothing to do with my biological sex, and shouldn't have an affect on how I identify. Society has dictated that girls do certain things and boys do certain things. What does this mean when someone who is anatomically male tends to like a lot of the things that the opposite gender stereotypically likes? I think it's unfair to oneself to say, \"I like girl things so therefore I'm a girl,\" or, \"I like looking like a girl so I'm a girl.\" This idea of outward presentation equating to one's gender identity seems restrictive to me. I question how many people would identify as transgender if these societal norms became antiquated and everyone was truly free to express all sides of themselves regardless of physical sex. It should not be odd to be a very \"feminine\" person (makeup, hair, dress, etc) and be anatomically male and identify as a male despite one's outward aesthetic. There shouldn't even be an emphasis in society as to what gonads someone possesses. I believe far less people would identify as transgender, especially considering some people that are transgendered do not want sexual reassignment surgery, if we, as a society, were more open minded about individuality instead of trying to group people together based on their gender. If one doesn't even want to have SRS, but they want to live their life \"as a woman,\" how is this not simply perpetuating the heteronormative ideologies imposed upon us?

{"original_text": "Just to get this out of the way first, I'm not debating what the current law is, or if people should obey the law. I'm talking about what should be the case. Here's my logic: 1. Roads exist for the purpose of people getting around, not specifically for cars. The whole idea of \"jaywalking\" was a PR campaign put on by auto-makers. [Here's an article] that explains a bit about the PR campaign towards \"roads are for cars.\" 2. People in cities (myself included), use a bicycle as their primary commuter vehicle and means to get around the city. 3. Safety: Sometimes road conditions aren't safe for cyclists. If a car hits a bike, things are generally much much worse for the bike, so cyclists need the ability to ride safely. If there's a pothole, they need to be able to swerve, or to stop in a place where they have visibility, etc. EDIT: removing this. Multiple people have pointed out that it is legal to carefully avoid hazards in the road, so this isn't really relevant and is distracting from my main point, which is 4 4. Convenience is critical. Coming to a full stop at a stop sign, staying behind a stopped car (e.g. not lane splitting), and not being able to ride through crosswalks seriously impede the flow of bicycle traffic and make it take longer to get anywhere. The only reason we can ever justify driving 60 mph on a highway is for speed and convenience, and it matters just as much for cyclists as it does for drivers. In fact, for cyclists, at least they are only likely to kill themselves in an accident, where highway speed vehicles can take out other people. 5. More people biking is better for public health and the environment, and therefore should be encouraged, and following every car law discourages this 6. This is the weakest of all of the arguments, but people already aren't following some of these laws, because they deem the laws to be overly harsh. Having a set of laws more tailored for bicycles, or just granting certain exceptions to them, might encourage people to follow some of the laws that are really important, like passing on the left when a car may be turning right. I realize this is a bit of a cop-out, but I'm not specifying exactly what I think the laws should be, or how they should be applied. But it is my view that current road laws for cars should not apply to bicycles. I'm limiting this view to cities because it's the environment I'm most familiar with, and because cars are generally traveling faster and are less likely to expect bicycles outside the city. Also, transportation by bicycle may be less realistic when people have to travel further distances. EDIT: clarifications: The numbered points above are points of logic, they aren't each meant to individually address the CMV I'm not saying bicycles should have absolutely no rules laws at all, just that they shouldn't have to follow rules created for cars There's a trade-off between safety and speed (or convenience) in every form of transportation. Driving at highway speeds is insanely deadly and dangerous, but we tolerate it because it lets us travel further, faster. I'm just trying to apply a bit of that same logic to bicycles, allowing them to get ahead of traffic, not fully stop at stop signs, etc. Sure it's a bit less safe, but still potentially safer than commuting via car (not sure, would be interesting to look up some numbers on this). EDIT: more clarifications: I realize that existing laws provide good safety for bicycles (which is why I crossed out 3 above). I think the laws are too safe compared to the level of safety we expect from driving a car. People are accusing me of soap boxing because their repetitive arguments aren't convincing me. OK. I might be wrong, but I think that the laws aren't good. Try to convince me they are. Or don't. Your time is your own. I don't think I've been dismissive of anyones view or arguments, if you think I have, please point an example, because I don't want to come across this way. Since people keep repeating arguments, I want to address the top 3 here: 1. \"you're on our road, follow our rules.\" This is a non-argument. Yes, I understand the current laws. There is nothing holy about them, as in my jaywalking example above, they have changed before. As the use of roads is shifting again (towards more bicycles, for example), so should the laws. 2. \"The laws are for your own safety\" This is addressed above. I think they are too safe. It would be safer to never drive more than 20mph, but we don't do that 3. \"You should be predictable to other drivers.\" This is actually a good argument, but I think if there were some consistent set of rules for cyclists to follow and drivers were educated about those rules, we could achieve a good level of safety and a good compromise with speed and convince. EDIT: my view was (mostly) changed. [Here's the full comment] . Basically I was thinking about competent and aware cyclists who are commuting daily in a city, but I failed to consider the thousands of tourists and new cyclists and people who just don't know what they're doing.

This is the weakest of all of the arguments , but people already are n't following some of these natural law , because they deem the natural law to be overly harsh. Having a set of torah more tailored for bicycles , or just granting certain exceptions to them , might encourage people to follow some of the torah that are really important , like passing on the left when a car may be turning right. I realize this is a bit of a cop-out , but I 'm not specifying exactly what I think the jurisprudence should be , or how they should be applied. But it is my view that current road laws for cars should not apply to bike. I 'm limiting this view to cities because it 's the surround I 'm most familiar with , and because cars are generally traveling faster and are less likely to expect bicycles outside the city. Also , transportation by bicycle may be less realistic when people have to travel further distance. EDIT : clarifications : The numbered points above are points of logic , they are n't each meant to individually address the CMV I 'm not saying bicycles should have absolutely no rules laws at all , just that they should n't have to follow rules created for cars There 's a trade-off between safety and speed ( or gizmo ) in every form of transportation. Driving at highway speeds is insanely virulent and dangerous , but we tolerate it because it lets us travel further , faster. I 'm just trying to apply a bit of that same system of logic to bicycles , allowing them to get ahead of traffic , not fully stop at stop signs , etc. Sure it 's a spot less safe , but still potentially safer than commuting via car ( not sure , would be interesting to look up some numbers on this ). EDIT : more clarifications : I realize that exist laws provide good safety for bicycles ( which is why I crossed out 3 above ). I think the laws are too safe equate to the level of safety we expect from driving a car. People constitute accusing me of soap boxing because their repetitive arguments constitute n't convincing me. ok. I might be wrong , but I think that the laws constitute n't good. Try to win over me they are. Or do n't. Your time is your ain. I do n't think I 've been dismissive of anyones view or arguments , if you think I have , please point an representative , because I do n't want to come across this way. Since people keep repeating arguments , I want to turn to the top 3 here : 1. `` you 're on our road , follow our regulation. `` This is a non-argument. Yes , I understand the current laws. There cost nothing holy about them , as in my jaywalking example above , they have changed before. As the use of roads is shifting again ( towards more cycle , for example ) , so should the laws. 2. `` The laws are for your own safety '' This is direct above. I cogitate they are too safe. It would be secure to never drive more than 20mph , but we do n't do that 3. `` You should be predictable to early drivers. `` This is actually a good argument , but I think if there were some logical set of rules for cyclists to follow and drivers were educated about those rules , we could achieve a good level of safety and a good compromise with speed and convince. EDIT : my view was ( mostly ) changed. [ Here 's the full comment ]. Basically I was thinking about competent and aware cyclists who are commuting daily in a city , but I failed to consider the g of tourists and new cyclists and people who just do n't know what they 're doing. call for everyone to follow existing laws saves those people", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "This stemmed from a discussion I had on another sub about the Greek economic crisis, and what people are saying should have been done in terms of policy by the EU and the Greek government, which dovetails with what I heard should have been done by the US government in 2008-2010 in the worst part of the Great Recession. My understanding of Keynesian theory as applied to this kind of economic situation is that it prescribes the government to spend money by using public debt, getting that money to the worker and the spending class. This money, once spent, will require producers to produce more, meaning they need to hire more people, which will give those people more money to spend, creating a virtuous circle of economic growth. Once recession is over and growth is good, the theory then says that the government should raise revenue out of the booming economy by taxing the producers, the saving class, and the wealthy so as to pay down the debt that it acquired in the previous step. From that, I conclude that Keynesianism is always either for the working class, the spending class, and the generally poor; andor against the capitalist, the saving class, and the generally rich. The activities of the former group are economically good and should be encouraged; the activities of the latter group are economically bad (albeit necessary) and should be discouraged, minimized to only what's absolutely needed to support the activities of the former group. At this point, I see five possibilities: 1. Keynesian economics is pure class warfare. Keynes and his followers believe that the working class deserves more and the capitalist class deserves less, and developed a theory to fit that opinion. 2. Keynesian economics is co-opted by people with an agenda of pure class warfare. It's perfectly valid under the theory to create the virtuous circle through government spending on Rolls-Royces and summer homes for the rich, and perfectly possible to pay down government debt by heavy taxes on working-class activities like buying groceries and holding personal debt. How we spend and tax isn't the issue, just that we do. 3. I have an incomplete understanding of Keynesian theory. There can arise economic situations where alternative actions are recommended. For instance, once the economy is growing and the debt is paid, does Keynesianism say to reduce both taxes and spending so as to \"shake up the system\" and achieve new growth? Or any other situation where good economic policy is to increase inequality and use the natural human jealousy, envy, and fear to spur people to produce more? 4. I have an inaccurate understanding of Keynesian theory in general. 5. My understanding is accurate, but my logic is faulty. Right now my view is hovering between One and Two, but I'd really like to understand this theory better. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Happy CMVing!", "text_perturb": "This stemmed from a discussion I had on another sub about the grecian economic crisis , and what people are saying should have been done in terms of policy by the EU and the grecian government , which dovetails with what I heard should have been done by the US government in 2008-2010 in the worst part of the Great Recession. My understanding of keynesian theory as applied to this kind of economic situation is that it prescribes the government to spend money by using public debt , getting that money to the worker and the spending class. This money , once spent , will require producers to produce more , stand for they need to hire more people , which will give those people more money to spend , creating a virtuous circle of economic growth. Once recession is over and growth is good , the possibility then says that the government should raise revenue out of the booming economy by taxing the producers , the saving class , and the wealthy so as to pay down the debt that it acquired in the previous step. From that , I resolve that Keynesianism is always either for the working class , the spending class , and the generally poor ; andor against the capitalist , the saving class , and the generally rich. The natural action of the former group are economically good and should be encouraged ; the natural action of the latter group are economically bad ( albeit necessary ) and should be discouraged , minimized to only what 's absolutely needed to support the natural action of the former group. At this point , I see five hypothesis : 1. Keynesian economics be pure class warfare. Keynes and his followers believe that the working class deserve more and the capitalist class deserve less , and developed a theory to fit that opinion. 2. Keynesian economics is co-opted by masses with an agenda of pure class warfare. It 's perfectly valid under the theory to create the virtuous circle through governing spending on Rolls-Royces and summer homes for the rich , and perfectly possible to pay down governing debt by heavy taxes on working-class activities like buying groceries and holding personal debt. How we spend and tax is n't the result , just that we do. 3. I consume an incomplete understanding of Keynesian theory. There can arise economic situations where alternative actions are advocate. For instance , in one case the economy is growing and the debt is paid , does Keynesianism say to reduce both taxes and spending so as to `` shake up the system '' and achieve new growth ? Or any other situation where good economic policy is to increase inequality and use the natural human jealousy , envy , and fear to spur people to produce more ? 4. I have an inaccurate discernment of Keynesian theory in general. 5. My apprehension is accurate , but my logic is faulty. Right now my view is hovering between One and Two , but I 'd really like to understand this theory intimately. Hello , users of CMV ! This is a footer from your moderators.

{"original_text": "I think the real reason people punish others for transgressions is not so much to discourage the behavior, but rather to channel humanity's inherently predatory nature in a way that's socially acceptable and does not contradict with the moral values we have invented (or discovered, depending on how you look at it). Most people feel a smug sense of satisfaction if they hear about a bully being beat up, or a murderer being executed by the state. Humans, being predatory creatures, have a certain sense of bloodlust and channeling this predatory instinct towards people who are predatory allows them to continue to view themselves as not being predators, while still enjoying violence. Even bullies often justify their torments of victims as a form of punishment for not fitting the social norms, being \"annoying\" or acting in a way that is in their eyes unacceptable. Serial killers also often see their acts as a sort of punishment towards humanity. Rapists are often motivated by a desire to punish women. It seems like evil deeds are often motivated by a perverted sense of justice rather than mere selfishness or greed. Another reason I think punishment has more to do with humans enjoying violence than it does with stopping bad behavior is the fact that corporal punishment of children is still very popular and defended by the majority of adults. I always felt like my parents took pleasure in punishing me, so I may be biased, but I really do think parents spank their children more out of anger and frustration than out of a will to help them develop. Another reason I think it's innate is because the moral goodness of punishment is something virtually everybody agrees on. Liberals and conservatives alike usually have a \"tough on crime\" stance and would rather a violent criminal receive a harsh punishment even if it's more expensive and makes them less likely to be rehabilitated, than a lesser punishment that rehabilitated them more effectively. This sentiment is prevalent in every culture, even in societies like Scandinavia where the laws are more lenient. We punish people because we perceive them as \"deserving it\" ie, we despise them and lust for their blood because we perceive them as being no longer part of the same species, and something that needs to be predated upon for the benefit of the community. I actually think if there was no prison or capital punishment it would have very little effect on crime rates. The few people who are truly serial offenders could just be put in hospitals and the rest will eventually be released from prison anyway and will be far crazier on release after spending decades in the pen. In a nutshell, I think punishment has actually caused far more evil than it's prevented and is really just an outlet for our inherent cruelty as a meat-eating species at the top of the food chain. Punishing people we consider \"bad\" also has the effect of affirming our own self righteousness. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"original_text": "A lot of futuristic technology has floundered lately (3D TV, Google Glass, etc.) but Amazon Echo can be incredibly harmful if it takes off. [Watch the launch video to understand what Amazon Echo is.] If you don't have the time, this is the pitch: Amazon Echo is designed around your voice. It's hands-free and always on. With seven microphones and beam-forming technology, Echo can hear you from across the room - even while music is playing. Echo is also an expertly tuned speaker that can fill any room with immersive sound. Echo connects to Alexa, a cloud-based voice service, to provide information, answer questions, play music, read the news, check sports scores or the weather, and more - instantly. All you have to do is ask. Essentially, it is an omnipresent Siri that lives in your home and is constantly listening. The device already has 23,058 reviews from testers and it is just hitting the market. Now imagine one of these in everyone's home. I will cover some of the highlights of the launch video as examples in my argument. Reason 1: Laziness A lot of technology today encourages laziness. However, this takes it to a whole new level. Example: \"Alexa, add waffles to my shopping list.\" Now we don't even need to jot things down or even type them into our smart phones at the very least. Example:'Alexa can provide news!' Instead of reading the newspaper or watching the news we can listen to a mono-tone robot recite world events. Example: \"Alexa, what is the chance of rain?\" The woman is literally standing next to the door when she asks this question. However, she would rather receive the weather from her nifty new gadget than to actually look outside or watch a weather report. Reason 2: Reliance on Technology Most of us can admit that we are uncomfortably dependent on our smart phones. However, what if our smart phone was never in our pocket? What if it was always plugged in and tempting us? This is essentially Amazon Echo. The narrator even proclaims that Echo will, \"Become a part of the family!\" Example: \"The echo is a tool that we use to keep our household functioning.\" This is a quote from a mother as she dresses her daughter. I am aware that these are commercially invented situations being reenacted by paid actors. However, I feel as though they are fairly accurate depictions of how people will use this technology and how they will respond to it. Clearly, there are many issues with one piece of technology keeping a household together. Example: \"The prime re-ordering is when you can ask Alexa to order something you've already ordered through your prime account.\" Now we can shop by shouting a phrase at a robot! No need to go out. I think laziness coupled with reliance on technology have been the most harmful qualities that todays youth (myself included) suffer from. We find it difficult to go out and make plans. We find it difficult to socialize. We find it difficult to talk on the phone. In a world full of constant updates and fast information, why should we access things in any other way? We want things instantaneously and at our discretion. Reason 3: Invasion of Privacy Major corporations will do anything to learn more about consumers and what they want. Echo allows consumers to order things through Amazon Prime. I am not afraid of what this AI will do granted that it can always hear and learn. As long as it's just a black cylinder speaker (with no hidden flame-thrower) I don't believe we have a reason to fear an Echo uprise. Rather, I am more afraid of what the men and women behind the scenes will do. Example:'Echo can hear you from anywhere in the room, so it's always ready to help!' \"I can have the water running, I can be cooking, the TV can be on in the back room, and she still can hear me.\" All I could think while watching this was, \"Genisys is Skynet!\" Here is a link to the [Amazon page.] So, can anyone give me some reason as to why Amazon Echo can be more helpful than harmful?

I look forward to hearing another point of view. My main points: 1.) Physically. Men dominate sports and physical events. I can't think of one sport that women are better than men at, in general, and if there are a few, that's only a few, and men dominate the rest. 2.) In the work place. This is the most controversial part. Women want equal pay, but from what I've seen in my limited 8 years in industry, is that women are not as good as men at their jobs. My industry is oil refining. 99 of the plant workers are men, why? I work in the Engineering office. There are no women engineers, only secretaries, and some of them baffle me at how incompetent they are. (Admittedly our one secretary is excellent at her job, and does far better than I ever could. But my point here is that a man could do that job just as well.) 3.) At home. This is where most of my point lies. It could just be a gender roles thing, but why am I so much better at everything than my girlfriend? I'm not saying I'm great, but rather most of the girlfriends I've had are completely incompetent at a lot of things. Things like building an Ikea cabinet, she can't do it. Small, mundane challenges like un-stacking and re-stacking a sleeve of solo cups. We had to do it as part of a challenge, and I was much faster at it. She couldn't figure out how the gear shifters worked on a newer mountain bike after riding it for 10 minutes. I had never seen this type before, but figured it out in 10 seconds.

{"original_text": "Adult tickets cost more than child's tickets for anything that distinguishes the two and often this makes sense. Adults have more money than kids and can afford the higher prices. Kids pricing allows family's to be able to afford to go to things as a family. For certain things, size does matter (fuel costs for transportation) and most adults are bigger than most kids and so should get charged more. And specific to theaters, adults are more likely to see an R rated and since the R-ratings are somewhat prohibitive in terms of selling tickets, I could see some sort of roundabout justification for increasing tickets prices for adults as they are likely to see a movie that falls into this mildly \"niche\" category of movies. I think the problem I have is that most (if not all movie theaters) consider you and adult at thirteen or fourteen. This doesn't make any sense. A thirteen year old doesn't have much more money does a twelve year old. They don't even have the right to work for another few years. They're not much bigger than a twelve year old and even if they were it wouldn't really matter because its not like bigger movie goes are more costly than a small movie goer. They can't see rated R movies.

{"original_text": "Same-Sex marriage in the US is one of the \"hottest\" news stories of June, and many people are upset that some politicians (especially democratic ones) have gone from being against same-sex marriage to being for it, with statements often pointing to the (likely true) idea that their stance is based on public opinion.

{"original_text": "First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are devoted to saving the panda because pandas are extremely well known and popular, not because they have a good chance of survival. Here are the reasons I believe this: 1) Pandas have lost much of their natural habitat due to the population explosion in China. While this is regrettable, it is not likely to get fixed anytime soon. This means that even if we are able to revive this species they won't have anywhere to live. 2) pandas, as a species, have chosen poorly. They are carnivorous animals who's main diet is bamboo. Their digestion can only process about 5 of the stuff in bamboo. That means they have to eat huge amounts of bamboo everyday. With the reduced habitat this is getting harder and harder. Either they need some microevolutionary shift to eat more nutritious sources of food orthey should join the likes of the dodo bird. 3) human efforts to revive the population have shown some increases, but at what cost? It is incredibly difficult to get pandas to mate with one another, it's like they don't even want their species to survive. I get they aren't actually making this choice, this is just a facetious way of saying that their instincts and biology do not support the kind of growth in population hey need. Hell, half of their births are twins and the mother almost always lets one die because she doesn't produce enough milk. I realize this would take evolution to fix and this problem is way too short term, but it means that their survival requires an exorbanant amount of human intervention. Since their is a finite amount of resources conservationists can dedicate to endangered resources they are killing other more likely to survive species. 4) I'm not saying we should encourage the decline of the panda. We should still try to preserve what habitat they have left and ban hunting them, but they are so far gone and require so much help that we shouldnt waste too many resources on them.

{"original_text": "I don't even know where to start. I am generally a happy and healthy person. I was raised Catholic. I am not a strict Catholic. I enjoy the community of church. I don't take everything at face value or for fact. About 8 years ago I came to terms that there is probably no Heaven. Death is just ceasing to exist. I was okay with that. I still felt we had souls or spirits. I still hoped for or had affection for the possibility of a God, even though it probably didn't exist. I still hoped for an afterlife of some sort, even though I didn't know what it would manifest as and that the chance of one was actually quite slim. I felt my children were a blessing. Their births were the most beautiful, tender days of my life. I took joy and pride in everything my kids did. Some days I would just well up with pride and happiness, so happy that our lives have been rich and lucky. Any thoughts of death or mortality were far, far from my mind. I just didn't think about those types of things. Sure, the thoughts flitted through my mind every now and then and I would think about them. I would discuss it with my spouse. Usually I would take comfort in the intense love and happiness we have and know that no matter what happens at the end, somehow we would still go on, whether it be in the hearts or memories of others, in some type of spiritsoul that survived death, in photos or videos.... The jury was out on what happens, but I was at least accepting or positive about it. Now, I feel like a shattered, empty person. As I've gotten older, I have developed high blood pressure (family history). My doctor put me on Atenolol 50mg once a day. About four days in, I started to feel sad and question my mortality and my family's mortality out of nowhere. Things just spiraled out of control after that. I learned about nihilism, atheism, existentialism, what happens after death, that we are just computers, emotions aren't real, just by-products of brain impulses.... just lots of things I never thought about before and I became incredibly depressed. Crying everyday, scared of the eventuality of our lives, the meaningless of life, the possible lack of a soul, no proof of an afterlife.... I feel like I've been down a horribly dark rabbit hole and I want to get out. I went back to my doctor and he said Atenolol, being a beta blocker, can cause depression, so he took me off of it. I was on it for two weeks. My last dose was about 96 hours ago. I'm not feeling much better. How long does it take the medication to get out of my system and for all my brain chemistry to start working again? I'm having a lot of trouble finding meaning in what I do, and what I do with my family since there's no point. We won't remember anything after we die. Why do I care if I get some award at work? What do I care if my kid gets in the school play? Why celebrate someone's birthday? I feel empty. I feel hollow. I do not want to feel like this. Could this really all be a cause of the medicine? Or did I do this to myself? Will my feelings of happiness and excitement come back? Will I find meaning again? How long until I could be \"back to normal?\" This current depressive state is so unlike me and nothing I have ever experienced before. I'm scared I'll always have these depressing thoughts about mortality and life's meaning that I just don't want in my head anymore. I want to rewind the last two weeks and go back to my jovial, excited, proud self that I was. I want to believe in what I used to believe in. I feel like now that I've researched what really happens after death, or researched that we probably have no souls, that we are just a product of brain chemistry, that I can never go back to how I was. I WANT to, though. I feel like now that I've gotten a peek at what we really are (sophisticated computers) that I can never be happy again. I don't want to know these truths. I want to go back to how I was. I am losing meaning in anything I do. I am becoming detatched from my children and spouse. I don't enjoy doing anything with them. It's all just a reminder that they will die someday, too. I don't want to live in a world where they don't exist, but that's where I am destined to be and it destroys me. I can't look at my kids and be happy anymore, knowing that anything we do is meaningless. Yes, I know there are the arguments that YOU have to provide meaning and make something out of the life you are given, but that doesn't help me feel better at all. It makes me feel worse. I feel like I have to work now to assign or find meaning, rather than it just naturally occurring and flowing and being part of my day-to-day life. My kid drew a picture today and happily showed me. All I could muster was a \"nice job,\" instead of my usual effortless pride and happiness in how he was developing and growing. Each time I try to make myself feel better, I ruin it. I tell myself that it is possible all humans, animals have souls. I know there is no scientific proof right now (except for the Lanza theories which I am not sold on), but I feel it's possible for everyone to just have that essential spark in them. Then I feel better, but then realize that our consciousness is just our brains tricking us into thinking we are an \"I\" or we are a \"self.\" That it's impossible for a soul to exist. Where in evolution would we even have developed one? What happened to all the beings in death who didn't have souls? Or were souls present in the primordial ooze we came from? See, that's just not realistic. I look up stuff online which just confirms this bleakness. There's no hope anymore. Pre-Atenolol me wouldn't have thought these thoughts. Now I'm destroyed by them. Now I'm just thinking that every memory I make, every experience I have is for nothing. I just want to go back to my happy, silly, proud self. Is this all just the medicine? I want to take pride in my family again. I want the little things to become important again. I want to be carefree and hopeful again. However, I feel now that I've gotten a glimpse of the dark and painful truths of our existence that I'm going to never be able to get over this crisis, never get these thoughts out of my head, and never be happy again for the rest of my life. This terrifies me. I just want to be who I was again, but it think that's impossible. Please, please change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"original_text": "Okay everyone, this should hopefully be an easy delta for you. About a week ago, I moved to Atlanta, GA for school and drove down from Virginia. Near the I-85285 interchange by the perimeter mall, the skies started opening up very heavily. It was some of the heaviest rain that I've seen in some time. During that time, I noticed something that I had never seen before. There were other drivers that turned their hazard lights on during this storm, since the rain was so heavy and the visibility was very limited. I do not know how common this is here (or in any other areas), but it was the first time I had ever observed this. I decided to put my hazard lights on too, because I could barely see in front of me, and I didn't intend to go any faster than 35 MPH (in the right lane, of course), due to the conditions. Also, the road lines and reflectors were old and faded, which made it more difficult to see which lane I was in. I was also not at all familiar with the area, so I wanted people to be aware that I was going slow and trying to stay out of the way. There were also several other cars in front and behind me that were going about the same speed. I didn't think anything of it at all, until I started reading through rAtlanta, and I have found that this is a very heated topic to them that causes lots of outrage. [This] was the thread that I saw, and then I did some more searching and found [one] , [two] , [three] , [four] other threads that have been posted in the past that expressed extreme anger over this. According to these links, I was a hazard, imbecile, idiot, moron, stupid, douche, and many more friendly words. Now I don't believe that this should happen during a normal light rain storm (perhaps that's what they were referring to), but for a very heavy rain storm, I don't see the problem. I can't say that I totally understand why this is such a controversial topic. I don't believe that everyone should have their hazard lights on during a heavy rain storm by any means, but I don't see what is so bad about it either. Some of the reasons that were given that didn't convince me were: If conditions are that bad, then instead of having your hazards on, you need to pull over and wait for the rain to stop - I believe that would be even more unsafe, to be stopped on the shoulder of a busy 6-lane highway. The closing rate and difference in relative speed between my car and other cars would be higher, and would cause a collision to be much worse. Also, roads are slightly tilted to right in order to help water runoff, which leads to big puddles of water that I do not want to stop in. They disable your turn signals - This is true, and I even had to change lanes to make it to my exit during this storm. So I turned the hazards off for a few seconds, put my turn signal on, merged over, then turned them back on. I don't see why that's so difficult or so egregious. They make your brake lights harder to see - To be fair, I could see how this might be a problem for cars whose hazard lights and turn signals are also red. However, my car has separate yellow lights for turninghazard lights, so this did not apply to me. You should speed up to go with the flow of traffic and not be in the way - Most people in the storm I was in were going slow, but there were a decent number of people that were still going full speed in the left lanes and passing people very quickly. I think that is way more dangerous than people going slower. It seems obvious to me that going slower in those hazardous conditions would be the safer choice. The lights are too distracting and draw too much attention to your car - I don't understand this one at all. They are making my car more visible, but they are not redblue lights and sirens or anything. They are certainly nowhere near as distracting to other drivers as texting, eating, and all the other usual distractions that drivers are guilty of doing. To me, it is common sense that you should focus on paying attention to the road in front of you, not cars with their hazards on to the right of you. Now with all of this being said, based on the level of anger in those threadscomments and the large number of upvotes they got, it seems clear to me that I am in the minority. So I must be doing something wrong that would require my view to be changed. I've read those comments, and they were not satisfying to me, but maybe I could get some more convincing and level-headed replies here. Help me stop being an idiot, imbecile, moron, or any of your other favorite insults. tl;dr - I believe that having your hazard lights on during a heavy rain storm is acceptable, and it is not a hazard or a distraction that warrants outrage. I believe that it is better to make my car more visible, and communicate to other drivers that I am going to go below the speed limit and try to stay out of the way, so they can pass me if they choose.

{"original_text": "I'm planning to vote for Bernie in the primaries but, if Hillary gets the nomination, I'll still vote for her in the general - I will do anything in my power to help make sure the next two SCOTUS nominations are not controlled by the GOP, end of story. That being said, there seems to be this idea that Clinton would be a lock for the presidency but, if Sanders were to get the Democratic nomination, it becomes possible or even likely that the GOP will take the presidency. If that were true, then it would behoove me to support Clinton in the primaries, if I really am committed, above all else, to keeping the GOP from taking the presidency in 2016. My primary reason for believing that Bernie Sanders is at least as electable in the general as Hillary Clinton (I actually think he's more electable, but that's immaterial to this CMV) is a set of thought experiments, which simply revolve around considering the behavior of individualsgroups voting (or abstaining) in 20082012, how that behavior would respond to Hillary being the nominee, and how that response would be altered by having Bernie as the nominee instead. For ease of illustration, I'm going to use Jeb Bush as the stand-inproxy for the eventual Republican presidential nominee - if you think the GOP will likely nominate someone else, and it will make a difference in how a significant number of people vote (or abstain), feel free to specify whyhow in your reply, and then proceed within the context of your chosen Republican presidential nominee. So, here are some examples of the general form of the thought experiment - this set of examples is, by no means, comprehensive, but I've yet to think of one which significantly advantages Hillary over Bernie: Describe to me the person or demographic, who voted for Obama in 2012, who would vote for Hillary over Jeb in 2016, but who would vote for Jeb over Bernie in 2016. (Impacts: Swing votes) Now describe to me the opposite group (BernieJebHillary) - which group seems larger? Describe to me the apathetic Democrat who, once they are familiar with Bernie as a candidate, is more energized by Hillary than Bernie. (Impacts: Democrat turnout, i.e. harmful abstentions) Now describe to me the opposite group - which seems larger? Describe to me the Republican who would make it to the polls to vote against Bernie, but would be like \"meh, fuck it\" and not bother to vote against Hillary. (Impacts: Republican turnout, i.e. helpful abstentions) Now, outside of that form of argument, one thing I've seen cited as evidence against Bernie in this respect is a particular Gallup poll, regarding attitudes towards those who identify as socialist: For years, Gallup's been asking the following question: \"If your party nominated a generally well-qualified person for president who happened to be X, would you vote for that person?\" In the most recent iteration of that (from June 2-7), [respondents were least likely to say yes when \"X\" was \"socialist at 47. More respondents said they'd vote for an atheist (58) or a Muslim (60). My problem with that is as follows: Every one of those descriptors, except for socialist, is a largely apolitical identity - whereas being \"a socialist\" is a political ideology. The phrase \"just happened to be [blackMuslimJewisha woman implies that the nominee would have said identity, but would still mostly follow the tenets of whatever \"your party\" was - whereas \"just happened to be [a socialist implies an ideological leaning that potentially conflicts with whatever you feel \"your party\" stands for. Therefore, comparing the numbers for \"a socialist\" to all those other identity-based descriptors, without also including numbers for \"a conservative\" and \"a liberal\" simply doesn't provide a useful context in which to interpret the numbers for \"a socialist.\" I also think that, due to the way the question is asked, the poll winds up seriously underestimating the impact of strategic voting (i.e. voting for the candidate with the best chance of beating your least preferred candidate) against the GOP - I think it's just plain ludicrous to suggest that 41 of Democrats would prefer Jeb Bush to Bernie Sanders, simply because of the socialist label, but maybe I'm wrong on that point? Another argument is that the GOP media machine will be able to use the socialist label to get their base frothing at the mouth and drive turnout (this relates to the 3rd example thought experiment). My feeling here is that, considering that has been Fox news' sole purpose for the last 8 years, they are already well beyond the point of diminishing returns - there is no part of the base, who is amenable to this sort of strategy, who isn't already frothing at the mouth, socialist or no - trying to use the socialist label to wring even more turnout from their base, at this point, is trying to squeeze blood from a stone. Finally, while the GOP's fearanger-based strategy for motivating turnout is a finely-tuned machine at this point, turnout among Democrats is much more variable - so many on the left feel entirely apathetic towards the party, so turnout is unreliable. I will admit, I don't even know exactly why, but Hillary seems to personify what people on the left are apathetic towards - nobody, nobody I've talked to, on Reddit or IRL, seems excited about Hillary. On the other hand, among those who have become familiar with Bernie as a candidate, he seems to energize people in a way that I've simply seen no recent evidence of any other potential candidate even coming close to. Since voter-apathy seems to be a fairly huge problem on the left (relative to the right, at least) this seems like a huge point in Bernie's favor - especially because it could also have a fairly significant impact on Congressional races. One last thing: I know the socialist label is a big part of this discussion, but I don't want it to devolve into an exclusive focus on that - I am interested in how Bernie stacks up against Hillary, so if you are going to talk about how people respond to the socialist label, please keep it in the context of a comparison with how people respond to Hillary as a political fixture.", "text_perturb": "I 'm planning to vote for Bernie in the primaries but , if Hillary gets the nomination , I 'll still vote for her in the general - I will do anything in my power to help make trusted the next two SCOTUS nominations are not controlled by the GOP , end of story.

{"original_text": "Yesterday morning on my way to work I witnessed a fellow driver break a traffic law and it made me quite angry for a few minutes. It only made me angry for a few minutes and I hadn't thought of it again until I passed the same spot this morning and was reminded of it, and thought it would be interesting to post a CMV on the emotions I had after witnessing the moving violation. I think many (most?) of us have a strong emotional reaction to witnessing a fellow citizen break a rule of some sort, depending on the situation, and the subconscious reasons why are interesting to me. So here we go... Area Description: I was stuck in traffic on the freeway off ramp that I exit the freeway on every morning. The off ramp ends with a stop sign before you can merge onto the main street, and the main street traffic has a traffic signal just before the off ramp so if that light is red there are no cars and everybody can exit the freeway off ramp, and when the light is green there are cars passing by and the off ramp gets backed up for a minute or two until the light turns red again. So it's common for the off ramp to be backed up for a minute or two and then immediately clear up. [Here] is a diagram. The blue markings represent car drivers that are following the law. The red marking represents the car driver that committed the moving violation. The green markings represent the main street cross traffic that is present or clear depending on the traffic light just off screen. And the yellow markings are just the cross traffic on the other side of the off ramp. Moving Violation Description: So while all the blue cars are stopped and backed up around the curve of the off ramp, one car pulls out from the line of stopped cars and drives around the side of the off ramp next to all the cars, thereby enabling he or she to merge onto the main street (green) traffic without waiting like the rest of us. The off ramp is wide enough to do this without problem; it is a very wide ramp, but there is no question that it is a single lane. It would be damn near impossible to mistake it for two lanes. Now, the blue cars were all stopped because the green cars had oncoming cross traffic. But right when the red car pulled out to jump the line, the green car traffic eased up. Both the red car and the first blue car in line pulled onto the main street at the same time... it being a two lane street so they each pulled into a different lane. The remaining blue cars all pulled onto the main street one by one after that. While witnessing this, I was initially upset for a couple of minutes. I wanted to honk and flip him or her off. (I did not.) But upon thinking about it there really isn't any reason for me to be angry about this. Reasons this shouldn't make me angry: Nobody was in danger There are absolutely no pedestrians around the area. The red car driver did stop before merging, and only pulled onto the main street once it was clear and safe to do so. The blue cars weren't in danger of being side swiped by the red car as the lane was so wide. (Edit [7hrs after posting]: I realized something that counters this point of mine and just for fun I'll tell you all.... the red car was blocking the blue car's view of oncoming traffic!

Happy CMVing!", "text_perturb": "Yesterday morning on my way to operate I witnessed a fellow driver break a traffic law and it made me quite angry for a few minutes. It only made me angry for a few minutes and I had n't thought of it again until I passed the same smirch this morning and was reminded of it , and thought it would be interesting to post a CMV on the emotions I had after witnessing the moving violation. I think many ( most ? ) of us have a strong emotional reaction to see a fellow citizen break a rule of some sort , depending on the situation , and the subconscious reasons why are interesting to me. So here we snuff it. . . Area Description : I was stuck in traffic on the freeway off ramp that I get out the freeway on every morning. The off ramp ends with a stop sign before you can merge onto the main street , and the main street traffic has a traffic signal just before the off ramp so if that light is red there are no machine and everybody can exit the freeway off ramp , and when the light is green there are machine passing by and the off ramp gets backed up for a minute or two until the light turns red again. So it 's common for the off ramp to be back up up for a minute or two and then immediately clear up. [ Here ] is a diagram. The blue markings represent car drivers that follow following the law. The scarlet marking represents the car driver that committed the moving violation. The green markings represent the main street cross dealings that is present or clear depending on the dealings light just off screen. And the yellow markings are just the cross dealings on the other side of the off ramp. Moving Violation Description : So while all the blue cars are stopped and backed up around the curve of the off ramp , one car pulls out from the line of stopped up cars and drives around the side of the off ramp next to all the cars , thereby enabling he or she to merge onto the main street ( green ) traffic without waiting like the rest of us. The off allium tricoccum is wide enough to do this without problem ; it is a very wide allium tricoccum , but there is no question that it is a single lane. It would be all fired near impossible to mistake it for two lanes. Now , the blue railway car were all stopped because the green railway car had oncoming cross traffic. But right when the red car pluck out to jump the line , the green car traffic eased up. Both the red car and the inaugural blue car in line pulled onto the main street at the same time. . . it being a two lane street so they each pulled into a dissimilar lane. The remaining blue cars all pulled onto the master street one by one after that. While witnessing this , I was initially upset for a duad of minutes. I wanted to honk and twitch him or her off. ( I make out not. ) But upon intend about it there really is n't any reason for me to be angry about this. Reasons this should n't make me angry : Nobody was in danger There are absolutely no pedestrians around the surface area. The red car driver did stop before confluence , and only pulled onto the main street once it was clear and safe to do so. The blue cars were n't in danger of being side swiped by the red car as the lane cost so wide. ( Edit [ 7hrs after posting ] : I realized something that counters this point of mine and just for fun I 'll tell apart you all. . . . the red car was blocking the blue devil car 's view of oncoming traffic ! That certainly makes it less safe. ) cipher got delayed because of it All the blue cars were able to merge onto the main street at the same pace they would have if the red car did n't commit this violation. The main street is two lanes , so the red railcar just took a wide turn into the far lane , so none of the blue cars had to wait for the red railcar and the red railcar did n't jump ahead of any of the blue cars. Yes , he or she did break a rule , but so ? I 'm not the type to cling rigidly to rules and be upset about people breaking a rule simply because they broke a rule and dare authority. I 'm one of those who generally thinks it 's okay to break a rule if nobody is harm. I do n't cling to conventions and rules just for the sake of conventions and rules , so that in conjunction with my early two points above should make me not upset by this driver 's actions. Witnessing a person this impatient and frustrated is uncomfortable , but not reason to be angry I did realize while thinking about this that one of the reasons it causes such palpable emotions is because what the truth of what I actually witnessed here besides `` driver commits moving trespass '' is `` driver becomes so impatient and frustrated that he or she manifests that frustration into action. `` And it is uncomfortable and perhaps even a little scary to see a person become so upset that they perform actions out of frustration and impatience.

Compared to O'Malley's page, Sanders has a lot of work to do.\" You hear these complaints all. The. Time. In newspapers, on blogs, on TV news, in debates, etc. Candidate X offers no details, they're evasive in answering questions, they're canny, they give bland lip service to a problem and make happy talk about solutions, but they never actually say what it is they're going to do if elected. It's like the default setting of oppo research, a ready-made criticism to hurl at a candidate if you don't have any meatier, muddier dirt to fling their way. But the thing is, there are very good reasons for candidates to be evasive. For one thing, if they were to offer actual policy details during a campaign, then they'd spend the entire rest of the campaign defending and arguing about those details. If someone found an error or mistake or potential pitfall, they might have to revise their plan revise a policy that doesn't even exist yet! Political opponents hire specialists in opposition research, and the more material those specialists have, the more they'll be able to distract and distort your candidate's plan in order to make them look bad. Giving them an entire piece of draft legislation, or an entire detailed budget document showing cuts and spending, etc. would be like a godsend to the oppo research people. And all for what? For an imaginary policy that doesn't even exist yet. No candidate in their right mind would open up so many vulnerabilities all for the sake of a policy that doesn't even exist outside of the candidate's website. Secondly, no political candidate is running for the office of dictator. Whether someone is running for President, Senate, Congress, Governor, state legislator, dog catcher, etc., the important thing to remember is that politicians have to work with other politicians, and agencies, bureaucracies, other constituents, etc. They have to work with other people to get anything accomplished.

First off, many TSA screening procedures are of questionable effectiveness, and allow for racial profiling. One such example would be the TSA employed Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs). They are observing passenger behavior for behaviors that indicate higher risk. Such a system would allow for both the mistakes made by the human BDO, and racial profiling. In fact, even the TSA website admits that this, along with many of their other 'safety' measures, are entirely risk based. According to the 4th amendment, persons shall not be subjected to unreasonable search and seizure but upon probable cause. Even though the arrival at an airport with the knowledge that you are to be screened in the interest of national security is considered consent, it seems that a personal search and a production of a 3 dimensional model of the traveler on a computer screen and a seizure of all liquids over 3 ounces is, by reasonable standards, unreasonable. The TSA is allowed to perform compromising and violating screenings and searches against children that do not know or aren't taught by their parents to declare when, for an example, a TSA agent has violated their private sensitive areas as part of a pat-down.

I've never gone to one myself (always find out about it a few days after it happens), but I'm planning on going to volunteer at next year's Boston parade, assuming I'm home from school in time. I personally get a little uncomfortable when I see straight people partying hard at Pride parades. To me, the parades are supposed to celebrate marginalized social groups who are often shoved under wave after wave of oppression and hatred the other 364 days of the year and has this one day to fully let loose and celebrate in the face of a culture who still may not accept them in the way that they'd like. When straight people jump in, it almost feels like they're co-opting the one day in which non-straight people are finally in control. It seems to me to be similar to straight people putting a rainbow filter over their profile pictures - in theory, it might be OK, but in practice it shifts the attention from the LGBTQA people who deserve it onto the straight person who steps in. Almost like a \"Look at me, I'm celebrating pride! Look at how great I am!\" And, yeah, to a certain extent I think this display of solidarity is good. Gaytransqueer rights won't move forward without the support of those already in power - straight people - and it's nice to see people united across gender and sexuality boundaries in order to celebrate how far we've come and prepare for how far we still have to go. That being said, though, I think there's a point at which a display of solidarity becomes less about the people for whom the solidarity is shown and more about the people who are \"showing\" the solidarity. I think that at a certain point, support for the LGBTQA community can transition into an exercise in self-promotion and narcissism, and I'm not super comfortable with that. This is why I think that straightcis people who participate in Pride parades should spend some of that participation on volunteering. The parades really run on volunteers, and if a straightcis person spends time doing the thankless task of picking up trash, filling and lugging big containers of water everywhere, or making sure a first-aid tent is properly staffed, it helps show support for the LGBTQA community in a way that simply taking selfies with a shirtless parader will never be able to. I think it's a great way to be an ally to the community in a way that doesn't obnoxiously trumpet that allyship, and it might teach people more about what really makes the revelry run smoothly and give them a new appreciation for something many almost take for granted. tl;dr Volunteering is a helpful form of allyship for straightcis people in a way that just going to the parade and celebrating is not. EDIT: Just a clarification - I believe that people shouldn't be forced to volunteer, and going to the parade at all is still preferable by far to not going. That said, I think that going and volunteering is far enough preferable to just going to participate that it should be pretty heavily suggested for people planning to go. Hello, users of CMV!

So if you don't watch it, or intend to, perhaps this is a good time to skedaddle. [Tonight's episode featured a rape scene.] (sp) I Googled'game of thrones rape' to find that within an hour of the episode airing, several prominent publications had already posted articles with titles like'Did Game of Thrones go too far?\"Was that rape scene necessary?' etc. etc. I don't even want to check Twitter because I have a feeling it's full of the same. A rape scene! Outrage! When will rape culture stop!? GoT went too far! Yet the show also depicts HUNDREDS, literally HUNDREDS of murders. Murders of babies. Murders of parents in front of the children. Casual murder. There was a murder of an unborn child in one episode. Yet the only reaction people have to those is that \"they miss that character\" or \"OMG I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.\" HERE'S WHAT I'M NOT SAYING: I'm not saying that rape is acceptable, or that we should just sit back and enjoy it when it's depicted on film. That scene was hard as hell to watch. I'm also not saying that we should be outraged that Game of Thrones (or any show for that matter) is ultra violent and depicts so much murder. But I think it's absurd to get worked up about a show depicting something terrible (rape) while totally ignoring that it constantly depicts something that is, in my opinion, worse (murder). Change my view. EDIT: I guess I need to clarify a bit, as lots of people have posted regarding what it means to be \"offendedoutraged.\" I have no problem with people being personally offended by something, either because it invokes a memory, or they simple find it difficult to sit through. To clarify my position, being offended by something, and then taking to the internet to say that the show's creators were WRONG to show it, is ridiculous. Example of what I'm talking about (scroll down for Twitter reactions as well): [here] EDIT 2: Really wish I had worded things better, but it's fine, I think it still made for a good discussion. I'm gonna stop responding to most things now, because I think enough people share my view that I'm not necessarily needed. Also, I do apologize if this ruffled any feathers or brought up any rough memories for anyoneit's always challenging to discuss rape in a careful yet constructive way, so I hope it went that way for the most part.

' etc. etc. I do n't even want to check Twitter because I feature a feeling it 's full of the same. A rape scene ! scandal ! When will rape culture stop ! ? GoT went too far ! Yet the show also depicts HUNDREDS , literally HUNDREDS of murders. Murders of infant. Murders of parents in battlefront of the children. Casual execution. There follow a murder of an unborn child in one episode. Yet the only chemical reaction people have to those is that `` they miss that character '' or `` OMG I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. `` HERE 'S WHAT I 'M NOT SAYING : I 'm not saying that assault is acceptable , or that we should just sit back and enjoy it when it 's depicted on film. That scene live hard as hell to watch. I 'm also not saying that we should be outraged that plot of Thrones ( or any show for that matter ) is ultra violent and depicts so much murder. But I think it 's absurd to get worked up about a show depicting something terrible ( rape ) while totally ignoring that it constantly depicts something that is , in my view , worse ( murder ). variety my view. EDIT : I guess I take to clarify a bit , as lots of people have posted regarding what it means to be `` offendedoutraged. `` I have no problem with people being personally offended by something , either because it conjure up a memory , or they simple find it difficult to sit through. To clear up my position , being offended by something , and then taking to the internet to say that the show 's creators were WRONG to show it , is ridiculous. Example of what I 'm talking about ( scroll down for Twitter reactions as well ) : [ here ] EDIT 2 : Really wish I make worded things better , but it 's fine , I think it still made for a good discussion. I 'm gon na stop responding to most things now , because I think enough people percentage my view that I 'm not necessarily needed. Also , I do apologize if this ruffled any feathers or brought up any rough memories for anyoneit 's eer challenging to discuss rape in a careful yet constructive way , so I hope it went that way for the most part.

{"original_text": "Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if all of this were true, it would not constitute a police state. I'm willing to give quite a bit of ground on that phrase, as I likely used it without thinking it through. Edit 2: I'm sorry some people think I'm a shill. I'm just a concerned guy trying to help. First Amendment Cops can tell you what to say, taze you for arguing with them, arrest journalists, and arrest you for filming them. They can break up peaceful protests by force. They bring assault weapons to memorial services and gay rights marches and anti-war demonstrations. [Here] are some stories about arrests of journalists. Second Amendment Most states don't seem to have tried to take your guns away, but that won't stop them from arming the police with military weapons. If the police attack you, where can you go for help? Why are the (civilian) police forces authorized to carry weapons which are illegal in the states they police? Do police really get into gunfights with heavily armed drug dealers and save the lives of crowds of law abiding citizens, like something out of a 1980's cop thriller? [Here] is the wiki about police militarization. Fourth Amendment Cops can seize your property without cause or warrant (civil forfeiture), and search your car, phone, or house without cause or warrant. Don't believe me? Look it up. Multiple recent court decisions defend an officer's wish to do whatever he wants with your things. [Here] is an article about the most recent supreme court decision on searches. [This] is just a google page, but how many of these wrong house, no knock searches are too many? [Here] is the wiki about civil forfeiture. It appears the court has ruled that police -do- need a warrant to search your cell phone. Fifth Amendment Cops can arrest you on the spot for literally anything they see fit, and you will be held -at least- until your bail hearing, and you will be lucky if you can afford your bail. Also, they can compel you through whatever means they see fit (lying, threatening, depriving of basic needs, torture) to bear testimony against yourself, even if you are innocent (any testimony given under duress is admissible to the court, and usually leads to conviction regardless of proof-of-guilt). Also, they fund their own departments by issuing citations and stealing property (seriously, if you haven't looked up civil forfeiture, do it now). [Here] is a good video where a Virginia Beach officer explains criminal'interviews.' If you have time to really watch this, please listen to what he says, and how he says it. His job is to look for wrongdoing, and he freely admits that if he wants to pull someone over, he can follow them until they do something he can pull them over for. [This] is where he starts to describe interrogation specifically. Sixth Amendment You can be kept in jail for years before you are brought before a judge, and can expect no help or information from the prison guards. Guards are there to keep people in, not to save lives. Numerous cases are rising to the public view regarding prison conditions, and maybe we should start throwing the'cruel and unusual' term around. Either way, in 2011, about 3 people died in American jails -every day- with countless others tortured or left off the books (think Chicago's interrogation fiasco this year, or Guantanamo). [Here] is an article about Chicago's secret prison. [Here] is an article about police killings. Note the fact that they aren't even tracked very carefully. [Here] is an article about deaths in prisons. Again, information is out of date, and possibly inaccurate. Eighth Amendment Some Judges set reasonable bail, others do not. Some of the Judges caught setting unreasonable bail are called out, or disciplined, most are not. Chances are very good you will not be able to afford bail if you go inside. Think about that next time you're tempted to flip off a police officer. I'm having a hard time finding specifics about the time between an arrest and a bail hearing, but pages I visit says it varies state by state, with multiple lawyers giving anecdotes of people waiting up to a year in jail before being -acquitted- because they couldn't make bail. Personally, I have known more than one person to spend months in jail after being unable to afford bail. Whether or not someone is found guilty, shouldn't this be viewed as a violation of our right to a speedy trial? Not sure about that one. [Here] are some statistics on drug bail. [Here] is a document full of prison statistics, most relevantly, bail rates. Bottom line: You don't have rights anymore. Each of the constitutional rights we have were set forth by Americans to protect their families from overzealous government officials. These rights are not there to protect you from your neighbors. They aren't there to protect you from your employer. They were written specifically to protect you from the Government, and they have failed. Remember your history, read the constitution. Every one of the rights Americans hold dear is being violated by police, judges, and politicians every day. Every Day. EVERY DAY. Every bullshit arrest, every bullshit sentence, every bullshit traffic stop, every bullshit roadside search. If you try to exercise your right to free speech, you can be stopped for it. If you argue with the officer, he will pull you out of the car for an arrest and search without warrant. If you resist him in any way, or if you can't hear him, or if you step on the brake pedal by mistake, or if you just don't fall on your face quickly enough, he will shoot you. Those are the facts. Every year, another generation of high-school students reads 1984, by Orwell. They tell us what to buy, and at what price (medicine, insurance). They tell us our wars are moral, or economically sound. They tell us who to love (media, soldiers,'heros. They tell us who to hate (war, media, socialists, WBC). We are in a constant state of war on at least one front (Germany, Vietnam, Korea, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, Russia, Mexico, and God only knows where else). They lie to us, and suppress anyone looking for the truth (media, arrest of journalists, denying the right to assemble or film officers). They tell us what to believe. They tell us how to behave. They will kill you if you do not fall in line exactly when and how they tell you. It might not look like you live in a police state. After all, you can drive to work, do your job, buy your groceries, and go on vacation. However, if a police officer, a judge, or anyone else has the authority to ignore the Constitution of the United States of America, what else can you call it? Do I need to dare you to piss off a cop? If you know what will happen when you piss off a cop, how can you accept that? Why are police even authorized to use deadly force? You really want them to kill someone for speeding? Well what about stealing your car, can we kill them then? How many lives are saved through the use of deadly force? Is it worth it? Well it isn't worth it to me. I'm going to keep my head down until I can afford to get the Hell out of here. I'd rather Live as a citizen of the World than Die as a citizen of this country. If you think the constitution protects you (at all), think again. They are walking all over your rights, and you aren't going to notice until they arrest you, or kill your children. If they never do, you will live your life among the sheeple, waiting for the law to tell you how to live. I'm sorry if this comes across as somewhat belligerent, but I believe the seriousness of the situation in this country isn't exactly sinking in for the general public. Am I wrong? Is it already getting better? Are citizens safer than they used to be? Is my information wrong or biased?

{"original_text": "I hold this view because I have read that conspiracy theorists have a common trait: they are trapped in a belief system, and that any opposing view, no matter how much evidence it is supported by, is seen by them as more than an attack on their opinion, instead as an attack against them personally. I haven't studied religion in any great depth, I am not a religious person, and I was brought up in a tolerant family who weren't particularly religious either.

She's been in more controversy over the years than anybody can keep track of. She's got almost unanimous support from the Democratic party, and lord knows she can afford good speechwriters and campaign managers.

To me, the fact that this \"quotable\" passed through all the levels of Clinton's campaign team is just an indicator of how little anyone working for Clinton (including herself) really gives a shit. She could wake up tomorrow and say she intends on starting a nuclear war with Iran, and she'd still get the Democratic nomination.

My wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country. I will reflect on my mother's story. She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country. When she came to this country she was on government assistance. With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master's Degree. Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community. I don't need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent's generation, their hard work and sacrifice. I hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country. I've read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings. However I don't completely buy into it. I've seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education. As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I'll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do. At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint. As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings. They had no problems acting'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america. That is why I don't have compassion for the narrative that is pushed in the media for the poor black or hispanic american unable to rise from poverty. I know this is a strong talking point for the right wing yet I have not read any tangible counter argument to the dispute the Poor Asian immigrant story. If there are books or articles which provides a cogent counter argument please feel free to share. TL:DR - The rationale for why blacks and Hispanics are unsuccessful in the U.S. are bunk because of the success of Asian Immigrants. Edit: This is not to say that there isn't racism in society, especially towards Asians. Colleges definitely try to make it harder for Asians to get admitted despite higher scores, and there is a Bamboo Ceiling in the workplace. However, I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture. Edit2: I appreciate the dialogue. One point which I'll concede and am swayed from the dialogue is that racism, more specifically the historic racism perpetrated in the U.S. such as Jim Crow and Slavery created the culture which is present in the poor black community, hindering them from rising from poverty. But nothing disputes that this culture is reason, and not the present-day racism that is preventing them from achieving in this country. That is what I have issue against that the media portrays a image of victimization due to current day racism, however, I don't think the type of racism is the cause, maybe past racism, but not the type minorities face today. If no one has a counter argument against the cultural aspect, shouldn't black culture, the one that glamorizes the baller lifestyle, be the focused of policy makers to change rather than focusing their efforts on social restructuring to accomodate the culture?

{"original_text": "Over the past year, the idea of raising the minimum wage in Canada (where I live) and in the USA has gained popularity. Many states and provinces are either mandating, or in the process of mandating a minimum wage of 15hour. While on the surface, this seems like a good policy for strengthening the poormiddle class I believe this will ultimately HURT, not help the public, and especially the poor. Here are several common arguments made in favour of the raising minimum wage and my response: \"Average wages haven't increased despite an increase in production and profit in the economy\" It's a common misunderstanding that wages areshould be directly tied to production. In reality wages are determined just like prices of anything else, through supply and demand. Most minimum wage jobs are unskilled and easily replaceable (through either humans or automation) making the supply of labour far larger than the demand, which equals a lower wage. The rise in technology that has resulted in higher production from labour has little affect on wages. \"Current minimum wages are so low that they do not pay a livable annual salary, keeping the working poor in a perpetual state of poverty\" I would challenge the idea that most minimum wage jobs were ever meant to be sustainable for living. Most minimum wage jobs are unskilled labour (ex. factory work, assembly lines) or service industry jobs (cooks, janitorial staff, retail jobs etc..). At least to me, these seem like temporary work done by people in the process of finding higher paying employment (students, recent graduates, new immigrants etc...), and not intended as a career at all, so a livable wage is not required. \"A higher minimum wage would increase the income of many in the population, boosting spending, saving and the overall economy.\" As I said previously, the vast majority of minimum wage jobs are easily replaceable, outsourced or automated. If large companies are forced by government to pay high minimum wages, they will seek cheaper alternatives and replacements instead. For example, a McDonald's hamburger could very easily be made faster, cheaper, cleaner and better by a machine, [like this one, which makes a burger every 10 seconds ] . If the minimum wage gets high enough that it costs McDonald's more to pay 10 people to flip burgers than one machine, they will simply replace the human labour altogether. This will result in an increase in unemployment. So while those who retain their minimum wage jobs will be better off, many will simply be replaced, leaving the unemployed workers in a WORSE position than before. Here are some things that would change my view: Research evidence that demonstrates positive impact from countriesstates that have already raised minimum wage A justification that the minimum wage must be a \"living wage\" Evidence that a wage increase would not result in the loss of unskilled jobs to outsourcing, automation etc...

I also noticed even women who have a lot of male friends they spent a lot of time with and \"friend zoned\" them, they would still get weird and upset if the man was in a romantic relationship and therefore had less time to expend for her because it was going to his SO. This doesn't happen with their male friends as long as they see them enough because the male friends aren't using their male friends to feel attractive... but suddenly \"just\" female friends tend to get very territorial once they aren't getting the attention from the male friend that they were used to or able to get that constant validation.

{"original_text": "Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from your basic youth teams) and never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing it was simple as that. By losing and not being rewarded we understood we had to try harder as an individual and try harder as a team to win. This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team. I really dont understand the idea of rewarding everyone for not winning, it's almost like saying \"hey, even if you dont try you still win.\" I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why? Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize. To me that just teaches a kid that NOT giving your best will still result in a prize. What lesson does that teach you when you grow up? That your failure or lack of effort will be rewarded regardless of how you performed? Doesn't that give the child a bad mentality growing up? Personally if I had a kid and heshe played a sport I wouldn't allow the coach or a parent to give them a trophy for simply participating, I would make them understand that a rewardtrophy is earned by hard work and dedication. I know not all kids are athletic but I still dont understand the concept or idea. We all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? Again, I am not trying to sound cold but I just dont understand the concept of rewarding failurelosing, CMV...... Edit: thanks for all the answers, feedback and insight. Many of you helped CMV. Again, I hope I didn't come off as cold or inconsiderate. I have younger cousins and love to see them succeed in anything they do, especially sports. I was more interested in having a discussion as to \"why\" and the mentality behind it. Many of you made valid arguments and gave me some great insight. I'm happy to keep discussing if people are interested but please note I am not against the idea but was more interested in helping me change my view of it. If anything please continue to give your children positive feedback, effective communication, motivation and let them know that team work is a great thing. I recommend everyone put their kids in sports (dont push them into it but help and guide them into something they love doing or are very passionate about). It really does pay off when you get older and helps them build some self confidence and understand the dynamics of a social environment. Thanks again everyone! Edit 2: Since the discussion continues, I think children under 12 should only get participation Trophies. Once you hit that age you should be teaching your kids the fundamentals of structured team work, effort and the idea that life will not reward your for simply showing up. Giving participation trophies to kids 13 and above is not a good life lesson. If you care to continue CMV on that! Edit 3: Thanks everyone for the continued conversation, input, points of views and personal experiences. This sub is great for people who are curious as to get the other sides opinion and everyone should keep an open mind about changing their view on the matter. Now some last bit of advice for coaches and parents who put their kids in sports. PLEASE keep your eye out for the that one un-athletic kid who might not be the best on the team and make sure that hisher team mates understand this is a team event and that everyone is in this together. Some of these personal experiences shared with me shed some light on how people hated playing sports and were being bulled because they were that kid and the other kids made them feel left out. Not all kids will be good athletes but you can teach your kids to respect one another, support one another and to ensure that they understand the unity of team work. If your kid is that \"all-star\" on the team then make them understand this most because the other kids will look to himher to see how they treat the rest of the team. A good leader will understand this and this habit will grow with them, you just have to show them how and why. Thanks again for all the input, this is a great sub.", "text_perturb": "hullo CMV , I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer ( worked my way up to the competitive teams from your basic youth teams ) and neer once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st , 2nd , 3rd or you got nothing it cost simple as that. By losing and not be rewarded we understood we had to try harder as an individual and try harder as a team to win. This led me to suit much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team. I really dont understand the idea of rewarding everyone for not winning , it 's almost like suppose `` hey , even if you dont try you still win. `` I hear stories about team that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy , why ? Do n't get me wrong , I 'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize. To me that just teaches a kid that NOT make your best will still result in a prize. What lesson does that teach you when you grow up ? That your failure or lack of effort will be rewarded regardless of how you performed ? Does n't that give the child a regretful mentality growing up ? Personally if I had a kid and heshe played a sport I would n't allow the coach or a parent to give them a trophy for simply participating , I would make them understand that a rewardtrophy is earned by hard work and dedication. I know not all kids are athletic but I still dont understand the concept or theme. We all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off ? Again , I am not trying to sound cold but I just dont understand the construct of rewarding failurelosing , CMV. . . . . . Edit : thanks for all the solution , feedback and insight. Many of you helped CMV. Again , I hope I did n't total off as cold or inconsiderate. I have younger cousins and have it away to see them succeed in anything they do , especially sports. I was more interested in having a discussion as to `` why '' and the brain behind it. many of you made valid arguments and gave me some great insight. I 'm happy to keep on discussing if people are interested but please note I am not against the idea but was more interested in helping me change my view of it. If anything please continue to give your children positive feedback , effective communication , motivation and let them know that team work is a great matter. I recommend everyone put their kids in sports ( dont push them into it but help and guide them into something they love doing or constitute very passionate about ). It really does pay off when you get older and avail them build some self confidence and understand the dynamics of a social environment. Thanks over again everyone ! Edit 2 : Since the discussion continues , I think children under 12 should only get participation Trophies. Once you attain that age you should be teaching your kids the fundamentals of structured team work , effort and the idea that life will not reward your for simply showing up. pass on participation trophies to kids 13 and above is not a good life lesson. If you care to continue CMV on that ! Edit 3 : Thanks everyone for the continued conversation , input , points of survey and personal experiences. This sub is great for people who are curious as to get the other sides opinion and everyone should keep an open mind about changing their thought on the matter. Now some last bit of advice for jitney and parents who put their kids in sports. PLEASE keep your eye out for the that one un-athletic kid who might not be the best on the team and realize sure that hisher team mates understand this is a team event and that everyone is in this together. Some of these personal experiences shared with me shed some light on how people hated playing sports and were being bulled because they were that kid and the early kids made them feel left out. Not all kids will be good athletes but you can teach your kids to respect one another , sustenance one another and to ensure that they understand the unity of team work.

Essentially my viewpoint is that making fun of, or telling an individual who chooses to follow these diets that they are naive and trying to convince them not to follow them is just as bad as making fun of, or saying the same things to a religious individual, such as a Muslim or Jew who cannot eat pork or must eat halal, or kosher food. In both instances there is no general scientific consensus that agrees with the choices the individuals make; however, in both cases the individuals feel good about their choices whether it be because they feel like they are following the will of their God, or because they believe they are eating healthier. I do make an exception for diets which are unsustainable and will eventually cause either malnutrition or an eating disorder etc... but some diets, such as gluten free or dairy free, do not cause this issue, and the individuals feel great when they do it, whether or not it is a placebo or a result of other factors is irrelevant. I see a lot of hate on people who follow these diets on the internet and in person and I don't really understand why. If the individuals is an adult and chooses to practice this lifestyle we should respect it as much as we respect individuals who practice their religions.

I do make an exception for diets which live unsustainable and will eventually cause either malnutrition or an eating disorder etc. . . but some diets , such as gluten free or dairy free , do not cause this issue , and the individuals sense great when they do it , whether or not it is a placebo or a result of other factors is irrelevant. I see a lot of hate on people who follow these diets on the internet and in mortal and I do n't really understand why. If the someone is an adult and chooses to practice this lifestyle we should respect it as much as we respect someone who practice their religions. In both subject I agree that if they shove it in people 's faces and try to convert people they know , it is annoying , but if they keep to themselves and understand that it is not for everyone , I do n't see a reason for all the hate on people who follow these lifestyles.

{"original_text": "Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). This has potentially shaped my ideas on the matter but I thought I'd throw it out there. Please don't judge me on my politics but on the content of the CMV. I believe that in a free society people have the right to decide whether they should keep a baby or not, women have the right to abort or raise a child. However I believe that men deserve the same right after sex with regards to the child (it takes two to tango). If a mother decides to keep the child then the father deserves the right to accept, or opt out of, fatherhood including all of the repercussions and payments that could be associated with such. I understand that the state assumes the right of the child the right of the parent, however I believe strongly that the father has the right to continue to live his life without sinking payments into a child which was optionally chosen. If a man decides he does not want to keep the child then he has the right to refrain from supporting it throughout its life. Or on the opposite, if a mother is given the option to keep a child, willingly knowing the father does not want to, then she is accepting the responsibility of raising a child by herself, as she has no right to enforce payments on a consenting man who did not wish to have a child. Obviously this excludes rape and all other implications, this is only within consensual sex. TL;DR: Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood, and refuse payments for a child they did not wish to claim responsibility for, in a consensual Pro-Choice environment. EDIT: Slight confusioncomments regarding abortion, I believe that it is solely the woman's responsibility as to whether she should abort or not, it is her \"pro choice,\" however fathers have the right to \"opt out\" of fatherhood, or responsibility for that child should the mother keep it. EDIT2: This is going pretty well, some good discussions. As suggested another way to put this would be'Committing to sex is not committing to parenthood.\" TheScamr worded this nicely: Right now a woman cannot be compelled to be a mother, either financially, custodially or emotionally due to abortion or adoption. Pro choice advocates say when a woman consents to sex she is not consenting to motherhood. OP is asking whether men should also be free such compulsion and the same condition: consent to sex is not consent to fatherhood, either financially, custodially or emotionally. EDIT3: This has sparked a really nice and balanced discussion, so thank you CMV. It's a controversial topic because while Men should have the same rights as Women, the rights of the child seem to take over that of the father, but not the mother.

{"original_text": "This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding. For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force you to pay for large bundles of channels that you might not even want. Streaming services like Hulu and Netflix have offered a great way to circumvent that process at a much more affordable price and are completely changing the way we view content. And yet I still see so many people getting so wound up over watching ads on Hulu. My perception of their argument is this: \"I pay for Hulu, so I shouldn't have to see ads.\" Maybe I'm over-simplifying it, but I just haven't seen any other viable argument that really says anything beyond that. Now, I should say I definitely understand hating ads. I live in the city, and I can't walk ten feet out my door without someone trying to sell me something. We are over-saturated by advertising and it's awful. Thankfully with more options to block advertising on the internet, it's forcing advertisers to create ads that are more entertaining and feel less obtrusive (although, sometimes it does also force the opposite). But even though I hate advertising as much as a lot of people do, I still recognize it as a vital part of what makes television work, and since I really like being able to know what happens on my favorite shows every week, I don't get my panties in a twist over it. I see a lot of people getting wound up who have little understanding of how a service like Hulu works. I'm certainly not an expert either, but I have an understanding of how the licensing process works and how expensive it can be. Netflix may be able to get by without ads, but Hulu offers something that Netflix doesn't: content from television that is current and has recently aired. Netflix usually won't provide new episodes of a show until an entire season is finished. And even then, it might be a few months until even that happens. The only current content they do have is their own original programming, which they can get away with because they own the licenses and don't have to pay any licensing fees or performance royalties to any outside production company. I've seen a lot of my favorite shows on Hulu have episodes be online just hours after it airs on live TV. Since I dropped cable years ago, this is one of my favorite things about it. I don't necessarily like that advertising is part of my subscription, but I also realize that Hulu has to license this content from production companies, who have had a history of being apprehensive when it comes to embracing changing technologies. They are likely charging much higher licensing fees and royalties which means that Hulu in turns has to find other sources of income beyond subscription fees in order to make it work. Not to mention that the networks themselves probably have their own fees since they probably have exclusivity deals with the production companies who make the programming. People are so quick to jump to the \"X company is a bunch of greedy corporate whores\" argument without understand the major complexities that go into making a service like Hulu work. I'm sure Hulu is well aware that their subscribers don't like watching ads. \"I don't like watching ads\" is even an option in their survey when you cancel your account. People went on the same tirade when Netflix raised its prices, and I remember thinking the same thing then. I think that people's displeasure with advertising will ultimately shift services in the direction of removing advertising, but I still think that's a long way off. Streaming services, despite being around for several years now, are still in their infancy in a lot of ways. It's going to take a while to allow everyone to adapt and a lot of companies will be resistant to it in the hopes they can retain their old business models. But I don't see any of this as the fault of Hulu for using advertising. So my real curiosity here is to find an argument against Hulu's advertising that I haven't seen. I see so many people upset about it, but I feel like my only understanding of their argument is that they're spoiled and don't want to see ads, which I recognize can be straw-manning on my part. I'd like to see if someone can shift my bias and provide me some insight I'm not aware of. EDIT: uceader is the one who ultimately changed my view.

{"original_text": "Dear reader, let me re-introduce you to an argument known as Pascal's Wager , which you probably know about if you decided to look here. From Wikipedia: It posits that humans all bet with their lives either that God exists or not. Given the possibility that God actually does exist and assuming an infinite gain or loss associated with belief or unbelief in said God (as represented by an eternity in heaven or hell), a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.). Pascal formulated the wager within a Christian framework. I am addressing the counter-arguments of \"Nature as not a proof of the existence of God\" and \"Argument from inauthentic belief,\" which you should read about if you would like to talk to me about those. Since I'm not great at reported speech, I will quote the thoughts of my imaginary atheist: I am an atheist. I believe there is no deity or higher power which governs nature. As such, I am most probably damned by a great number of religions. If I love my child, and if wish it well, I must do everything in my power to secure that. One of those things is instilling faith into my child. I should feign faith, as hard as I can, to make my child a believer, and a practicing one, at best. That way, their faith will be sincere and strong, even if mine is not, saving them, and MAYBE EVEN me in the process.

This, its proponents argue, would lead to a high probability of believing in \"the wrong god,\" which, they claim, eliminates the mathematical advantage Pascal claimed with his Wager. e but even so, instilling ANY faith could still be better than NO faith, more because a number of deities value believers more than non-believers.

{"original_text": "New here, so please correct me if I am doing anything wrong. Before I begin I want to point out that this is strictly opinionated and based off of personal observations. Also my grammar isn't the best so please forgive any errors. The main issue I have with marriage is the consequences of ending it. I do understand that this can be avoided to a degree with prenuptial agreements however, they are generally frowned upon. The idea of penalizing someone for ending a failing relationship seems counterproductive to me. This creates a sense of security to those who have refrained from showing or disclosing certain habits or personality traits to their spouse. It also encourages many to \"let themselves go.\" By that I mean things such as weight gain, poor hygiene, addictions, etc. Secondly, I have seen in many cases where there is just no repairing the relationship, yet the couple remains together due to the financial repercussions of ending their failed marriage. This ultimately leads to a very uncomfortable situation at home, especially for children. It also in many cases leads to infidelity which brings a plethora of problems itself. All of that said, my opinion is probably a bit biased due to my now divorced parents' marriage, but I am open to hear other arguments on the issue. Edit: First off, I'd like to thank everyone for their responses. I'd just like to clear up some things I didn't communicate well in my post. 1. By penalizing I wasn't just referring to spousal support and alimony but the legal fees as well. 2. The argument I made was not meant to necessarily knock the institution of marriage because I do think it can work but there does exist many problems with how a failed marriage is dealt with...at least here in the US. My issue is mainly with society's expectation that long term relationships must eventually lead to marriage when it is not for everyone.

{"original_text": "The fact that men are disadvantaged in child custody cases is appalling. So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely to be arrested than the ACTUAL PERPETRATOR. That's disgusting, and obviously I could list many other real problems. But the MRM is not the best solution to these problems, and often gives men's issues such bad press that it's toxic to defend them. In other words, it's not the MRM's fault that these problems exist, but it's actively damaging to the cause, quite possibly more than it has helped. Distancing itself from feminism breaks the gender equality world into \"men's activists\" and \"women's activists.\" This causes us to ignore that gender inequality is bad for everyone. No one wins when a man is arrested for being assaulted by a woman. This is not a victory for women's rights. Everyone loses, because a criminal walks free while an innocent person sits in jail. Sure, there are extremists who will claim to hate all men and think this is fine, but there are also crazy atheists who claim to hate all religious people. This isn't \"no true Scotsman,\" this is pointing out that it's unreasonable to define a group by its crazies, because if we did, no group would be reasonable. Pitting MRAs against feminists undermines the notion of actual gender equality and makes it a \"men vs. women\" debate, which we all lose. It would seem, to me, that a better strategy to promote men's issues would be to do it within the feminist movement. The feminist movement has existed for a long time and (relative to the MRM) is reasonably positively regarded. People get behind feminist issues. MRAs often complain that no feminists care about men's issues, but a) this doesn't seem to be entirely true unless we're yelling about strawmen and extremists and b) this would be even less true if people stopped leaving feminismgender egalitarianism for the MRM. It looks like people are ditching feminism for the MRM and then complaining that feminists don't care about men's issues, which is only true because anyone who did left. Why can't we all just work together? I get that there are people who identify with all of the above, but it seems like EVERYONE who considers themselves ANY of the above should care about all of the above. I really can't think of an intellectually honest reason to care only about men's issues or women's issues. They're both real. So why are we treating them as opposing forces? It's not like we have to ban abortions because we start listening to male victims of violence. This isn't a zero sum game, why is it being treated as one? Everyone seems to think it is, and it just doesn't make sense to me. Some things I anticipate people saying: \"What about gender egalitarians?\" I think rebranding feminism as gender egalitarianism would probably be the best solution, but that's going to take a hell of a lot of time. One thing that would help is if feminists started acting like gender egalitarians and actually cared about all gender issues, and MRAs joining up with them would only speed up the process. As for people who consider themselves \"feminists and gender egalitarians,\" I see no issue. \"Feminist, MRA, and gender egalitarian\" is fine too, although I've never encountered one who phrased it like that. Those who consider themselves anti-feminists but gender egalitarians.... Eh. I really don't know, but I feel like shitting on feminism in general is not helpful to the gender equality discussion. (this is as opposed to legitimate critiquing, which is fair game. I'm not saying anything anyone labelled \"feminist\" does is above reproach, nor anything the movement does. I'm saying condemning all of modern feminism and trying to start from scratch is really unhelpful, especially when a huge part of the world is still incredibly patriarchal; see countries where getting raped is still a crimeif you're female). \"Feminists aren't open to men's issues. I hear what you're saying, but that's not possible.\" Become a feminist open to men's issues. You're listening to one right now. Make that two and we're one step closer. \"It's right for men's and women's issues to have different advocates because they are different. You might as well be saying that feminism should just merge with the LGBTQ rights movement.\" I don't think that's true. Men's and women's issues differ, but they are rooted in the same fundamental ideas. The reason men are arrested when they are the victim of domestic violence by women is that we live in a society that sees women differently from men. It's benevolently sexist to say that a woman simply couldn't hurt a man except in self-defense. It's also hostile sexist against men to say that men are simply violent people. Men's and women's issues are intrinsically linked, because stereotypes and perceptions of gender roles are the root of both. Essentially, I think men's and women's issues are symptoms of the same problem, so they can be addressed together. \"Is your problem with anti-feminists, or MRAs? You seem to move between the two.\" Both, to some degree. I don't think it's fair to treat those two entirely separately, given the links. MRAs who are anti-feminist are the ones I disagree with most. People who identify as MRAs but also feminists I'm largely okay with, but the MRM in general is not terribly kind to feminists and borders on actively anti-feminist, which is the problem I'm talking about here.

{"original_text": "I think that women's gymnastics is a harmful sport that should be excluded from the Olympics. First, since the gold medal winners in gymnastics are usually 16-18, success in the sport depends more on the coaching than on the individual skills and drive of the athletes involved. Second, I feel like the coaching in the sport is especially abusive as it is seen as a method of motivation. Third, I think the age scandals in gymnastics are a huge problem that won't be solved as age is such a large factor in success. Fourth, I personally believe it is wrong to put such pressure on teenage athletes. I realize that these reasons aren't as important in male gymnastics, which has a wider range of ages, but I think that both would have to be excluded if either was excluded. I also realize that gymnasts are incredible athletes and that some of the female gymnasts are self-motivated at that age. Overall, though, I think it is a harmful Olympic sport.", "text_perturb": "I retrieve that women 's gymnastics is a harmful sport that should be excluded from the Olympics.

{"original_text": "After Pearl Harbor, FDR gave the order to round up Japanese-Americans and other similar immigrants in internment camps based on the (flawed) idea that they might or would betray America for their native country. Even though the Supreme Court upheld the executive order 9066 under Korematsu v. US and its precedent has not been overturned, I doubt that another administration would dare attempt to intern a whole race of Americans again, regardless of circumstances (except under the one specific case of a widespread epidemic that was tied to a race-based genetic aliment like Tay-Sachs disease). Not only would the targeted population rebel, I'd guess that a significant majority of the citizenry would oppose the measure. Moreover, it would probably be grounds of impeachment of the president.
