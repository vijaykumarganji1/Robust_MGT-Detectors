God intentionally engineered the whole of creation to be utterly misleading when confronted with rational investigation. All of this was done as an implicit test of faith.

{"original_text": "Sorry, this is mostly applicable to folks from the US, but feel free to weigh in no matter what. I'll bullet-point for my reasoning: More good folks are killed via firearms than are saved by them. The vast majority of firearm deaths are via suicide, which has an incredibly high success rate compared to all other methods. Therefore since firearms cause more deaths than they prevent, firearms pose a net-loss for society. One major reason we believe we need firearms is the 2nd amendment. The 2nd amendment is essentially an axiom; in order to have a moral argument as to why we should have guns, I don't think \"because the 2nd amendment says so\" is compelling. If the 2nd amendment told us to punch babies, that wouldn't make it okay. Therefore whether or not firearms are truly acceptable must be for a reason outside of this. Our logical balance doesn't make sense. To paraphrase John Oliver, one guy tried to blow up a plane with a shoe and now we all take our shoes off at security. But so many people shoot up so many schools, and we still haven't done anything substantial about it. On a similar note, we invest how many trillions of dollars on the war on terror, and yet the amount of Americans killed via guns exceeds the amount killed via terrorism by an extraordinary amount. I've read Scalia's opinion in D.C. v. Heller (The most important guns case in modern times). I don't find the appeal to history compelling. It seems to me that times have changed so much that arguing what Thomas Jefferson was thinking and then applying it to semi-automatic and automatic weapons just doesn't make sense. For someone who claims to be a textualist, this appears to me to be a stretch. The 2nd amendment and it's current interpretation quashes any possibility of experimentation. I think part of the American experiment is to allow different states to try different things. One of the arguments for gun rights is \"what worked for Australia couldn't work for us.\" And yet one only needs to look at Chicago (the city banned some firearms, SCOTUS said that was unacceptable and ruled against Chicago's law) to see that we were never given a chance to figure out what worked. I would normally suggest an amendment if we wanted to clarify the 2nd amendment for modern times, but it seems to me that nobody will ever be convinced guns are bad (or good!) until we have a concrete application and see whether it works or not. Edit: Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be a space in which I can respond to anyone without being heavily downvoted.

{"original_text": "Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in comparison to other nations in categories such as [infrastructure] , [poverty rates] , [education] , and so on. Usually, these show other nations, typically Scandinavian and other European countries, consistently coming out on top. This leads to a somewhat negative and unhealthy perception of America for both citizens and non-citizens that I think is unfair. This is because, in my view, there are 3 factors which hinder America's ability to keep up with its developed nation counter parts: Land Size Population Cultural Heterogeneity First, here is a top 5 list of the largest nations on Earth by square mileage, in order from largest to smallest: Russia Canada China United States Brazil The US is the 4th largest country on the planet, and as such, I think its ability to manage and update infrastructure is limited. A bullet train similar to those in Europe would be difficult in the US. Also, land from coast to coast is extremely diverse, ranging from plains, to mountains, to desert, to swamps, and so forth. Such a diverse biome requires diverse management of resources and is pretty difficult in my opinion. Now here's a top 5 list of countries by population, from largest to smallest: China India United States Indonesia Brazil Not only is America massive in terms of land area, it has a massive population as well. This high population puts financial strain on social nets, public education, and other public programs that can lead to problems. (This is not to say America wisely spends its money on its people, but that is a separate argument for another day). And yet compared to the other 4 most populous nations, it still maintains a high standard of living, relatively low poverty rate, and economic mobility. The only other country that hangs with America in both categories is China, which is massive in size and population. But America differs from China in one way, which is my third point a heterogeneous culture. The US was founded by immigrants, as a nation of immigrants, and diversity is only growing into the future. America features such a mixing pot of ethnicity and culture that it makes it difficult to enact programs that benefit everyone equally. I think this is most evident in education, where the US has the difficult task of creating a system that benefits every child in the best way possible. In China, a largely homogeneous population with high value on education should produce high results. And yet, despite having all three of these factors to consider, the United States is ranked [5th on the Human Development Index] as late as 2014. So, basically my argument is this The United States, being huge in size, huge in population, and having a heterogeneous culture, is at an instant disadvantage in comparison to other nations, and is doing pretty well for itself all things considered.

Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who can stop the Joker. Additionally, it is obvious that Arkham cannot hold him.

Ostensibly, Batman's no-killing policy is a self imposed check on his inner demons that he is sure will consume him if he gives into them.

{"original_text": "This is a long one... I greatly appreciate any thoughtful responses, feel free to ask any clarifying questions needed- I've left out some of the evidence for my claims to keep this \"short\" I was thinking about this question in reference to a specific question I was asked a long time ago: If you are walking in a oark and you see a child drowning in a pond, are you morally obligated to save them (or assist them in any way)? For starters, obviously I would. I would also think it obvious that anyone who is able should. But that's not the question. It's very important that you keep in mind, I'm notasking about any of the following: Do you have a societal obligation to save them Would you feel obligated to help Do you have a responsibility to do so Would you judge someone for not saving them Should it be illegal to ignore them Again, I am not asking any of these questions, as I believe that any decent human would hop in and save the kid. I'll even suspend judgement if you want to take the time to take your shoes off and put your phone in them. I came to the conclusion that you are not in fact morally obligated to help. Consider the analogy between saving the drowning girl and using your time money to save starving children in another country. What is the difference? They are farther away, they are not part of your community, you can't see the help you provide, you can't see them suffer in the first place, you don't know for sure if you are helping by sending money, it would be much more difficult to provide direct assistance, they have longer to live from the time we would decide to help, they may recieve help from someone else. None of those reasons would be an excuse to ignore a moral obligation. If we truly believed that it was our moral obligation to help the drowning child, why would it not also be our obligation to help every other human in need according to our closest approximation of how we could theoretically devote our lives to helping the greatest possible number of people. It is of course possible that you believe this in which case almost every human ever is hugely immoral, but I think that defining morality in this way would make the word meaningless, and it is not useful - nor is it a reasonable definition for morality. On the other hand, there is a moral belief system that would treat morality as if you had no obligation to help anyone, and an unwarrented harm would be immoral, whereas helping people or leaving them alone would be considered positive or neutral respectively. If we accept this stance, than leaving the child to drown would be considered a morally neutral (or amoral) action. It would still be considered a horrible thing to do by most anyone, but people's emotional responses have no bearing on objective morality. (there may be exceptions for emotional distress caused by a person, but since our hypothetical passerby is not the cause of the child drowning, you cannot hold him accountable for the emotional consequences) This scenario is also closely related to the train thought experiment, where you are standing by the lever that switches the direction a train is going. On it's current path, it will hit five men. If you change the path, it will hit one man. By the logic I have put forth, it would be immoral to flip the lever, thus condemning the one man, but it would be morally neutral to let the train hit the five men (assuming that no further information or alternatives are available) I would have to reconsider this stance if the analogy were proven false, or a better explanation to the moral dilemmas were presented. I am also operating under the assumtion that morality is objective as it relates to humans, and therefor a principle must be established which applies equally to all scenarios in which your interpritation of what constitutes a moral action can be right or wrong, and is only up for interpritation in cases dealing with immoral agents in which actions that would be considered immoral (like murder) would be considered justified (like murdering someone who is going to murder you).", "text_perturb": "This is a farseeing one. . .

{"original_text": "I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is the far superior option. Cleanliness In this area, I prefer toilet paper for a few reasons. First of all, there is actual visual confirmation that you've got it all. With bidets you just have to keep spraying until you think you're good. And as the amount of wipingbidet-ing can vary greatly, the visual aspect is a great help. (I used a towel to dab afterwards, as toilet paper doesn't hold up against all the water.) Secondly, a bidet shouldn't be necessary as people (should) shower daily. Many people like to point out that bidets are better because they rinse away bacteria and other nastiness. But, a shower with actual soap and water and scrubbing should do that job much better than just water alone. \"But you wouldn't just wipe it away if you got some on your hands!\" No, and I don't think you'd just rinse it away either. You'd use soap and water and scrubbing. Another point, your hands are usually the first thing you use to touch something. Until you grab things with your bare ass, wiping is just as good. Comfort Good quality toilet paper is amazing. It's soft, thick, almost like Kleenex. Hell, you could wipe with Kleenex if you wanted. Point is that high quality stuff is glorious. On the other hand, you're getting a cold spray of water in a very sensitive area. Even if you have a super luxury bidet that uses heated water, it's still basically shooting water up your ass. Even low quality toilet paper is better than that. In a shower the water flows down, which is much less uncomfortable. With a bidet there's also the added trouble of being all drippy with water while you move to towel off. And unless you want to reach into the bowl with a towel while you're still sitting on it, you're going to have to at least move up to a squat to towel off. (Those with an air dryer feature may alleviate this somewhat, but toweling will probably still be necessary if the air hand dryers are anything to go by.) Price I understand bidets cost less. But for me and where I am in life, I can and will pay extra for quality. There must be many others who feel the same, or else only single ply sand paper toilet paper would exist. In this area bidets are better, but I think that if this is the reason someone buys a bidet it would be because they have to save money. Eco friendliness I think we're past the whole'save the trees' business. Reforestation is greater than reforestation in most of the world. Bidets may actually do more harm in low water and drought areas, if everyone dropped toilet paper and got bidets the gallons would add up. To clarify; I'm talking about a bidet for home use, that's built into the toilet. The bidets that are completely separate just seem impractical.

{"original_text": "Please note before reading: Please do not downvote my comments and replies on basis of disagreement. I've done several CMV's where I was the clear minority in terms of viewpoint, and got downvoted on nearly every post. Due to Reddit's karma system, this makes me wait a period of 7 minutes in between replies if my karma is low, and makes it more difficult for me to respond to everyone (the more karma you have, the less time you need to wait to post). If I act like a dick to you, act irrational, or say something logically fallacious, I implore you to downvote me, but I'd really like to be able to discuss with everybody and not be held back by my inability to reply (and consequently hear replies). Okay, onto my view. I'm not worried about the US government spying on citizens, for the following reasons. 1. I don't necessarily \"have nothing to hide,\" but I don't expect that there is literally a person on a computer looking through what I post to Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook (or what porn I look at). I have some personal things I wouldn't want an actual person to know or look through, but I feel entirely comfortable with a machine using a CTRL-F function to search for terrorist activity, or other organized illegal activities since I don't commit any major crime. I know a lot of people are worried about the government seeing people torrenting things illegally or watching moviesshows illegally on the internet, but considering how widely this is done and how nonexistent people are prosecuted for it based on the governments ability to view all this, I'm not worried about it. I don't do drugs, but if I did and tried to buy drugs over FB or text, I doubt the government would even care. We have rtrees for instance, thousands of people openly doing minor illegal things and the government doesn't care enough to try and arrest them. 2. I remember hearing during Rand Paul's filibuster that there has been terrorist activity stopped by government spying on people. I think government spying still has an effect as a deterrent (terrorists can't use media to communicate, and therefore it makes terrorist activity harder to commit. I also heard during the filibuster that the government was using spying to take down organized crime. I'm not worried about that, considering I'm not involved in organized crime and therefore am not worried about it. (I'd like to point out here, that it's not really a view regarding sympathy or empathy towards criminals and what rights they should have to privacy, but simply my feeling of worry about being spied on). I don't view the NSA spying on druglords to be much different than wire taps or undercover officers. 3. In addition to the above, I have the view that Islamic extremism is, as of ISIS' international attacks (or extremist Muslims inspired by ISIS at least), a legitimate threat to the United States. There have been US citizens that have gone to fight for ISIS and local Islamic extremist attacks, and believe the US should be able to spy on their communications. They have claimed to have thousands of people in the US, and while that may be an exaggeration, I don't believe it to be unbelievable considering they have had 150 individuals that have travelled to Syria to fight for ISIS (Source:). I would expect if many people are willing to take the trouble to travel to another country to fight others, it's not unexpected that they more would stay in the US to try and perform terrorist activity here considering it would be easier. 4. I'm not worried about the government knowing my political views. I broadcast them publicly on Facebook, and considering our country's devotion to free speech as well as multiple political parties, I don't view any dissent to be any threat to my well-being.

{"original_text": "The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line, but it is often well after substantial ambiguous conversation. For the purpose of this CMV, I will grant that a fetus is a human person. My views: 1. Abortion may or may not be morally permissible, though I lean towards permissible. I don't really want to discuss this aspect of it, but it's here for some background on my position. 2. Abortion should be legal, based primarily on my foundational belief on bodily autonomy. To change my view, you will probably need to change my belief that the mother's legal right to control her own body overrides the fetus' (or child's) right to use them. One of the main objections to legal abortion is the sense that the woman has incurred a sort of responsibility to the child by engaging in sex (for this CMV, I'd prefer to only consider consensual sex). While this may be true, I see it at most to be a moral obligation, not a legal one. The best analogy I've heard is as follows: Let's say you are driving recklessly and run over a pedestrian. The ambulance arrives and does a quick blood test and determines that unless you donate a pint of blood to that pedestrian, he will die. You hate needles and refuse. At the moment, you cannot be legally compelled to donate your blood. If you can't be compelled to donate blood (which is almost completely safe) to save the life of someone he recklessly endangered, a woman should not be required to donate her internal organs for 9 months to a fetus to keep it alive. EDIT: There are probably other ways in which my view could be changed, but here is the conversation that changed my view first: ugarnteller: So, let's say there was a teleporter accident that caused the second head. You knew it was a risk going in. It will take 9 months for science to clone a body to host the head. Are you still free to kill it? My realization as I thought through the implications: This is again, a very difficult question and I had to put some thought into it before responding. Since we're into sci-fi land, lets look at the probable scenario: In a world where teleportation is a common mode of transport and head grafting was a possible (if somewhat uncommon) outcome, I wouldn't want to travel without knowing that whoever I traveled with (assuming these are the only people who get head-grafted) agreed to keep my head alive until my replacement body could be found. This would be a sort of additional agreement reached between the teleporters. Even in this scenario, I would be very hesitant make it a default law.... but I could easily see that it could become that way if enough people used teleportation and the head-grafting continued to happen. So, I guess the short answer is that I am of the opinion that it should be possible to sign away a certain level of bodily autonomy to secure a level of personal safety. After all, you could be the grafted head next time. This seems to severely impact my position, since an actual analogous scenario would be where the teleporter picks up a random person (who did not choose to teleport) and has their head grafted to their body. I guess if a fetus really is a person, it probably should be illegal to abort it. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"original_text": "For the purpose of this post, I am defining \"capitalism\" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. \"Socialism\" is defined as a system in which the government owns the means of production, and distributes all things necessary for decent quality of life (food, water, shelter, education, health care, etc) for free to all minors and any adult either working, seeking work, or enrolled in school. I understand that this definition is more specific than the true definition of socialism, but I want to preempt any arguments suggesting that people won't look for work if everything is provided for them anyway; they won't be provided for unless they contribute. Also, please note that I am not advocating any specific system of governance; I don't want a debate about the merits of direct democracy. Assume that the system of governance is something effective and relatively democratic, unless there is a compelling reason why my definition of socialism ensures ineffective government. With that out of the way, here is my justification. I believe that capitalism ensures exploitation of the lower-classes. The winners in a capitalist system are nearly always those who were born into relative wealth already. Even the rags-to-riches stories of our time, such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, they were all born into at least lower-middle class. Those trapped in poverty are normal people, who usually work much harder than the people at the top, and get nothing for it. I don't mean to put down high-ranking executives, or other wealthy individuals, but I think that if capitalism is designed to benefit those who work hard, it's doing a shoddy job. Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair. And that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression. Not only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a \"Green!\" or \"Eco-Friendly\" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot). So, with those reasons put out for why capitalism is bad, here's why I think socialism is better. Socialism prevents needless death and suffering by ensuring that everyone who contributes gets everything they need for a healthy life. Socialism ends cyclical poverty by giving everyone a chance at education, without worries about putting food on the table. Socialism is better for rewarding the hard-workers and punishing the slackers, because without unfair head starts going to rich kids entering the workforce, the real cream will rise to the top (there would be variable wages and such; the government employers could offer raises and promotions to their best workers). Socialism is better for the environment, because the government could have direct control, and would have much more incentive to manage the environment in sustainable ways than short-term-minded corporations. I guess I can go further in depth in my replies, if needed. I'm looking for a good debate, and maybe a change of heart. Change my view! EDIT: OK all, so I have been persuaded by a combination of factors that socialism as I define it is not as good as capitalism with generous welfare policies and heavy regulations (think Nordic model). I'll be giving out deltas now. I will continue debating as well, but I think I'm done for now. I will resume later. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It should be the other way around, if only for practical reasons (the respect of older people tend to be far more valuable). Now, I'm in no way denying that younger folks have valid and interesting contribution to make. I think a fresh perspective coupled with energy and enthusiasm can be an exceptional driving force. Nor am I denying that older folks can be complete assholes because their certainly can. However, I could never bring myself to expect older, more experience and better established people to prove themselves to me. Neither can I see a reason to prove myself to younger people today. I expect respect the same way my father or professors did. Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers. Simply put, I find this phrase respect is earned, not given is most often used pompously by younger people to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason. To my eye, this attitude is the product of four big misconceptions: 1) Older people demand respect because of their age and age by itself isn't worthy of respect. I do agree that age by itself isn't a quality worthy of respect, but I don't think older folks demand respect in virtue of their age alone either. Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life. 2) Showing respect and deference to others cost me something. Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self.

Relating to the second point, what's the price of respecting someone by default? Worst case scenario, you change your mind later on. Best case scenario, you've done the right thing. 4) You need to prove yourself. False. Plenty of people \"proved themselves\" already and they shouldn't need to do it again.

I suppose if you can perceive and understand \"BuzzFeed News\" as separate from the rest of BuzzFeed, it's alright.

They are basically the death of journalism. They focus on vague clickbait headlines for the sole purpose of gather views ultimately to make the most ad money possible. I feel this is clearly a sign of a lack of journalistic integrity. Headlines are meant to inform, not confuse. \"Obama said something AMAZING at the state of the union, and you won't believe the reaction!\" What is that?! That's not informing me, bringing me valuable information. It's vague, biased, uninformative, and purely designed just to get a click. Buzzfeed also focuses on native advertisement and meaningless lists which makes it dangerous for the uniformed who cannot discern between what is news and what isn't and ultimately lose a valuable skill in determining what is a good source and what is not. They also plagiarize, which immediately makes an institution lose all credibility. I've had this view for a while and mostly kept to myself about it, but last night someone brought the topic up and to my surprise a journalism student actually started to praisedefend BuzzFeed. So I figured I would post the big counter points she made and why they aren't legitimate. 1. BuzzFeed has a large base \"BuzzFeed has revolutionized how news organizations attract viewership and the mass consumption of BuzzFeed show it's prowess in journalism. Journalism is about consumption\" This is a silly point. Just because a lot of people read BuzzFeed does not mean it is a legitimate news organization. Sure, it's impressive BuzzFeed can attract so many people to their site through social media and clickbait, but so what? The New York Times could slap a big naked lady on their front page and I'm sure it would increase viewership, but I think we can all agree that doesn't make it better news. And I don't believe journalism is about consumptiongetting the most consumption. If the goal is to just get people to readbuy their articles, there is no incentive to generate good news. Everything will just be tabloids. 2. Every news organization is copying BuzzFeed \"The Washington Post, CNN, Fox News are all scrambling to adopt BuzzFeed's revolutionary model. They can't keep up with BuzzFeed's dominance. They're copying BuzzFeed because it's so good!\" Yea, can't argue there. All these news organizations are copying BuzzFeed. And that hurts journalism. Now all sources are turning to clickbait baloney. BuzzFeed is killing the market because they don't have integrity and are willing to make meaningless posts that are designed to go viral. So now in order to compete, all other news organizations must do the same, which hurts journalism. It is now quite hard to find an unbiased, un-editorialized news source. 3.They do really good pieces \"I'll admit 90 of BuzzFeed is stupid, meaningless posts, but they actually do really good pieces. They've started a whole field of'explanatory news' and really tries to educate a reader. Most news organizations just assume you know all the background of a piece, but most don't. So these pieces really help the public understand current event.\" That's great! They should focus on that then! Just because there are good pieces dotted around the site, doesn't mean it's a good news source. If I see a guy down a steak I'm not going to eat his poop just because there might be some prime rib in there. The New York Times does similar things, where they'll have a 30 page story on something like an avalanche explaining the mountain, back country skiing, the days leading up to it, the backstory to all involved. It's great stuff and they don't have \"17 Pizza's that look like Ohio\" as the next article cued up. I think it's also bad because it gives BuzzFeed credibility. So they can point to the handful of articles and say they're real news when people call them out for their mass quantities of meaningless malarky. 4.They get people to read the news \"Sure, there's a lot of crap, but it gets people reading the news, which traditional media doesn't do. The clickbait gets people reading! You realize it's crap because you're an educated person who goes to a private college, but most people don't. So it doesn't really matter because those people now read the news where they wouldn't have before.\" It's true. People who didn't read the news do now thanks to BuzzFeed. But shouldn't we focus on giving those people an education, teach them to evaluate news sources, give them the tools to discern bias and editorialization? Why are we bringing news down to the lowest common denominator just so more people read it? If we ruin journalism in the process, does it really matter if more people have access to it? Also, I think it's really dangerous to do so because now those who previously didn't read the news have BuzzFeed as their introduction to newsjournalism. Those people who aren't educated or didn't read the news now are much more susceptible to native advertisement. So now there's possibly a whole host of people who think \"This diet pill made these 12 fitness instructors resign because they couldn't compete!\" is real news and not just advertisement for a useless sugar pill. 5.It's a new platform, the next evolution \"You just don't understand this new platform. It's like how print journalism first went on the web. People said the same things you're saying back then but it turned out fine. You just need to realize it's a new age for journalism and you must adapt.\" Print journalism going on the web was just that. Putting the news on the web. It wasn't changing the what people receive or altering news or putting in ads that look like news. It was just giving a new out for people to access news from. I know social media is big and is a powerful tool, but you can use it without making this clickbait nothings. Tweet out the headline with a link, have a'share on facebook' button on the article, post it to reddit. Use the tools to increase access to information, not to destroy it. I'm sure one day well all have personal holograms and that will be a new platform for news. But a hologram of \"3 of the cutest puppies that show black lives matter\" still isn't news. That's the major points I head in defense of BuzzFeed. There were a few more but all under those general points and nothing that CMV. I think the real dangerous part of all this is that all those points I just listed are being taught in journalism classes at renowned institutions. BuzzFeed is now the accepted and taught method for delivering the news. I fear this could be the death of journalism. I always thought \"BuzzFeed is kinda dumb, but hey, if people like looking at silly lists, who am I to say they can't.\" But now these silly lists are being hailed as the height of contemporary journalism! It seems were doomed to editorialized, plagiarized, uninformative clickbait for our news from now on. Anyway, just looking for someone to change my view. I actually would like it if someone changed my view because it would be great to go look at silly lists all day. Seems like a good way to kill time but I don't want to support BuzzFeed.

It seems were doomed to editorialized , plagiarized , uninformative clickbait for our news from now on. Anyway , just looking for mortal to change my view. I actually would like it if someone changed my view because it would be great to choke look at silly lists all day. Seems like a good way to kill clock time but I do n't want to support BuzzFeed.

{"original_text": "Marriage as a word comes from the Middle english word mariage, which according to sources from Wikipedia, comes from around CE. Word comes from another Old French word then to a Latin word maritare, which describes a husband and wife. Adding on top of that, many modern religions using the word to describe the ceremony as a marriage between one man and one woman, I see that the word Marriage is intrinsically religious. Now moving to modern day, Marriage is changing as many people are adding tochanging the meaning to a word that many people use as a religious word. People are getting up in arms about these and I can see their points. Marriage in a lot of religions these days is still defined as one man and one woman. Now have a courtgovernment adding tochanging that definition of that word, this is where I believe the whole issue is. The issue with people not wanting gay marriage based off religious beliefs is because a word is being used for something that it does not mean to them. Marriage isfrom religion and should keep it that way. We need to rename Marriage in the government to remove this part of the issue that the anti-gay marriage community has with it. Now I know it still won't remove the whole problem that the anti-gay community has with gay marriage but I believe it will remove everyone who dislikes that this word, that is so entrenched in religion, is being redefined by a government decision. I even see a huge problem with these, I am not religious and completely for two consenting people getting married, no matter whowhat they are. The government needs to change its vocabulary so that when you want your union to be legal, you go get a Civil Union (Or whatever we call it) from the government. But if you want to get married, you must find a religion that accepts your union. This returns marriage to Religion and I believe removes a huge part of the problems we are having in the acceptance of this practice. [Source of Etymology] HUGE EDIT: So uawa64 and ucptal has brought to my attention some information. The intrinsic nature of the word marriage that I was bringing up has some flaws. The act of marriage seems to have been more of a social thing rather than a religious thing off the bat. The church seemed to basically be the best at keeping records and the sacrament didn't come until later. So even though the nature of the word has been pretty much a religious definition for a while, the word itself is not intrinsically religious. [Here] and [Here] are their sources they brought to me. So with further communications with others, I have been bringing up that society is changing the word marriage and my view is more of a fix to speed up that change at least on the religious vs government front. The word will change in society but that takes a long time. As uGAB104 and a few others pointed out, that religion has change a bit from what it used to be.

{"original_text": "Whenever I see reddit harping on pre-orders I always ask what's so bad about them. No one has ever offered even a half-decent argument about why they're so terrible. [See this most recent thread for an example.] \"But the game might suck.\" The only decent argument I ever hear is that you're putting up money for something you may not like. However, you can easily minimize this risk by doing some research on the games. Nowadays it's not unheard of for a game to be thoroughly reviewed by YouTubers or other folks who usually aren't out to sell you the game. There's tons of news, screenshots, subreddit with speculation and discussion. (eg. Check out rdragonage for all the DA:I info you could want.) It's very easy to get a good idea of what you're buying. Also, this risk is almost completely taken out of the picture if you pre-order games from franchises or companies you know and like (Saints Row, Borderlands, Tomb Raider, etc.) and don't throw money at unknown devs. \"Just buy it when it comes out, after you see the reviews.\" You can usually see many reviews beforehand, or get an idea for the feel of the game with methods in my previous point. So, given that information, if you're fairly certain you're going to buy the game anytime near release there's no reason not to. In fact, there's incentive to do so, given as pre-order bonuses. I've gotten Steam discounts, free DLC, free games, etc., hundreds of dollars worth. \"Wait for it to be cheaper or on sale.\" Admittedly this one's great if you're the type who doesn't need to play something on release. However, for games I truly love, I want to play it quick, when all my friends are also playing, so we can talk about it and I'm not sitting here in 2013 saying \"Hey, you guys heard about that Skyrim game?\" If you're a sale-searcher then, yes, preorders are rarely a good deal. But if you'll be buying near release day you may as well buy before. \"No, but seriously, the game might suck.\" I made the mistake of buying a game without much research once. What was the game? WarZ. And what happened? I requested a refund and was promptly refunded. I believe GameStop has some sort of limited duration full return policy, I know WalMart does. If you are led astray via research it's not a big deal to return the game for a refund in most cases. (I've even received refunds for mistaken, non-pre-order purchases from Steam.) And so, my view, is that anyone who is going to buy a game near release is best off pre-ordering in any situation that you're given free DLC or rewards, which is most big-name titles these days.

{"original_text": "EDIT: Haha the amount of downvotes on this is crazy. Looks like I hit a nerve or something. First, I define \"enthusiastic consent\" the state of consenting to sex not only technically (i.e. saying yes regardless of context) but also with clear demonstration that you are excited and happy about the prospect. It's a big deal in many feminist spaces, most prominently including the feminist subreddits here (ie. twoxchromosomes, raskwomen, rfeminism, etc). A lot of feminists I have spoken to would like to see a society where there's a legal requirement for one party to get enthusiastic consent before doing anything physical with another party. Not getting enthusiastic consent would be, in this ideal society, seen as rape and would lead to criminal charges. This would include cases where the girl either participated and didn't say no, meekly said yes, reluctantly agreed, said yes after saying no a few times, etc. First of all, I strongly disagree with the entire concept of enthusiastic consent because I think it is infantalizing women and denying them agency - basically telling them that when they say \"yes\" it isn't enough, they need to be clearer about it. If a woman is just naturally meek? Tough luck. But that's not the main part of my post. I believe that if we as a society teach our children enthusiastic consent and pressure people to follow it, then it is only logical that we apply the principle to other things besides sex. Why put up sex on a pedestal? Why is sex the only situation where we should expect a person to be excited about what they're doing? Why do we put up sex as such as sacred cow? - If a customer is buying a product, they should have to legally and morally demonstrate enthusiastic consent. If a store owner manages to persuade them of the product's viability and they finally give up and say \"oh, okay, I'll get it\" - then the storeowner should be charged with theft. It's basically a mugging at that point because the customer bought the product reluctantly, right? At the very least, the storeowner should be shamed and ostracized by society for his actions. - Politicians should not be allowed to aggressively campaign and try hard to convince fence-sitting voters to vote for them. That would be considered mental pressure. If a person votes for a politician reluctantly (ie. \"well, he's the least of two evils after being approached repeatedly by that politician's supporters, frequently handed pamphlets, etc - then the politician and hisher supporters should be arrested. After all, the voter was pressured into supporting that politician, right? The voter didn't do so with enthusiasm. A lot of feminists should see this as coercion. These are just two examples of what I honestly believe is a logical continuation of \"enthusiastic consent.\" There is no rational basis for limiting that concept to just sex, if we accept it as a society. To be clear, I don't support such a society. My argument is that the feminists who aggressively spread the concept of enthusiastic consent should logically want to apply it to other areas as well - pretty much any situation where a person is doing something unenthusiastically after being persuaded. Please change my view. TL;DR: Enthusiastic consent, if we accept it as a society, shouldn't be limited to sex. It is only logical to apply it to a variety of other situations, basically anytime someone does something after being mentally pressured. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"original_text": "This type of post has probably already been made a handful of times but I wanted to include some of my own thoughts. I live in the UK, so I have grown up in a country that does provide universal healthcare. I firmly believe in this model from an ethical and social standpoint. I've recently started reading the book Freakonomics. I wanted to see some discussions of the book on reddit, and I came across an AmA of the author, Steven Levitt. Somebody asked him his views on universal healthcare, to which he replied; 'I'm not so sure about universal healthcare. what i think we really need is for people to pay a big chunk of their own health care costs so the whole system starts to act more like a market and less like an entitlement. when health care is 20 of GDP, we can't treat it like an all you can eat buffet.' Now, I'm not ranting or saying I flat out disagree with his statement factually, because I do not know enough about financial economics to do so, but as somebody who believes universal healthcare \"should\" be a human right, or 'entitlement' as Steven Levitt has put it, I struggle to understand how humanity as a whole would benefit from persisting with privatised health care. Essentially, to change my view, I would need to be convinced that privatised health care actually does have longstanding benefits for humanity, and not just for the 'economy'. Perhaps sustaining the economy and longevity of humanity come hand in hand, but I've always felt privatised health care primarily serves the rich who own it, and to deny healthcare to somebody who cannot afford it seems outright inhumane to me. Perhaps somebody could show me privatised healthcare actually does benefit humanity as a whole, and not just a small percentage. EDIT: I was asked to link the post that 'changed my view' the most, so here it is. Here is the post that I awarded a 'delta' quite early on. Admittedly I perhaps could have been more involved in the thread but I was quite literally overwhelmed with the amount of replies, to the point that the same types of responses were pouring through, deeming it almost impossible to identify which further posts would be deserving of another delta. Although my view is not changed in that I still believe as a society we should work towards everybody having 'free' access to basic healthcare, I am now aware of the implications of a 'human right', and how that could have serious adverse effects.

EDIT : I was involve to link the post that 'changed my view ' the most , so here it is. Here is the post that I awarded a 'delta ' quite other on. Admittedly I perhaps could have been more involved in the thread but I was quite literally overwhelmed with the amount of replies , to the point that the same types of responses were pouring through , deeming it almost impossible to identify which further posts would make up deserving of another delta. Although my view is not changed in that I still believe as a society we should work towards everybody having 'free ' access to basic healthcare , I am now aware of the implications of a 'human right ' , and how that could have serious adverse result. I 'm sorry if I was not totally compliant with the rules of the thread , but overall I see it as a success as it made me see things in a different perspective , and perhaps others possess learnt from it as much I possess. Thank you for all of your response. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "The issue of blacks being \"disproportionately affected\" by police violence is simple. Black people have only have civil rights for 50 years or so. Without civil rights it's kind of hard to get a decent job, or get a quality education. This leads to generational poverty. Many white people have at least someone in their family who could bail them out in a financial pinch. Many black people do not have that. Imagine if everyone in your immediate family that you could reach out to for help was just as poor as you. While this is a reality for whites as well, it is a harsh reality for a larger number of blacks. When you have generational poverty, it's a lot harder to break out of poverty yourself, when you have no positive influences and noone to support you while you go to school, or teach you etc. When you are in poverty, you tend to be more desperate and commit more crimes. When you commit more crimes, you tend to interact with the police more. The more desperate you are, the more violent crimes you commit, and the more lethal the response from police. It is true, black people do commit a disproportionate number of crimes compared to white people, but they also are disproportionately poorer, which as I stated leads to desperation. (NOTE: There are more white criminals than black criminals, but only because black people are a minority. Black people are proportionately charged with crimes more than white people) Am I excusing the behavior of criminals? No, I am simply cosigning those that trumpet the \"black crime statistics\" as it is indeed a societal problem, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the color of their skin or genetics, and everything to do with cause and effect over the last 150 years. Am I saying we should feel white guilt? Fuck no, I sure as hell don't. Even the most persecuted members of this country have it far better than the starving people in other countries. It is what it is. The only way out of this mess, in my opinion, is to fund all schools equally. Give an equal share of tax dollars to the rich schools as well as the inner city ones. Then our next generation might have a chance at producing less criminals (of any race). Why does Beverly Hills High need a day spa, when Compton High can't afford working computers? I'm not advocating a re-distribution of wealth, but when it comes to government provided services, they should all be provided equally, especially something as crucial as this. I am absolutely against giving blanket handouts to poor people. I am not a fan of public assistance. Technically though, we are all on the public assistance dole unless you send your kids to private school. If you want to break the cycle of poverty, provide kids of all socioeconomic classes a fair chance. Giving special college grants to people of a specific, disadvantaged race or class is worthless, because at that point they already received an inferior education from their crappy public school, and by letting them into your college with a lower score you are lowering the standard for everyone. Invest all the NAACPaffirmative action college grant BS into public schools instead so they can get into college on their own merit. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"original_text": "This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. This needs to be prefaced by saying that all of this is based on averages, not individuals. I'm sure many women are more capable than many men, what I'm saying is that the general trend across the board is that on average a male worker is more productive. Men work almost triple the amount of overtime hours than women. Men work more standard hours than women. Women take more sick days off work than men. Women are more likely than men to take several years of maternity leave off of work. A small percentage of women undergo severe PMS and consequently work at a diminished capacity for several days of each month. To use anecdotal evidence, yesterday I came in to work, to find that all 8 garbages were completely filled. This was strange, since the closing crew is supposed to take out the garbages every night. I asked my coworker why no one had done the garbages last night, and I was effectively told that only girls were working the closing shift, and none of them wanted to touch the garbages because they thought it was gross. So I had to take out 8 garbages first thing in the morning, because I was a man. Additionally, the parking lot was overflowing with trash that had spilled out of the over-packed garbage cans, but none of the girls had done the usual nightly responsibility of sweeping, since they thought it was a man's job as well. I'm not talking about one or two co-workers here, there were 7 women on shift, and every single one of them followed this gender stereotyped idea of what closing responsibilities they should have. Its one thing if men and women divide tasks based on relative strengths and weaknesses, but if someone neglects to do a task because there's no one of the opposite sex to assign it to, that is ridiculous. When only men are closing, someone still ends up washing the dishes and shining the countertops. Due to the biological, sociological, and psychological factors that women face, they are on average less suited to performing excessive labour, and in an economic system where more work more money, it is no surprise that men make more than women. What I find most surprising is that when I bring up this issue, I am met with incredible opposition, as if I am trying to oppress women or promote sexism. The truth is, an entire branch of feminism exists for the very reasons I have stated; socialist feminism believes that men have a higher capacity to work and are therefore at an advantage in a capitalist society. They believe the only way wage equality can happen is through instating socialist policies that ensure employers are forced to pay men and women equally. I am not saying that women deserve to be paid less because they have children for example, humanity needs new people to be born, and as such women should not be penalized for taking time off work to raise children. However, we do not live in a moral democracy. We live in a capitalist democracy, where employers are free to pay their employees whatever they think is proportional to the revenue or work that each specific employee will bring to the company. On average, certainly not always, but on average, men can generate slightly more work and revenue than women. Thus, the only way women can achieve equal pay is through socialist change in legislation.", "text_perturb": "This is naturally an incredibly controversial theme and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me , but I feel compelled to discuss this.

Due to the biological , sociological , and psychological factors that women face , they are on average less suitable to performing excessive labour , and in an economic system where more work more money , it is no surprise that men make more than women. What I find most surprising is that when I bring up this issue , I am fill with incredible opposition , as if I am trying to oppress women or promote sexism. The truth embody , an entire branch of feminism exists for the very reasons I have stated ; socialist feminism believes that men have a higher capacity to work and are therefore at an advantage in a capitalist society. They believe the only way wage equality can happen is through instating socialist policies that ensure employers are forced to pay up men and women equally. I am not saying that women deserve to be paid less because they have children for example , humanity needs new people to be born , and as such women should not be penalized for postulate time off work to raise children. However , we do not survive in a moral democracy. We live in a capitalist democracy , where employers follow free to pay their employees whatever they think is proportional to the revenue or work that each specific employee will bring to the company. On average , certainly not always , but on average , men can generate slightly more work and gross than women. Thus , the alone way women can achieve equal pay is through socialist change in legislation. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "We've all heard the saying that a Jack of All Trades is a Master of None. I'm not here to say that this is completely true and that if you are good at many things you will never be a \"master\" at some skill or aspect of your life. What I am willing to argue is that benefits of being a Jack of All Trades far outweighs the benefits of being a master of one or few \"trades.\" For starters, the possibility of finding the thing that truly makes you happy and satisfied in life is lessened quite significantly if your endeavors are honed into a certain subject at an early age. The amount of time you spend on a certain skill, hobby, or whatever it may be is inversely related on the amount of time you spend on other aspects of your life. It is my opinion that when you decide on your calling and devote yourself almost entirely to it, you miss out on other precious and interesting opportunities that your life could include otherwise. There is no doubt in my mind that abundant success in life is generated by the willingness to make a sacrifices for the thing that you believe that you want the most. It is up to the individual to decide what matters to them the most. Personally though, I think this is such a misguided approach to life that often leaves people feeling unfulfilled when they approach an advanced age. Is \"success\" in life really that valuable to humans that they are willing to give up so much of their time to a specific task? The need to be recognized and respected as a master of a particular aspect of life is a major driving factor of the sacrifices people make. A Jack of All Trades in my opinion does not mean you have to be great or even good at the things that you try once, or even do on a regular basis. For sanity's sake though, let's just say a Jack of All Trades is \"good\" at many things and a Master is \"great\" at one thing. When you set your focus on being great at one aspect of your life, there is the potential to backseat so many other important things in your life. I think, perhaps, this is best explained with an example. I have a co-worker who is one of the most vocally well-versed, decorated, and revered employees at the company at which I am employed. I am still quite young, and I just graduated college and he is one of my mentors. Working with him has really shown me what true mastery looks like. However, he spends at least 60 hours a week at work for no real reason other than the fact that he is potentially obsessed with his work. At his age, I know for a fact he would rather be spending time with his grand kids; he doesn't view time the same way most others do, and as a result ends up leaving the office at 7 o'clock every night. I try not to work overtime unless we are really running behind on a project, because while I love my job, I don't feel the need to devote myself fully to the task. As a result, I am able to focus on so much else and I am not constantly thinking about one specific thing. The ability to detach myself from my career after I leave the office (or job site) really seems to subconsciously effect the rest of my day. I feel more energized when I workout and I don't mind studying other things or brushing up on languages other than English. I also get the opportunity to socialize more with friends when I leave work on time. Having weekends off means I have the potential to do whatever I want and I can pick up new hobbies along the way. So in short I am sacrificing the potential to be great at one thing for the potential to be good (or maybe even just experience) many other things. Please don't relegate this to being a work-a-holic and not being a work-a-holic. This was purely a life example that directly relates to the topic at hand. I am sure it is possible to be a Master of one or more things and still be good at a lot of other things, but my main point is that a Jack of All Trades is a much more interesting and fulfilling approach to life than dedication to a singular practice. Edit Here is the delta, thanks AnecdotallyExtant I will change your view with a single diagram. It will demonstrate that in order to become a master of one, a person must first become a Jack of all. As an anecdotal example: I am myself somewhere right around the transition between the eighth and ninth picture in that diagram. But I am also the handiest person I know around the house. I can and regularly do fox everything in my house nearly worthless with cars, but the home I'm solid. So again, to become a master of a single trade, one must first become a jack of all. Or one cannot understand his or her own trade out of context. This is why we start our educations in kindergarten and not in graduate studies. A wide, solid, strong and synthetic knowledge base is an absolute a priori necessity. Which means that it can only follow that a master of one is superior, because it includes a thorough training in the jack of all. Please read below if you want to see the diagram.

{"original_text": "Throwaway account, my main is used for school. I'm 28, male, and a grad student (chemistry). I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She frequently brings up marriage and talks about how she believes I'll never propose to her, and I've told her that I'm honestly not sure how I feel about the whole concept of marriage. I would have no problem staying with her for my entire life, but I just don't understand how a ring and a piece of paper makes any difference. Let me outline my preconceptions here: My parents' marriage fell apart due to infidelity and divorce.

{"original_text": "There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a certificate and to celebrate that milestone, and as such should be restricted to University courses, and at a push to cover people at the end of High School (so that the people who go straight into work celebrate an end of their formal education). I appreciate that schools and the pupils want to celebrate the end of their time at that school, but placing children in garishly-coloured robes at the age of 7 only cheapens what a'graduation' stands for. There are other ways they can celebrate a new beginning without appropriating and trampling on existing ceremonies and traditions To give a comparison, consider how engineers in the US and Canada are given an iron ring in a ceremony to symbolise their obligation. The ring and the associated ceremony is a very personal symbol of their choices and achievements to the engineers. Now imagine how they would feel if every single infant school started copying their ceremony word for word, item for item, issuing iron rings to 7 year olds telling them it means the same.

I appreciate that schools and the pupils want to celebrate the end of their time at that school , but invest children in garishly-coloured robes at the age of 7 only cheapens what a'graduation ' stands for. There are other ways they can celebrate a new beginning without earmark and trampling on existing ceremonies and traditions To give a comparison , consider how engineers in the US and Canada are given an iron ring in a ceremony to symbolise their obligation. The ring and the associated ceremonial occasion is a very personal symbol of their choices and achievements to the engineers. Now imagine how they would feel if every single infant school started copying their ceremony word for word , item for item , egress iron rings to 7 year olds telling them it means the same. My son is supposed to have got a'graduation ' in a few months , and the vast majority of the parents are planning a boycott , organising their own event in its place.

{"original_text": "My post is inspired by [this article] in which a major politician proposes allowing college students to sell \"shares\" of their future earnings to investors in exchange for funding their education. I have seen people criticize this system as one of \"indentured servitude,\" presumably because for a period of years students could not be released from the requirement to pay a portion of their earnings to the investor (s). However, the current system of student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, amounting to a lifetime obligation anyway (or longer, if they die early and there are co-signers on the loan). Admittedly, fixed-amount loans are better for students who have unexpectedly high earnings so this system might discourage some risk-taking. But so does the current system for those who want to avoid the down-side unemployment and no long-term relief from student loans. A system of \"shares\" would likely also discourage investors from paying for worthless online degrees, or college amenities that do not advance future earnings. This is a relatively new concept for me, so I'm eager to hear from those who want to change my view, or at least help me refine my understanding of the trade-offs. Thanks for weighing in! Edit 1: Thanks for all the great comments and arguments so far. One delta awarded at this point to uPlexiglassPelican for suggesting it makes better sense to have the payment based on a percentage of income beyond a basic amount that would have come even without a degree. (ungxp has also convincingly argued that existing banks would not likely be the ones to enter this new format, but that doesn't persuade me the format is a bad idea. I think maybe formulaic, risk-averse banks should take a back seat in this arena.) Edit 2: Whoa! So many great comments and thoughts. Many here are presuming (as I admit I did when I first started the thread) that what major you choose would likely be a key factor for investors deciding who to fund. And so many people here are assuming that a share system would be the death of the liberal arts. Although no one has really argued to the contrary, I now think this is a misplaced emphasis. Although it is not central to my view, I'm inclined to think that getting a degree in any major at an ivy league school vs. any major at a local community college is going to be a bigger factor than your major choice within a given school. Also, the share system doesn't have to be a fixed percentage (though probably there is a natural maximum at the point it starts to discourage seeking work). Finally (and relatedly), getting a degree in something doesn't mean that you are compelled to work in that field. So getting an English degree from a second-rate university might wind up costing, say 12 of your earnings (above a certain threshold see edit 1) for the next 30 years, while getting a Math degree from Stanford might wind up costing 3 of your earnings. Edit 3: Thanks to all who participated in this spirited discussion. I'm going to wrap this up with a final delta to uhacksoncode who made clear to me that those who marry and have a spouse support them after college would need to be prepared to commit a portion of their joint income to repay the investor. Most of the rest of the comments at this point seem to be covering the same ground, which I have not found persuasive in my view that the proposed system is better than the student loan system: Investors would find this product more risky than loans, and so it would not fit the business model of banks Stupid people would no longer be able to, literally, mortgage their future to \"dream\" unrealistically Direct taxpayer funding of college might be better than either system. This deal would be better for some people than for others. For those who wind up making higher incomes, it would on average be a worse deal than existing student loans, for those who wind up making lower incomes it would on average be a better deal. Even if I agreed with these things, and mostly I do, they would not change my view. Finally, there has been a lot of discussion premised (and I was guilty of this too, at first) on the notion that your field of study would be a major driver for attracting investors. I'm coming around to the view that except in the case of very specialized programs (e.g. engineering, medicine), field of study won't be as big a factor as student achievement and quality of school overall.

For example, part of why people buy expensive clothescars is to signal to others that they have money, not because those things are inherently more useful.

Good students tend to be smart, hard-working, and conformist - three crucial traits for almost any job.

Some of the arguments I have seen in opposition of gay marriage are : `` homosexuality is a sin '' `` not natural '' `` erodes the sanctity of marriage '' `` slippery slope leading to marriage of `` `` not healthy for children '' `` goes against God '' These all seem to be the like arguments that were presented in the 1950 's and 1960 's when people were fighting for marriage equality between the races. and so why have n't people learned anything about equality over the last 60 years ? edit 1 : The best argument iv seen thus far was by umoonflower when they said `` Racial difference is not the same as sex difference , even if some of the the arguments against them sound similar. `` This isnt an end all statement ; but a heavy point.

{"original_text": "Rock and Roll music is no longer an important part of the cultural conversation. This is obviously not to say that there is no longer rock music being made, that that music is never popular, or that that contemporary rock music isn't good. But rock has become similar to jazz and classical - while there is still lots of it being made, it's not a powerful cultural force any more. The modern cultural conversation is being played out in hip-hop and EDM. Of the current Top 10 on the Billboard charts, the only rock single is \"Shut Up and Dance\" by Walk the Moon, at 9, and that song is heavily influenced by EDM. The current Song of the Summer is generally agreed to be Fetty Wap's \"Trap Queen.\" The most consistently popular rock band currently is probably either the Foo Fighters, a band that has been around since the late 90s and still plays a very similar style of music to what they were playing then (and arguably still owe a large portion of their popularity to nostalgia for Nirvana, a band whose largest cultural moment was 24 years ago), or the Black Keys, a band playing with a deliberately retro style. Tame Impala and Arcade Fire, two bands that have been lauded for their innovation in the rock genre have on their most recent albums embraced EDM influences, and largely moved away from guitar-based rock. I would argue that the most culturally important albums of the past few months have been outside of rock - Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp A Butterfly, Drake's If You're Reading This It's Too Late, Mark Ronson's Uptown Special, Taylor Swift's 1989 (in which she ditched her country roots for an embrace of EDM pop). There has been a lot of rock music recently that has been great too (Father John Misty, Courtney Barnett, Colleen Green, and Jim O'Rourke have all released albums I have absolutely loved, and I just listened to the new Titus Andronicus album yesterday) but that has become an exception, and as my examples point out, it's not really commercially popular or culturally relevant beyond a small core. I don't have a real problem with rock losing its cultural cachet. I love rap, RB, and electronica as well, and think that there is a lot of great innovation going on in modern music (and even that 2015 is an all-time stand-out year).

Even working at Boeing, his primary job was that of a TV persona: he made the training videos. I feel that Obama's use of Nye regarding global warming is strictly an appeal to the populace who grew up watching a kid show, not the opinion of a professional with a background in anything remotely related to climate. This doesn't mean I disagree with what he said, but only disagree with the idea that he should be trusted'as a scientist'. He's a PR tool in that regard. He only parrots others' research - in everything he's done -not anything he actually observed through his own research. Further, simply having a degree in a scientific background makes you aware of that background (he has a bachelor's in engineering from Cornell), but that doesn't make you a scientist in the field. I know many people with degrees in one field who work in an entirely different field. A law degree doesn't make you a lawyer, for instance. My father has one and he's a retired contractor: never worked a legal case in his life. Nye's background hardly applies to the vast majority of his TV demonstrations and appearances.

{"original_text": "Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, for example: 1. My child, my choice. Well, yes. And this is the closest one to a valid argument, IMO. But of course we put limits on what parents are allowed to do and choose for their children; you can't deprive your child of food or education (in the US) and be allowed to keep your child, so clearly it is NOT all your choice. While refusing vaccines is nowhere near on that level, not EVERY possible choice is equally acceptable, because your child is a person, not a piece of property. If the child had the capacity to refuse, I might be swayed, but unfortunately young babies can't understand vaccines on any reasonable level. And, more importantly, it IS still your choice under school vaccination schemes; you can choose to homeschool your child, or send them to private schools that don't care. Those choices aren't available to everyone and that's unfortunate (for far more important reasons than this), but...that's our current system anyway. Being rich gets you all kinds of benefits. I don't think this is different from being able to buy better medical care, better schools, better food, private tutors, and worlds more for your child if you have the resources (I do support basic income, which would alleviate this issue, but that's neither here nor there as we haven't got it). Public schools are a governmental service, and there are rules about who can and cannot use them. I think it is fine to say only vaccinated (or medically exempt) people can use them. 2. Not everyone can get vaccinated. That's why doctors are able to issue waivers for those not medically right for vaccination. This already happens and should continue. 3. Vaccines are dangerous. Not as dangerous as rampant infection. Honestly this is its own debate...But suffice it to say you are going to need some pretty major evidence to possibly CMV. I don't think it exists, but I won't rule it out. I don't really want to talk about vaccine efficacy as it has been done to death, but I guess if there's some truly amazing evidence... 4. Everyone is entitled to an education. They still are. Any unvaccinated child either needs to attend a non-public education option, be homeschooled or eschooled, provide a medical certificate that says they shouldn't be vaccinated, or get the shots. I don't necessarily have a strong view on the best way to handle noncompliance, and don't know enough about policy to say what would be most effective and just. Maybe fines for the parents? The same punishment as parents who refuse to send their kids to school or teach them at home for other reasons? I would not support removing the child from the home or incarcerating the parents, or any other severe punishment. What would change my view: evidence that such a policy would have clear public health risks, would unavoidably keep children from getting an education, or would have some other major negative effect on society. I also am open to the idea that it is fundamentally unjust, though it doesn't seem that way to me right now. Edit: My post focuses mainly on why I think mandatory vaccination isn't bad, but it occurred to me that it might be helpful to say why I think it's good. Mainly, I think it's good because it protects those who cannot be vaccinated and the minority of children for whom the vaccine was ineffective or wore off sooner than it \"should have\" based on medical guidelines. Children should be safe at school, and I think this promotes safety in a significant waysince children can die of preventable illness.

{"original_text": "Alright, 5hrs into this and I have not changed the view expressed in the title but I have conceded most of my original points thanks, in-part, to ubritainfan234. In summary, regardless of how an edit might affect others, that is the right of the comment owner. How people feel about that edit will be reflected in future voting. Now, what I do still stand by is that while you're entitled to edit your comment to say \"thank you\" or whatever you wish, you probably still shouldn't. Here is my new, primary argument: N1.) The reddit gold system is already designed to give you a chance to be thanked, but you knowingly reject this by choosing to send the gift anonymously. As a recipient of anonymous gold, editing your comment might express your appreciation to future readers, but the gilder will NOT be notified of your edit and they most likely will never see it. They rejected their chance to be thanked by checking the anonymous button and there is no remaining obligation on your part. With that, receiving gold feels great! I think our human nature calls for us to always have someone to thank (or blame) for the uncontrollable events in our life. It's a good thing to show your appreciation, but when it comes to reddit gold, there is no obligation to thank someone who has \"opted-out\" and editing your original comment does accomplish its intended effect. If you're just getting here, you can skip the rest of this post and go directly to the comments section. If you're interested in my original discussion (which includes edits at the bottom), I was just wanting to keep that available. [BEGIN ORIGINAL POST] I think it's wonderful that reddit allows you to edit your comments. Valid reasons to edit might be include adding additional information, clarifying certain points, or simply fixing typos. In an ideal world, reddit would show the revision history for edited comments (perhaps while performing a mouse-over on the asterisk? Hint, hint, reddit!). Since we don't have this feature, editing can sometimes lead to confusion or frustration. The ambiguity of the asterisk can mean critical parts of a comment were added or removed and perhaps the entire commentmessage was changed. It's slightly unsettling to not know how a post was modified, but when it's a gilded comment, that desire to see the original message is even stronger. To help organize things, here are my main objections to this practice: 1.) Once an edit has been made, there is no way to guarantee you're seeing the original message. This obviously applies to any post on reddit, but gilded posts especially are meant to catch the eye so this tends to give them a little more weight in a conversation. Since gilded posts attract more attention, I think preserving their original message is even more important. Adding \"thanks\" to a gilded comment isn't a good reason to invoke the edited flagasterisk. 2.) It detracts from the message. A witty one-liner is always made better with gold. Writing up a thank you message to the end adds bloat to an otherwise concise comment and arguably takes away from the humor as well. I've seen thank you messages longer that the original comment. Something about that just doesn't seem right... 3.) A conversation on reddit is typically comprised of a number of comments. Adding personal messages interrupts the overall flow. I often think of the various replies to a comment as contenders fighting for conversational focus. Whoever makes the best point gets upvoted to the top and that becomes the primary direction a conversation flows. The point here is that we read through comments and comment-replies as if they were one extended conversation. Adding personal messages to any one of the comments in the chain hinders the overall readability of the big-picture conversation. 4.) There is a better alternative. When giving gold, you're presented with the option to remain anonymous. Choosing to be anonymous means choosing to not be recognized. To edit your post is to go against the gilder's wishes. On the other hand, a person can deselect that option and then you'll be able to reply directly to them! In summary, there should never be a reason to edit your post for thank yous. The system is designed to give the gilder the option to receive recognition and it really should be their say, not yours. 5.) A \"thank you\" edit will most likely never reach the eyes of the gilder anyway, it only affects future readers. After giving gold, you most likely venture off elsewhere on reddit. There are no notifications that a gilded comment changed and in all likelihood you probably won't see that comment again. Sure, a person can always go back and look at the gildings they've given, but I doubt many people go out of their way to do this JUST to see if someone thanked them. As stated in point 4, the gilder already has a mechanism to receive thanks. If they chose to remain anonymous then go back to look for your \"thanks,\" it's a stupid game they're playing. There's no reason to cater to these people. Tl;dr: Editing posts can mean a number of things and creating that uncertainty just to say \"thanks\" is an improper use of the feature. I think the fact that the gold-giving system allows the gilder to select their anonymity puts the power in their hands. If someone chooses to be anonymous, they don't care about recognition and you should respect that. If they don't choose to be anoynmous, reddit provides you with a means to say thank you directly! No comment edits necessary! EDIT: Okay, so it's only fair I address the elephant in the room. Some funny-guy decided to gild this post. Part of me is tempted to strike-out everything above and shout \"THANKS FOR THE GOLD!\" but I gotta stick to my guns, lol. Thankfully, they did not choose to be anonymous so I was able to thank them properly:) In any case, being my first gold, I feel I should be open about my new perspective (which is the reason why I've edited this!). I hate to think I was just jealous and butt-hurt before (I think there's still more substance to the debate than that:-P), but damn it feels great and you really do want to praise whoever did it! The fact that the person giving the gold is able to dictate their anonymity still makes me believe it should be their call, though. EDIT 2: One final point I'd like to make is this: 6.) The purpose of reddit gold (outside of site sustainability), is not for any individual to be recognized, but for the comment itself to be recognized. This is why I'm so dead-set on preserving the original post. I think each viewer should be able to experience the same impact a comment had before it was gilded. It all boils down to the view that \"thank you\" messages are non-value-added fluff. I agree it's a nice gesture, but as I've already covered, that is clearly not something the gilder is worried about if they choose anonymity. I'm sure some people are rolling their eyes at me editing this post, but to me \"valid edits\" are all about adding value. Maybe someone can earn a quick delta by showing me how all \"value\" is subjective to the individual anyway: To some, perhaps a \"thank you\" is value added. I can't argue that!
