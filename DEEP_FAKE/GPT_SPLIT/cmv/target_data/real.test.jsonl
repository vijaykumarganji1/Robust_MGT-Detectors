{"original_text": "First, let me clarify by saying I don't support actual, intentional bashing of any kind, however: We see jokes about it (especially on Reddit) all the time: political correctness is reaching a ludicrous level in our everyday society. It is getting to the point where you can't even make jokes or off-hand remarks without being considered rude, distasteful, ignorant, what ever. I think this is not only not really helpful to a person or group of persons who are facing adversity, it is detrimental. It causes issues that could be making actual progress to falter and nit-pick all of the tiniest little problems they can find rather than strive for real change. It is inadvertently focussing on the negativity in society rather than trying to find a positive solution. It is my opinion that the only way to get past adversity in life is to toughen up and become immune to it and push your way through it. Real change comes about because of real actions. This post was inspired by the earlier discussion on the use of the word \"cisgendered\" and wether it is \"normal\" or wether we should then be differentiating the difference between diabetics and nondiabetics and so forth. I don't think this is a helpful debate overall. sure, if you are asking what gender someone is, it is okay, even good, to distinguish, but all I keep seeing around here, and in real life, and at an increasing rate, is how we all need to check our privilege and be more and more sympathetic; how white people can't relate to minority problems, men can't relate to women's suffrage, cisgendered people can't really understand what transgendered people go through... it just keeps getting more and more specific, and in my opinion, its just focussing everyone's attention on what is wrong with the world, and doesn't actually help us make it better. Adversity is everywhere, it hits everyone. I may be a man, but maybe my dad sexually abused me and locked me in the basement my whole childhood. That girl may be white, but maybe she was raised in a seedy part of town with a drug addicted prostitute mother. Maybe that guy is a straight white male from a nice neighborhood, but he was somehow infected with HIV and now he has AIDS. My point is, none of those people are going to get through their hardships by focussing on those things they can't change, doing so would only hinder their own growth. I can't help but think the same thing when I hear about someone getting upset about someone else using language they find to be offensive. Again, I'm not saying bullying is okay, but the line between what is considered okay to joke about, and what is borderline a hate crime seems to be getting thinner and thinner. In my eyes, trying to further political correctness is only babying everyone and hindering actual growth. TL;DR There is no relative degree of suffering, everyone has a hard life, and trying to force everyone to walk on eggshells all the time doesn't help anyone make their life better. I hope you don't think I'm terrible for thinking this way, and I would love to hear everyone's input. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"original_text": "I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was pretty annoyed to discover that [aspects of the film's plot were warped for the purpose of making it more dramatic] . I do not think any good comes of this, and to be honest it makes me quite mad. For example, in the film, the main character Alan Turing is portrayed by the actor as obviously autistic to some extent, but according to a quote on Wikipedia (not sure exactly who said it) \"the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film.... bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing.\" This, I think, is insulting to Turing's memory, to customise his personality as to make the film more interesting or to make the audience more sympathetic towards his character. Sometimes it's less minor than character modification. I distinctly remember watching 13 Days (2000) in a high school history class to supplement our Cold War study. This film ramped up the'Soviets are evil and JFK is a god' theme to the point of including an entirely fictional battle scene, but went out of its way to present itself as a historically accurate film, including real Cold War footage throughout. We watched it in history class for god's sake! It's also been criticised for attributing a major role in the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis to Kenneth O'Donnell - somebody who was actually there argues that \"For God's sakes, Kenny O'Donnell didn't have any role whatsoever.... that's absurd.\" I think overblowing or underplaying real people's roles in history is just insulting, and cannot be justified. Thus, I am suggesting that films which are'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred. I will pre-argue some anticipated arguments in advance: \"They're claiming to be based on a true story, not perfectly historically accurate.\" Yes, but these films spread misinformation all the same. People take'based on truth' to mean'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films appear as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dateseventsquotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can). It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun. \"The aim of a film is to entertain, it is not meant to be a history lesson.\" But to some extent, they are taken as such all the same. A person who knows absolutely nothing about JFK will undoubtedly feel at least somewhat more knowledgable after sitting down and watching JFK (1991). And you know what, they should feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong. \"It would be boring if we saw films about the events as they actually happened.\" Suck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary. If you want action, watch Avengers. Don't ever watch Pearl Harbour (2001). A quote from Wikipedia regarding that film:'the producer Jerry Bruckheimer was quoted saying, \"We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson. This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly? Okay, I think I've ranted (more than) enough.

It 's also been knock for attributing a major role in the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis to Kenneth O'Donnell - somebody who was actually there argues that `` For God 's sakes , Kenny O'Donnell did n't have any role whatsoever. . . . that 's absurd. `` I think overblowing or underplaying real people 's roles in history is just insulting , and can not be vindicate. Thus , I am suggesting that films which are'based on a true story ' should not be produced , unless historians can guarantee that they constitute a valid representation of what actually occurred. I will pre-argue some anticipated arguments in advance : `` They 're claiming to comprise based on a true story , not perfectly historically accurate. `` Yes , but these films circularise misinformation all the same. People take'based on truth ' to mean'mostly truth ' , especially when filmmakers go to an endeavour to make their films appear as historically accurate as possible ( eg. including real dateseventsquotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they give the sack ). It should not be the audience 's task to understand up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun. `` The aim of a film is to entertain , it is not meant to be a history deterrent example. `` But to some extent , they are contain as such all the same. A person who knows absolutely nothing about JFK will doubtlessly feel at least somewhat more knowledgable after sitting down and watching JFK ( 1991 ). And you know what , they should feel more knowledgable , because parts of the celluloid are correct.

However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons: First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were \"more equal than the others.\" Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people's inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. Second of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it. If for example say USA will start implementing even minor socialists norms, then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers of USA and take away their jobs. Which is indeed the case with things like outsourcing and not so quickly growing USA economy. The solution for USA would then be to close itself up and live in a world where there are no imports or exports, this would protect its citizens from fierce external competition, but leave USA lacking behind in progress of all kinds.

{"original_text": "A couple of quick notes: I am going to use the term \"believe in evolution\" simply for convenience. Evolutionary theory is generally not considered something that you believe in, but since some Christians deny evolutionary theory they effectively don't believe in it. Also, I am going to be using Christianity as my reference religion, but other Abrahamic religions that contain the genesis story are applicable as well. The theory of evolution that gives an explanation as to our origins I believe is not compatible with Christianity. You cannot believe in evolution as well as the Christian genesis story because they directly contradict each other. The Christian genesis story states that god created man in his current form, while evolutionary theory explains that life took millions of years to evolve and that our species is descended from a common ancestor with the other primates. If you are a Christian who believes in evolution as opposed to the genesis story and claim that the Christian genesis is just a metaphor, you open the door for the entire rest of the bible to be just a metaphor as well. Beyond that, if you claim that Christian genesis is just a metaphor because it isn't actually true in a literal sense, then you can further extend that the entire bible isn't true in a literal sense. If someone were to claim that only the genesis story is a metaphor but the rest is literally true, then that person has effectively filtered the bible themselves. For a person to pick and choose what is real and what is not in a sacred book is to not hold the book sacred. Finally, for a person to not hold the bible sacred is to not be a Christian.

The theory of evolution that gives an explanation as to our origins I trust is not compatible with Christianity. You fire not believe in evolution as well as the Christian genesis story because they directly contradict each other. The Christian genesis story states that god created man in his current form , while evolutionary theory explains that life took millions of years to evolve and that our species is descended from a common antecedent with the other primates. If you are a Christian who believes in evolution as opposed to the genesis story and claim that the Christian genesis is merely a metaphor , you open the door for the entire rest of the bible to be merely a metaphor as well. Beyond that , if you claim that Christian genesis is just a metaphor because it is n't actually true in a literal sense , then you dismiss further extend that the entire bible is n't true in a literal sense. If someone were to claim that only the genesis story is a metaphor but the rest is literally true , then that person has effectively permeate the bible themselves. For a person to pick and choose what is real and what is not in a sanctified book is to not hold the book sacred. Finally , for a individual to not hold the bible sacred is to not be a Christian. Evolutionary theory and Christianity are not compatible. cytomegalovirus ! Hello , users of cytomegalovirus ! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"original_text": "The title mentions specifically a tattoo on the forearm, but the underlying premise of my argument is based on a tattoo which would not be visible in formal clothing (such as slacks and a button down) but would be visible in casual wear (shorts and T-shirt). Such a tattoo would not affect chances of college acceptance for three reasons; the ubiquity of tattoos amongst college-aged individuals, the relative unimportance of personal image in the college acceptance process, and the low chance of anyone even seeing the tattoo. According to a Pew Research Centre report, nearly 38 of college-aged individuals have a tattoo. While that is not a majority by quite a margin, it is a significant amount. Additionally, the popularity and accessibility of tattoos are steadily increasing year by year leading to a greater acceptance amongst a younger crowd. The point here is that because of their widespread nature, tattoos are no longer seen as a sign of rebellion simply because they are so commonplace. Furthermore, most colleges prefer to accept or deny students based on their applications alone, rather than on interviews. Unlike a job interview, in which personal image can make or break someone's chances of getting employment, colleges tend to focus more on scholastic and athletic merit, test scores, and lifetime achievements first. Personal image is last on the docket for a school good enough to conduct personal interviews, if even considered at all. The previous two points also assume that a college will know about this tattoo, whereas that may not even be the case.

If the tattoo is exposed after acceptance, then there is no risk of a college retroactively denying admission based on that alone. This third point is also the keystone argument when it comes to employment. For the sake of this argument, I will assume that if an employer knows about any sort of tattoo, it will result in immediately being passed over for the job. This is not consistent with reality and the first two points I make concerning college can be applied to employment as well; tattoos are slowly gaining acceptance in the workforce as the 38 of college students with tattoos graduate and seek employment, and that employers will seek to hire the most qualified candidate with less emphasis placed on personal image. But even discarding these arguments, the possibility of an employer finding out about a tattoo covered by conservative formal clothing in professional situations is nil.

{"original_text": "I am strictly a PC gamer. I own an XBox controller for my PC and am very interested in the upcoming Steam controller. But I'm hesitant to make the purchase, as I barely use my XBox controller. I have tried several times to get used to playing with a controller - even reinstalling old games and starting with the controller to familiarize myself - and I always go back to'mouse and keyboard'. Below are the reasons I think'mouse and keyboard' is the best way to play PC games (really: any game, but KM is really only an option on the PC). The mouse is infinitely more precise than a controller. I can't even imagine playing FPS games with a controller (mostly, I've been playing 3rd-person action games a la Arkham and Tomb Raider). I know many FPS games use an aim assist system to compensate for the imprecision of a controller. I would rather have a more precise input system than an'assist' to compensate for the imprecision of my input device. Because we use them all the time, a keyboard is intuitive. Most of us use computer keyboards and mice on a daily basis in our work. Every QWERTY keyboard has the same layout. When a game tells me'press X', I know exactly where X is. Even people who are very familiar with controller layouts haven't spent nearly as much time with that controller as they have with a keyboard and mouse. Keyboard and mouse work for all games. As I mentioned, I prefer the precision of KM for FPS games. But I'm also a big-time RTS and strategy gamer (Total War are my favorite games) and there's no way I could imagine playing strategy games with a controller. KM works for everything. I even preferred Dark Souls with a KM - a game that many will say is only playable with a controller. I am perfectly comfortable in my computer chair. One of the big advantages I often hear about controllers is the ability to play from the couch. I prefer to be close to my display (I play on a 32in TV and sit about 3 feet back). My keyboard and mouse sit on a laptop desk and my computer chair is very comfortable. I feel more engaged in my games at the distance I sit vs. sitting on the couch. Why I want my view changed: I think the Steam controller looks really cool, but I'm not sure I'd use it. I don't want to make a purchase I won't use. Am I missing out on good experiences that only a controller can offer? I've got a device I barely use. I would like to use it more, if there are games in which using it would give me a better experience. Edit: many good suggestions in this thread so far. I'm going to spend a few minutes playing some of the types of games mentioned (stealth, action, driving, etc.) and see if the controller enhances the experience. Edit 2: Hey everyone. Thanks so much for the discussion. Lots of good points made, but I think the best was made by ustoopydumbut, who suggested that using a controller adds an additional level of challenge. Props, also, to all the users who pointed out the genres of games (racing, fighting, flight sims) that I don't play, but benefit from a controller. I am going to make it point to use my controller as often as I can going forward, and am still considering a Steam controller purchase. Thanks, everyone, this was exactly the conversation I wanted to have. Please feel free to keep posting, if you have something new to add. I will keep reading, commenting, and awarding deltas.

{"original_text": "The US has several interests in the South China Sea. There is regular economic transport through the region, and they have several allies whose national defense and economics are based on their presence in certain regions of the SCS.

{"original_text": "Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for \"sleeping around,\" and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour. I want to make this point clear - I am NOT debating whether or not it is goodbad when a woman engages in behavior that is typically defined under the scope of \"slut.\" That is another argument altogether. I am only asserting that the difference in reaction the majority of people have when they hear about the sexual exploits of either gender is, in general, justified. The reason for this, of course, is biological. It is generally imperative for males to propagate their DNA throughout many different potential mates as possible, to ensure the survival of his line. Historically, however, females had to be more restrictive with who they engage in intercourse with, because they were then strapped with the burden of taking care ofraising a child as a product of the encounter. The brains, hormone profiles, and physiology are disparate between the genders to reflect, in part, these differences in motivation. Given these differences, the crux of my argument boils down to this: it is simply more difficult for a heterosexual man to attain sex, than a woman, ceterus paribus. Once again, to be very clear, I'm not making any moral claims about being a slut; I'm simply stating the difference in difficulty in accomplishing the same task, and the justification of the subsequent reaction. To illustrate this point, I would like to I highlight the scenario of Bob. Bob built a business from the ground up; through sheer hard work and determination, he came from nothing, and now runs a company of hundreds of employees, making millions in revenue. Now, here is Patrick. Patrick also has a company of hundreds of employees, making million dollars in revenue, through his hard work and determination. The difference between Bob and Patrick is this - Bob had absolutely zero dollars in his bank account when he started his business, while Patrick inherited over 5 billion from his father's trust fund. So, even though both have technically accomplished the same thing, it would be fair to say that Bob deserves higher praise. The difference being, of course, while the task itself was the same, the difficulty level of either party to achieveaccomplish this task is significantly different. In the same way, we can assert that (all things being equal) it is much more difficult for a man to sleep with many women, than the reverse. Now, anticipating potential rebuttals, I would like to highlight other scenarios using the same logic above: I believe that heterosexual men (and homosexual women) deserve more praise than homosexual men for the same acts. To what degree, I'm honestly not sure, as I'm not an expert in biologysociology of this kind, but using the biological argument for the difficulty of the task, I would say that homosexual men hooking up is generally easier than the other scenarios.

{"original_text": "Yes I'm an American male, and I don't know how things differ for women or those outside the United States, so I'll leave those two large groups out of the discussion. For any given American male, I believe the chances are less (possibly way less) than 50 that he will at some point in his life have a sexual encounter that truly fulfills his fantasies. I think this is due to a combination of factors, that when taken together hurt his chances greatly: 1) Most mainstream media (movies, TV, magazines, websites, porn, etc.) focuses on very attractive women (and men). Most people (maybe 80-90) don't get anywhere near those standards. Yet the media offers what becomes, in many cases, the yardstick by which we judge attractiveness. This means the pool of attractive potential partners becomes smaller both for the guy and for those he has an interest in. 2) Many if not most men watch porn, and a lot (though certainly not all) of it glorifies unrealistic or demeaning things done to (generally) attractive people who are paid to do it and to act like they enjoy it whether they really do or not. A ludicrous amount of free porn is available to most people, usually from a young age, and much easier to access than an actual partner. 3) Lots of food, sedentary lifestyles, increasing obesity. This ties in with 1, in that we're taught that obesity is unattractive, yet people are getting fatter because of.... lots of things, but we'll just say food is a business that's very heavily marketed to us, and usually not to keep people in good physical form. I think this is a recipe for fat, porn-addicted dudes who dream of boning the hottest of the hot in ways that most self-respecting people would refuse. I'm sure some guys are lucky enough to have a truly gratifying experience with another person, but I think the majority will have to settle for something less than what they dream of. I think that's hard to argue against but also really depressing, so change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"original_text": "Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women in positions of power - increase the number of women that are firefighters or police I can't help feeling that it is a rather useless cause. I have no problem at all with there being less women than men in any place. What I would (and do) have a problem with is women having it more difficult than men to enter certain professions. That is the real problem we should, as a society, try to solve. The current approach is \"forcing\" the proportion of women to increase, by means of: - gender-specific student grants, - positions reserved for women, - lower physical requirements, - etc. As I see it this kind of solutions are problematic in two ways: - They involve so-called \"positive discrimination,\" which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman. This is absurd and can increase animosity in the male coworkers. Admittedly, that would be wrong on their part, but it still can create an hostile work environment. - They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. The only benefits I see is that \"artificially\" increasing the number of women in certain places may make the presence of women in said place appear less \"unusual\" to society, thereby decreasing the discrimination, but I still think they do more harm than good. Reddit, change my view! PD: English is not my first language, so I apologize for any awkwardly phrased sentence I may have written, and welcome any correction. EDIT: In only a few hours there have been a lot of great answers that have confirmed my feeling that this was a more nuanced issue that I could even imagine. My view has been changed in that I had underestimated the benefits of this kind of measures. In particular I now see that: - Artificially increasing the number of women in certain fields makes said fields much less \"threatening\" to other women. - Makes male coworkers appreciate the capabilities of women, decreasing further discrimination. - Improves the selection process by eliminating male-favoring biases. Whenever a man less prepared than a woman would have got the position by conscious or unconscious biases a well-prepared woman will get it. I remain unconvinced that physical tests should have easier versions for women. Most people seemed to agree with me on this, though.

Left-wing views seem to pretty much say that everyone should look after each other. Everyone should do what they are able to and share their skills and resources. That means people who are able to do a lot will support those who can't (e.g. those who are ill, elderly, disabled). The result is that everyone is able to survive happilyhealthily and with equal resources from sharing. Right-wing views seem to pretty much say that everyone is in it for themself. Everyone should be'allowed' to get rich by exploiting others, because everyone has the same opportunities to do that. People that are successful in exploiting othersgetting richetc are just those who have worked the hardest. It then follows that people who are unable to do those things - for example, because they are ill or disabled - should not be helped. Instead, they should \"just try harder\" or \"just get better,\" or at worst \"just die and remove themselves from the gene pool.\" When right-wing people are worried about left-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be allowed to make as much money, or that their money will be taken away.

Most people are basically selfish anyway, but most people also want to do what is right for everyone in their own opinion. Right-wing people (largely) do not actually think that people who can't care for themselves shouldn't be helped. They just believe that private organisations (rather than the government) should be responsible for providing that help. They may be of the opinion that private organisations are more efficient, cheaper, fairer, or better at it than the government in various ways. Right-wing people believe that individuals should have the choice to use their money to help others (by giving to charitable organisations), rather than be forced into it by the government.

{"original_text": "Cigarettes are the leading cause of preventable death, responsible for roughly 480,000 deaths per year in the US. 41,000 of those deaths aren't even those of users they are the deaths of those exposed to secondhand smoke. If you use the drug (nicotine), it can directly affect the health of those close to you. Smoking harms nearly every organ in the body, causing cancer and disease. Cigarettes are extremely addictive and many people can't quit even if they try. Yet other drugs pose less threats and have a much lower or even a nonexistent fatality rate. They certainly aren't killing 1,300 people per day. Can you imagine if an illegal drug killed over 1,000 people everyday, users and nonusers? There would be political crusades. For all illicit drugs combined, the number of resulting deaths were about 17,000 in 2013. For all drugs combined legal and illegal that number jumped to about 46,500 for that same year. That's an extra 29,500 deaths from legal drugs. Cigarettes cause 10x more deaths per year than all the drugs in the US. Why are we pouring so much time, resources and money into the Drug War to keep these super dangerous illegal drugs out of the hands of the American public such as marijuana (easy argument, 0 deaths) or even heroin (much more difficult argument, 6,000 deaths in 2013) when cigarettes are so acceptable? Cigarettes kill nearly half a million people per year and are the direct cause for serious health issues and reduced lifespan. They are highly addictive. If the objective of the War on Drugs is to keep people safe and not addicted to drugs, how can we rationalize this continuing support of cigarettes while stigmatizing the use of other, less harmful drugs? - - - Reasons I think we overlook this high fatality rate... culture and ingrained public perception of acceptance. Cigarettes used to be advertised as good for you and everybody knows somebody who smokes. Smoking is not something you necessarily have to hide. Jobs don't (generally) screen for cigarette smokers. in the eyes of the public, cigarettes aren't really \"drugs\" (i.e. they don't alter your state of consciousness; they don't get you high) An 18 year old can legally buy as many packs of cigarettes as they want. In the US, they can't even do that with alcohol (which gets you drunk). In states with legal marijuana, you also have to be 21 to buyconsume. cigarettes don't cause immediate death.

Sources [X] [X]", "text_perturb": "Cigarettes are the leading cause of preventable dying , responsible for roughly 480,000 deaths per year in the US. 41,000 of those deaths are n't even those of user they are the deaths of those exposed to secondhand smoke. If you use the drug ( nicotine ) , it can straight off affect the health of those close to you. Smoking hurt nearly every organ in the body , causing cancer and disease. Cigarettes are highly addictive and many people ca n't quit even if they try. Yet other drugs pose less menace and have a much lower or even a nonexistent fatality rate. They certainly are n't killing 1,300 citizenry per day. Can you imagine if an illegal drug killed over 1,000 people mundane , users and nonusers ? There would be political crusades. For all illicit drugs combined , the issue of resulting deaths were about 17,000 in 2013. For all drugs combined legal and illegal that number jumped to about 46,500 for that like year. That 's an extra 29,500 expiry from legal drugs. cigarette cause 10x more deaths per year than all the drugs in the US. Why are we pouring so much time , resources and money into the Drug War to keep these super dangerous illegal drugs out of the hands of the American public such as marijuana ( easy argument , 0 deaths ) or even heroin ( a great deal more difficult argument , 6,000 deaths in 2013 ) when cigarettes are so acceptable ? Cigarettes kill nearly half a million people per year and are the direct cause for serious health issues and reduced lifespan. They are extremely addictive. If the objective of the War on Drugs is to keep people safe and not addicted to drug , how can we rationalize this continuing support of cigarettes while stigmatizing the use of other , less harmful drug ? - - - Reasons I think we overlook this high fatality rate. . . culture and deep seated public perception of acceptance. Cigarettes used to be advertised as good for you and everybody eff somebody who smokes. Smoking be not something you necessarily have to hide.

In the US , they ca n't even do that with alcohol ( which get down you drunk ). In state department with legal marijuana , you also have to be 21 to buyconsume. fag do n't cause immediate death. ( shortsightedness ) You cause n't overdose on nicotine. Instead , cigarettes slow kill you so there is no instant connection between cigarettes and death.

{"original_text": "First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that even many of the violent criminals who are jailed don't need to be locked up for as long to prevent them from being an immediate or persistent threat. In fact, I believe that long term incarceration under harsh conditions is something which actually causes further social harm - directly to the person incarcerated and to the society which the prisoner will be released into after an extended period of incarceration. Also, if the person has dependents, they too might suffer more if their material needs are not adequately provided for. Subsequently, if some sort of punishment is required for violating some sort of socially accepted institution, then I feel that some form of shaming, shunning, and exile are possibly effective alternatives to prevent crime before we decide to incarcerate someone for an extended period of time or issue fines which they may not be able to pay. One advantage to this approach is that the punishment is more directly democratic. It's not a punishment which is wholly issued by a sitting judge who is appointed to represent the public and who arbitrarily decides a perpetrator's fate. Rather, the perpetrator, by agreeing to make public their offense, can still receive a certain degree of sympathy and forgiveness. And if they are shunned or exiled (for some indeterminate amount of time), then other members of the public can go along with that punishment to a degree they see fit. Granted, with shunning or exile the punishment would work much better with social cohesion, but if it were the accepted form of punishment then shunning or exile might be more readily accepted and enforced by the general population of an area. Admittedly, this is an aspect of society which would probably have to be reformed or evolve if a society chose to move away from incarceration, corporal punishment, and excessive fines. But if society is incapable of changing in this way.... then I'm not sure society would be able to change in other ways which would make it sustainable and tolerable to live within.

To base the pronunciation of a scripture on an exception is highly illogical. `` The lexicon says both pronunciations are fine ! '' The lexicon also says that'literally ' means both literally and not literally. See ; [ here ]. This make up because the dictionary typically reflects how words are used , not what make up correct. So if people started pronouncing epitome like its spelled , the dictionary would likewise likely say that the incorrect pronunciation is fine there , too. This does not , however , make the orthoepy correct. So without further ado , Change My View ! Edit : For future commenters , I will be arguing only at the grammatical layer from here on out , as I have seen the same arguments from a common usage standpoint enough , and have already awarded several deltas in that category.

[Ken White at Popehat describes how:] Here's how it works. The feds identify some fact that they can prove. It need not be inherently incriminating; it might be whether you were at a particular meeting, or whether you talked to someone about the existence of the investigation.

You - having already been foolhardy enough to talk to them without a lawyer - obligingly lie about this fact. Then, even though there was never any question about the fact, even though your lie did not deter the federal government for a microsecond, they have you nailed for a false statement to a government agent in violation of 18 USC 1001. To be a crime under Section 1001, a statement must be material - but the federal courts have generally supported the government's position that the question is not whether a false statement actually did influence the government, but whether it was the sort of false statement that could have influenced the government. Hence, the government's chickenshit false statement trap works - even though the government agents set it up from the start. Now, however weak or strong their evidence is of the issue they are investigating, they've got you on a Section 1001 charge - a federal felony.

{"original_text": "I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing by buying the product for 1 cent cheaper. It doesn't really add up for that much, and it is outweighed for how much extra the consumer spends due to being misled. Stores wouldn't do it otherwise. I would find it hard to believe that the prices are caused by competition and market equilibrium (i.e. that it would be rationally cheaper to buy at the 599.99 store than the 600 store). It would be a huge coincidence if it turned out that the \"real market price\" just happened to stop at that arbitrary.99 point. Furthermore, it appears that monopolies such as airport snack shops are doing it as well, and they have no competition. Therefore, I argue that it has no benefit to the consumer and it is done in bad faith. Of course, the consumer ought to be responsible when buying, but a practice like this very intentionally exploits such moments of minor inattention. This gives it grounds to be banned. I can see how that might cause problems with prices like 19,900, but not with anything below one dollar difference. If you are a laissez-faire fellow such as myself who might believe that it is the store's natural right to set whatever price it wants for whatever reason, then fine, although it would be very low on the priority list of excessive regulations. But it would at least call for some sort of consumer action or boycott.

Darth Vader is always seen as the ultimate badass. A tall powerful Sith lord with an awesome personal ship and his own Star Destroyer. He is the epitome of an intergalactic villain. However, I'd say that according to the traditional Sith myths (including the Bane and post-Bane era), he was the least influential and least \"Sith\" out of everyone. Every memorable Sith lord before him had some kind of ambition that lead them to where they were. Bane created the rule of 2 and started building a vast informationmoney network for generations to come. He also restored a ton of old Sith lore and knowledge. Plagueis learned how to bring people back to life and used his power to manipulate Palpatine into Chancellorship. Sidious..well, he created the Empire. Vader on the other hand is a manipulated victim of his circumstances and while he did strike fear into the hearts of the citizens of the Empire, he didn't contribute much as a Sith lord. He didn't expand the Sith rule, nor did he learn anything new, nor did he have any drive whatsoever to do anything. When Vader originally turned, it was partially because he wanted to have power like Plagueis (to restore the newly dead and prolong life) but he immediately dropped it after his beloved's death.

The transaction was complete and she had control. If the coffee had been spilled during the handover I would view it the other way around. There are two arguments that I reject. I reject that the severity of the injury affects the responsibility. Comments such as \"have you seen those injuries, they're horrific, she had to be reconstructed\" are common. This is true, they were appalling injuries. But I think this is a strawman argument because my point is that it was not McDonald's responsibility after the handover, not that the injuries were minor. I reject that the coffee was too hot. These are hot drinks. It's obvious to me, and I would hope anyone who intends to drink such a drink that it would be hot and care should be given. Perhaps my culture views it differently. I grew up in England, and here 9 and ten year olds make tea for themselves; kettles boil water and then that water is poured into a teapot cup. We know from a young age that this is dangerous and extreme care must be taken when handling such hot water. Indeed, in a similar UK case against McDonald's regarding hot coffee, the judge ruled that McDonald's was not responsible, one of the reasons being that people expect hot drinks to be hot and should make reasonable safety measures themselves. I do not believe Americans don't realise hot water is dangerous. If anyone would like to comment, I'd be happy to elaborate further. I look forward to having interesting discussion.

I would find this argument much more convincing if Uber weren't exempt from almost every rule and regulation by which the TLC governs traditional taxi services, on dubious legal grounds. Yellow (and green) cabs in NYC must comply with many rules, including car safety inspections, emissions checks and other environmental regulations, and driver background checks.

{"original_text": "A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a Uzi submachine gun on full automatic. From some comments various people have left on this and the reporting it seems that it is not unusual for kids even younger then that to shoot real firearms. This is ridiculous. Children (and I define that in this case as everyone under 18) are not nearly responsible enough to handle them. There is a reason we do not let little children drive cars or drink alcohol etc. Childrens Brains (and even young adult's, but you have to draw the line somewhere) are still in the process of developing. We all have done stupid shit as children. Hell, just here on reddit I read about some guy who shot his brother twice as a kid. You may choose not be believe that story, but for me it seems plausible. I know btw that the Instructor in this case made some critical mistakes as well, and that children shooting firearms have to be supervised. But still, if the Girl had the experiance, wisdom and patience that comes with being an adult, this would have never happened. An adult acts as another layer of protection to prevent an accident. In my view, having a child handle a firearm is a little like not exercising proper trigger discipline. If you do everything else right, nothing bad can really happen. But you should never rely on doing everything else right. You might know some very mature and patient 14 year old who is really interested in hunting or sport shooting. In that case, congratulations. But I still stand by my view that that kid should wait and grow four more years. Sure, they might not get to shoot for four your years, but nobody will die. EDIT: ucaw81 has slightly changed my view.

Please don't let it dissuade you from answering. Also, the title should read: \"there is no consistent moral framework.\" The mere existence of a framework is not a very interesting point to debate. A few things first: I do eat meat, and I don't want have sex with animals. I believe both eating meat and having sex with animals are wrong. I think that the reason that I eat meat despite believing it is wrong is that it's simply what I've been doing my whole life. Okay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry. Consider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: How can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus? I don't see a justification for either behavior on'natural' grounds because while I think that both the consumption of meat and the desire to have sex with animals can come about naturally (that is to say, not artificially) there are plenty of things which occur naturally (rape, infanticide, kidnapping) that we all agree are immoral.

{"original_text": "Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly. 2. Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda executed a brutal plan to orchestrate the 911 attacks. [According to them, their major motivation was to end the presence of US in gulf countries and other motives as well.] For this purpose they chose to ram airplanes in the WTC Pentagon to achieve maximum civilian casualties and make a frightening spectacle for the US public. The ends justify the means seems to be their reasoning. Was Al-Qaeda Co justified in perpetrating 911? No one would say yes. If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000 casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 911 caused 3000 deaths. 3. Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 911 as well. 4. The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared. How do we even know the outcome of Operation Downfall? Moreover Japan was nearly close to surrendering anyway as the Secretary Of War, Henry Louis Stimson agreed: \"Japan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.\" We erased two cities and its people from history. We dehumanized them, reduced them to a statistic. W[e even censored images and stories of the Japanese victims to push the narrative in our direction] . At least the Government should officially apologize to the nation of Japan.", "text_perturb": "Why I hold up this view : 1. America ca n't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a state of war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians , women and small fry. multitude with real lives , they were emotional sentient beings ; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities exactly because we want to end a war quickly. 2. Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda executed a brutal plan to engineer the 911 attacks. [ According to them , their major motivation was to end the presence of US in gulf countries and other motives equally well. ] For this purpose they chose to ram airplanes in the WTC Pentagon to achieve maximum civilian casualties and constitute a frightening spectacle for the US public. The destruction justify the means seems to be their reasoning. Was base Co justified in perpetrating 911 ? No one would say yes. If we observe the logical thinking of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2 , we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a percentage point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their various causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000 casualties ( not taking into account the demise caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 911 caused 3000 deaths. 3. Civilians VS Army : If you believe that the ends justify the means , then put down the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a stop across. Army is a different affair. A soldier agrees to the dangers of state of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not take back alive from a war. A civilian is a different case , their involvement in a war is real remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a warfare seems unjustified. Many people curb the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base , they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they ? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was variety of justified to cause 911 as well. 4. The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall , in the long condition , is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilian would have been spared. How do we even know the outcome of Operation Downfall ? Moreover Japan was nearly close to surrendering anyway as the Secretary Of state of war , Henry Louis Stimson agreed : `` Japan had no allies ; its navy was almost destroyed ; its islands were under a naval blockade ; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks. `` We erased two cities and its people from story. We dehumanized them , reduced them to a statistic. W [ e even censored images and stories of the Japanese victims to push the tale in our direction ].

{"original_text": "Edit: To clarify, I don't mean to say that the type of people with poor crisis management aren't at risk for killing themselves; by \"legitimacy\" I'm talking about how valid the wish to die is in the first place. I also don't think that crisis hotlines are unnecessary or should be eliminated, because they very obviously help people. Those who are legitimately suicidal as I'm defining it in this post are those who actually want to die, and have a rational reason for doing so, rather than simply acting on impulse or using death as an escape from an acutely stressful situation. The duration of time that someone has a suicidal with isn't necessarily indicative of whether their wish to die is legitimate or not, but I think that having time to consider a decision and its alternatives generally helps with rationality. I also don't intend to claim that depression is a necessity for being suicidal or \"legitimately suicidal,\" although I'm sure it increases the likelihood of being so. Also, downvotes don't change views, people. I've suffered from very severe depression for most of my life, and have considered suicide quite frequently. One of the things people like to throw out is contact information to suicide hotlines, but they've never been helpful to me. My personal experience aside, I really don't see how these crisis hotlines could help someone who legitimately wants to die (as opposed to someone who uses suicide or self-harm as an escape from acutely painful emotions or a stressful situation). If you were set on dying, then why would you want to call a hotline like that in the first place? I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error. Calling a hotline is also not going to change any of the external factors that would lead up to someone being suicidal. Perhaps they would help the person consider their issues in a different light, but again I think that's evidence of poor stress management. I can't make any statements to whether or not my personal suicidal wishes are \"legitimate\" or not because there is always the looming possibility that my mental illness is clouding my judgement to some extent, but I think that it's theoretically possible that someone would want to die on a rational basis. I also don't think that suicide hotlines are generally helpful for the chronically depressed, but that's only tangential to my main argument. Once you're mentally ill for a long period of time, (I think the issue of mental illness and consent become very clouded, if for no other reason than it's impractical to deny someone consent for the majority of their lives because of a mental health condition.)

I don't think they have the need. it's annoying as hell. you take 4 steps after getting out of a battle, and arrive in another one that the run functino won't work for and you start taking damage, and then you can't escape again so you take more damage, and that just starts a whole snowball of \"oh my god fuck this shit.\" meanwhile, the battles themselves are just often an unnecessary, repetitive, near useless way to grind. the millionth time we saw a zubat in pokemon, it. it wasn't really doing anything for us. with an rpg game, the logic seems simple enough, I guess - there's a turn based system of combat, and there needs to be a way to trigger the combat screen from the overworld. and it shouldn't necessarily be purely predictable, should it? the player needs to progress and level up so they can meet their bigger challenges in the future. putting aside the discussion about other games mechanics and why in some cases it works much worse than others - there's just better, non annoying ways of doing that now. off the top of my head, paper mario on n64 had visible enemy mobs walking around. if you collided with them, you started a battle. that makes much more sense. it's not annoying. it doesn't happen every five steps. it doesn't come out of nowhere. it still accomplishes the same purpose that random encounters do. invisible enemies starting a 5 second battle transition, with a chance that you can't run, especially if you're in over your head and trying to get out of an area, with no ability to see it coming, no warning, no possibility of avoiding it, is just, bad. especially when even something like the paper mario system exists. at least that way, if you have no items, and are on your way back to somewhere because you're too injured, you have a chance of maybe avoiding the enemy mobs.

I do n't retrieve they have the need. it 's annoying as hell. you take 4 steps after getting out of a battle , and arrive in another one that the run functino wo n't work for and you start taking damage , and then you ca n't escape again so you take more damage , and that just starts a whole snowball of `` oh my god fuck this diddley. `` meanwhile , the battles themselves are just often an unnecessary , repetitive , near useless way to mash. the millionth fourth dimension we saw a zubat in pokemon , it. it was n't really doing anything for us. with an rpg game , the logic seems simple plenty , I guess - there 's a turn based system of combat , and there needs to be a way to trigger the combat screen from the overworld. and it should n't necessarily be purely predictable , should it ? the player needs to shape up and level up so they can meet their bigger challenges in the future. putting aside the discussion about other games mechanics and why in some cases it works much worse than others - there 's just better , non annoying means of doing that now. off the top of my caput , paper mario on n64 had visible enemy mobs walking around. if you collided with them , you started a conflict. that makes much more sensory faculty. it 's non annoying. it does n't encounter every five steps. it does n't descend out of nowhere. it yet accomplishes the same purpose that random encounters do. invisible enemies starting a 5 second battle transition , with a chance that you ca n't run , especially if you 're in over your head and trying to get out of an area , with no ability to image it coming , no warning , no possibility of avoiding it , is just , bad. specially when even something like the paper mario system exists. at least that way , if you consume no items , and are on your way back to somewhere because you 're too injured , you consume a chance of maybe avoiding the enemy mobs.

When I say gentrification what I'm referring to is the current trend in the United States of young white people moving into poorer neighborhoods of major cities because of the cheap rent and proximity to the attractions of the city. The complaint about this is that once this starts happening the landlords in that neighborhood start to drive rent up, hurting the poor, original residents of that neighborhood, and it's said that the new young white residents intrude on the original neighborhood culture, replacing it with their own, and drawing the attention of homogenizing businesses. I understand there are negative things that come from gentrification. Everyone's tired of seeing Starbucks and Barnes and Noble in formerly quaint little neighborhoods but I don't understand why the blame is leveled at the young people moving into that neighborhood. The reason these people are moving into the city in the first place is because they are excited by and attracted to the uniqueness of that city in the first place which I think is a step forward for America seeing as how previous generations have been trying to flee major cities for suburbs resulting in what sociologists call \"white flight\" when the middle class white inhabitants of a city leave for the suburbs because they don't like living with minorities. Now the current generation is trying to rediscover America's cities and since no one likes paying 2000month for a studio apartment they are moving into the neighborhoods that have the proximity to the city life they want without paying an arm and a leg for it and since previous generations of middle-class Americans seemed unwilling to live alongside the working class shouldn't this change in attitudes be applauded rather than derided?

{"original_text": "Update: So I think I kind of changed my view... but also I feel like the discussion is running in circles a little which is probably not anyones fault but just the nature of the topic. The dog-biting problem might not be as bad as I perceived it to be, especially in public spaces. So one could argue that a leash and breeding documentation is enough to have appropiate security. I really don't trust leashes when I cross a dog on the walkway and I feel like owners are really lax about them where I live. This belongs in their responsibilty, though. Anyway, I really enjoyed the little discussion with you guys. I consider my first CMV to be quite succesful:) I'll be giving out Deltas as soon as I figured out how.In germany there is a movement that demands muzzles only for especially \"aggressive\" breeds of dogs and every dogs' origin should be tested. Sounds like a good compromise for me. Hello there. I'm no native speaker so please have mercy:) After trying to be rational about this topic for a long time, I could only come up with the opinion stated in the headline. Dogs in public places with a jaw strong enough to harm children should always wear a muzzle. By law. Here's my explanation: Dog owners tend to trust their dogs and they trust themselves in knowing their dog's behaviour. They expose other people's integrity to their personal, arbitrary judgement call. Walking a dog in public, even on a leash, is essentially not different from holding a loaded gun in public without the intention to do harm. People would still avoid to be in shooting range. Why do people not shy away from dogs in the same way? This is because they've made good experiences with dogs before and therefore underestimate the potential danger by a great margin. People who have been bitten will usually never trust big dogs again and will find that they changed their mind a little too late. Unmuzzled dogs on sidewalks or in parks are traumatic encounters for victims of dog bites. There is also the problem of appropiate conviction. The guy who purposefully carried a loaded gun in public and then killed someone by slipping his finger is much easier to convict than a dog owner whose only mistake was a short lack of attention for his dog. Should the dog owner be convicted with manslaughter? I know I wouldn't be able to lock someone up for this long only because he didn't pay attention. This is because there was no law protecting the dog owner from endangering other people in the first place. The idiot carrying the gun knew he was breaking the law the moment he stepped out the door. The dog owner didn't. After reading this you probably think that either I've been bitten by a dog or that I'm a dog-hating cat person. I'm neither. To be honest I think that muzzles on dogs look very sad and I would rather have a better soultion for all this. However, I have a huge hate for frivolous dog owners who think that because they're not scared of their dog, I shouldn't be either. So please change my view.:) Hello, users of CMV!

Sam..... what's he actually accomplished? If I were a GM I would hesitate to draft him, not because he's gay, but because he attracts a lot of undue attention, without the proportional amount of on field impact (see: tebow). Okay, I get it, he's \"breaking barriers\" as the first gay NFL player... cool, good for him, this was a story about 3 months ago. Same with Jason Collins, a marginal talent who struggled to make a roster getting undue hype. Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier AND was actually good (MVP, All-Star, Steals champ, etc). On top of that, its not like there's been any rule against gay people playing football (statistically, I would guess he isn't even the actual first). Dude was perfectly fine being gay and playing college ball. I doubt any fans cared about who he was in a relationship with. Jason Collins played about 10 years in the league being gay without anyone having any problems. But no, they decided they needed to call a national press conference and announce it to the world that he's gay. you don't see any straight people doing silly shit like calling press conferences to announce themselves straight. it's a publicity stunt, pure and simple. Who you're seeing isn't anyone's business, but these characters seem to find the need to shove it down all our throats (pause s) while at the same time complaining that they aren't being treated fairly. Fast forward a couple months, and what part of this is actually news? Nothing. He actually got drafted? cool. what would have been a bigger story, him getting drafted in the 7th round or not being drafted at all? it would have been a huge story either way even though nothing of significance has happened. it was a publicity stunt and I dont believe that crap about him wanting to be known as just a \"football player\" and not a \"gay football player.\" Son, if that was true, you would have kept your mouth shut and not actively advertised the fact and not decided to use the national media as the platform to come out of the closet. I question why a 7th round pick is the top story on both rnfl and espn.com (with the draft NBANHL playoffs going on) I'm not homophobic and dont have anything against him being gay. my point is that I don't care. Let me paint my point of view for you: I'm a redskins fan; lets go down the list: QB: RG3: SO - Rebecca Liddicoat Griffin (M) RB: ALfred Morris: SO - ??? WR: Pierre Garcon: SO - ??? WR: DeSean Jackson: SO - ??? WR: Santana Moss: SO - ??? LB: Brian Orakpo: SO - ??? LB: Ryan Kerrigan: SO - ??? CB: Deangelo Hall: SO - (M) Only that he's marriedstraight, saw some family vaca pics on IG of the wife kids RB: Clinton Portis: SO - ??? TE: Chris Cooley: SO - ??? FS: Sean Taylor (All-Time Favorite Player): SO - ??? only that he had a GF daughter from the murder reports QB: Peyton Manning (MVP): SO - ??? QB: Tom Brady: SO - Giselse (M) QB: Aaron Rodgers: SO - ??? QB: Andrew Luck: SO - ??? QB: Tony Romo: SO - ??? ex: Jessica SImpson (a big reason why nobody likes Romo outside of DAL, too much extracurricular info and not enough playoff wins app's) RB: Adrian Peterson: SO - ??? .... on and on. Point being, nobody really cares pays attention to who athletes' SOs are (unless they're celebs themselves). We know about RG3 and Rebecca in DMV cause its friggin RG3, Franchise Savior, and literally every skins fan did a thorough background check on him the minute that trade went down, and in the weeks beforeafter. Any one of those ??? people could be gay for all I know. All of them are more accomplished than this dude. What's preventing a gay athlete from keeping his personal life on the DL like 90 of the rest of the league? THAT's what I mean about shoving it down our throats. If you need to come out to your family and friends, fine, go for it, do you. If it comes up in the locker room and a teammate asks, fine, tell them, be yourself and all that. None of that requires setting up interviews and going through the press. If someone you mention to announces it to the press and word gets out, fine, dont deny it, and proceed to do all the interviews. Its the fact that these guys are tooting their own horns that I have a problem with that makes it a publicity stunt. As far as setting an example for others like you to look up to..? I don't buy that. Yeah, maybe, but there are plenty of other celebs a lot more accomplished, famous, and successful than this dude who are openly gay. If I'm a gay person, I'm not looking up to Sam and Collins and tryna be like them, I'm looking up to people like Ellen, Anderson Cooper, NPH, Ellen Page, Elton John, etc. It's like a young black kid looking up to kwame brown instead of michael jordan. Was kwame the first (black or otherwise) kid to get drafted 1 straight outta high school? yup. do any young black high school kids look up to him? doubtful. is it hard to be a young black kid and do you still get crap from society and the system for being so? undoubtedly. can you get killed in america for being a young black kid while your killer not only walks free, but cashes in on it? yup. does that make kwame brown relevant to anyone outside of rnbacirclejerk? you tell me. yet somehow, this is still the 1 story in sports right now apparently. the media hype machine is at fault for making a bigger deal out of this than it should be (it was news in february; nothing groundbreaking has happened since). IMO sam is at fault because the way I see it, it was a publicity stunt. if you wanna try to change my opinion on that, i'm all ears and open mind. again, I have nothing against him being gay.

If I 'm a gay person , I 'm not looking up to Sam and william wilkie collins and tryna be like them , I 'm looking up to people like Ellen , Anderson Cooper , NPH , Ellen Page , Elton John , etc. It 's like a young black kid looking up to kwame brownish instead of michael jordan. Was kwame the first ( black or otherwise ) kid to get drafted 1 straight outta high pitched school ? yup. do any young black high school kid look up to him ? doubtful. is it hard to be a young black kid and do you still get crap from society and the system for represent so ? undoubtedly. can you get drink down in america for being a young black kid while your killer not only walks free , but cashes in on it ? yup. does that make kwame brownish relevant to anyone outside of rnbacirclejerk ? you tell me. hitherto somehow , this is still the 1 story in sports right now apparently. the media hype machine is at fault for making a bigger raft out of this than it should be ( it was news in february ; nothing groundbreaking has happened since ). IMO sam is at fracture because the way I see it , it was a publicity stunt. if you wan na try to change my public opinion on that , i 'm all ears and open mind. once more , I have nothing against him being gay. I have something against it being news on all the major sports news source. Hello , substance abuser of CMV ! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"original_text": "First off let me reiterate that I am talking about the ACADEMIC study of religion. I could give a fuck about theology and dogmatic tradition. What I care about is the philosophical core of religion: understanding and bringing about religious experience. The first thing that brings me to this idea is that, contrary to popular belief, science in no way has ever claimed it was truth. People have decided that it was, but all science does is create a model to make predictions. If those predictions work, then we can create tools with the model. We know very well that quantum mechanics and relativity theory are not \"true\" because they are incompatible. What they do is allow us to make predictions and therefore tools. These tools have helped us out, no doubt. But I believe that we need to shift our entire way of thinking from an understanding nature to an experiential nature. My favorite scientist, Werner Heisenberg, has this to say about it: \"The existing scientific concepts cover always only a very limited part of reality, and the other part that has not yet been understood is infinite.\" The other part is infinite. We can either keep going down a path of trying to figure out this fractal-like void of knowledge, which we are not capable in the least of doing biologically, or we can try to experience rather than understand our existence. This is done through the study of religions. Religions are all an attempt to explain an experience or set of experiences that people have. This includes Judeo-Christian, Pagan, Eastern, any sort of thought. What they are all attempting to do, at their core, is bring about the experience of something. Judeo-Christian thought wants to bring about heaven, and as Jesus says in the Gospel of Thomas (which is just as legitimate as any other text) the kingdom of heaven is here. The Qu'ran says turn your head in every direction and there you see the face of Allah. Buddhism speaks of Nirvana, Hinduism speaks of Moksha, Taoism of the sage, all of these are experiences of the one-like nature of the universe. That brings us back to Heisenberg \"There is a fundamental error in separating the parts from the whole, the mistake of atomizing what should not be atomized. Unity and complementarity constitute reality.\" Science, religion, they all talk about the unity. What we cannot do, according to Heisenberg and science, is understand. We can, as he says \"speak of it in images and parables.\" Sounds a lot like religion. We can understand that the big picture is completely unfathomable, and realize that what we really should do is experience the big picture through the study of religion. Maybe this is Judeo-Christian charity. Maybe this is Eastern meditation. Maybe its a good fuck or a nice view or dancing around. I don't care what your method of experience is, but religions are the study of this experience. They provide ways to bring about the experience. These experiences are just as \"real\" as anything else. You simply cannot say that I have not had religious, unexplainable (other than what I would call magic) experiences with the love of my life on top of a skyscraper in Tokyo 15,000 miles away from home. You cannot say that Ayrton Senna did not \"see god\" as he says all the time about him winning F1 races. You cannot say that someone dancing around losing themselves completely on acid at a Grateful Dead show did not have an unexplainable religious experience. These experiences are all real, and are all attempted to be explained by religious studies. Maybe Senna did not see a Christian god. But he had a religious experience, he experienced something and attempted to explain it with is home tradition that he had heard his entire life. The academic study of religion is important to this entire realm of experience. We need to study these experiences, and maybe even make them our goal as a culture. I am not saying science sucks and we should abandon it. It creates great tools and has helped us immensely. But it is an upaya, (in the Buddhist term) a tool. It is a great thing, but we cannot lose sight of the equally sized realm of experience that is studied through religion. Religious study is also upaya, and we should use it where it is helpful.

I believe that we will never be satisfied with what we have, there will never be equality for all, we'll continue to destroy the environment and in the end, we will all die a much worse death trying to live happily than one that would come form purposefully erasing our existence.

I understand perfectly where this will get me, but I am simply not willing to throw all my time and energy into things I see as unnecessary. Don't get me wrong I'm not some party high schooler, quite the opposite really. I am an all honors student with many AP classes that I have been scheduled to take next year after taking one AP class this year (sophomore year). I don't waste my time with things I see as trivial and slowly school has turned into something I see as trivial. Instead of doing my school work I spend timing learning how to program or watching a documentary on issues in this world. I write, I read, and I just try to learn everything I can but just not at school. I feel like I need the freedom to choose what I do and when I do it and I am just not allowed this with school. Every morning I wake up at 6:45 sit through painstakingly boring classes with rare highlights as there is just one or two classes I can somewhat enjoy. If there's a test it's a 5050 that I'll turn it in half blank and if it's a lecture or some other activity I'll tune in only once awhile to get the gist of the lesson. I sometimes look around to my peers and see people with 4.0 gpa's who are completely focused on school. I see them during free periods doing all the work assigned and I see them get mad when they get 2 points taken off. When I see this I can appreciate the effort, but at the end of the day there are literally thousands of other people just like them. Every school in the country has a couple valedictorians who will all be competing to get into the \"best\" colleges and a majority of them will not make it. I think I understand the importance of college and I feel like I would excel at some of the top university, but as of now I not chasing that 4.0 gpa required to get there and I don't see myself doing that anytime soon. I love to learn, I really love to learn and I teach myself new things I find interesting and useful everyday. That passion continues grow but it's pushing me away from going to the best colleges which I have been told will allow me to achieve the things I want to do. So please tell me why I should need to get that 4.0 gpa and go to the best of the best of colleges. I want to help the world, but I'm not sure I'm going about it in the right way.

I am an all honors student with many AP classes that I have been scheduled to take next year after take one AP class this year ( sophomore year ). I do n't waste my time with things I see as trivial and slowly school day has turned into something I see as trivial. Instead of doing my schooltime work I spend timing learning how to program or watching a documentary on issues in this world. I write , I read , and I just try out to learn everything I can but just not at school. I feel like I need the freedom to choose what I do and when I do it and I am just not let this with school. Every morning I wake up at 6:45 sit through painstakingly boring classes with rare highlights as there is just one or two classes I can fairly enjoy. If there 's a test it 's a 5050 that I 'll turn it in half blank and if it 's a lecture or some other activity I 'll tune in only once awhile to get the gist of the example. I sometimes look around to my compeer and see people with 4. 0 gpa 's who are completely focused on shoal. I see them during free periods doing all the work assigned and I see them aim mad when they aim 2 points taken off. When I see this I terminate appreciate the effort , but at the end of the day there are literally thousands of other people just like them. Every school in the country take in a couple valedictorians who will all be competing to get into the `` best '' colleges and a majority of them will not make it. I think I understand the importance of college and I feel like I would excel at some of the top university , but as of at once I not chasing that 4. 0 grade point average required to get there and I do n't see myself doing that anytime soon. I love to learn , I really love to learn and I teach myself novel things I find interesting and useful everyday. That passion continues grow but it 's pushing me away from going to the best colleges which I have cost told will allow me to achieve the things I want to do. So please tell me why I should need to convey that 4. 0 grade point average and go to the best of the best of colleges. I require to help the world , but I 'm not sure I 'm going about it in the right way. Edit : Thanks for all the advice bozo. It 's been very helpful and I 'll be visiting this thread in the futurity when my determination will inevitably falter. Hello , users of CMV ! This is a footnote from your moderator.

Over the weekend we were playing Mario Kart 64 and for as long as I can remember my go to character for Nintendo games has been Peach. There's really no particular reason I do this other than I seem to do the best with Peach. When I won the grand prix my girlfriend said \"Ugh, I hate Peach, she's such a weak and stereotypical female video game character.\" To which I jokingly replied \"Wow, that's a SUPER sexist thing to say, and she's obviously not that weak since I crushed you with her.\" And her response to that was \"Peach negatively reinforces the idea that women are weak and can only be saved by men in power like Mario.\" Then I made the mistake of saying \"Well I don't think that's true.\" We ended up getting into an argument over the portrayal of females in video games and how that perpetuates stereotypes in the real world. Her main argument was that most females in video games are portrayed as weak and need help from the male characters and this is detrimental to women in real life. There were two issues I had with her argument, the first one being that there are a TON of badass female characters in video games who don't need no man: Samus, Rosalina, ZeldaSheik, Palutena, Bayonetta, Lara Croft, Ellie from the last of us, and GLaDOS (just to get a female villain in there). She shrugged this off by saying it's still not enough because male protagonist characters outnumber female characters in video games. I feel like she wouldn't be happy unless the numbers of male and female characters are exactly equal. The second, and main issue I had with her argument is even if all female characters were represented as weak and helpless, I sincerely doubt there is any correlation between these characters and real world issues for women. For me video games are make believe, fiction, and stories. They're imaginary worlds with imaginary characters. Saying the portrayal of women in video games perpetuates real societal problems for women (like pay inequality) is about as absurd to me as saying violence in video games perpetuates violence in real life, which from what I can tell [has been thoroughly debunked] . Most reasonable people realize that women don't wear bright pink dresses, pick vegetables with faces out of the ground, and get kidnapped from a giant turtledinosaur hybrid. I provided my argument, and also said if Mario's and Peach's roles were reversed I could seriously not care less, as long as the game was still fun. Her response was \"You won't ever understand because you're a guy.\" I tried to continue on the debate but was met with the same response every time: \"You won't ever understand because you're a guy.\" So here I am trying to change my view, while I may not agree with the feminist issue of women in video games, I feel like I'm more empathetic than what my girlfriend is giving me credit for. Have there been studies done about the portrayal of women in video gamesstories and their effects on society? Is there any hard evidence for this correlation? EDIT: Yes, I get it, some people's feelings are hurt that Princess Peach is portrayed the way she is, and while making people upset IS a negative effect, this is not what I'm looking for.

{"original_text": "I believe that Congress should have only one chamber, rather than two, one with proportional representation (the House of Representatives), and one with fixed representation (the Senate). The process by which a bill goes through Congress seems to me to be unnecessarily complicated by having two chambers, and I believe the legislative process would run more smoothly with only one. As it stands, bills have to start in one chamber, then go to the other, then fly back and forth between them as many changes are made, sometimes only to be changed back, and multiple votes have to be taken when one would suffice. It gets particularly slow and unproductive when the chambers are controlled by opposite parties. I can't think of anything two chambers can do that one can't do better. Changes to bills can be good, but that can happen internally, it doesn't need to be external. There is no need to have different committees in different chambers, one set of committees in one chamber would suffice. One chamber suffices for floor debate, and, most importantly, one chamber is all that is needed to pass legislation and to represent the people. An extra chamber is nothing more than an extra complication, that slows the process but adds nothing to it to improve the quality of legislation, and just leads to more political theatre and less productivity. Obviously, such things will exist regardless, but the existence of two chambers exacerbates the problem. I just don't see any real advantage to this mess. Even the people who created this system didn't really desire two chambers, it was merely an acceptable sacrifice to reach a compromise between people desiring proportional and fixed representation. I think people would be able to understand the legislative process a lot better if it was clearer, and the process would overall just be more efficient with no loss in the quality of legislation. Note: I intentionally did not discuss which form of representation I would prefer, proportional, fixed, mixed, or other. I do have a preference, but I consider that a separate issue from the number of chambers. EDIT: I have been convinced that under our current system, this would not be feasible. However, I think that if elections were publicly funded, or some other means of comprehensive campaign finance reform, and gerrymandering were similarly eliminated, that it would then be beneficial to have a unicameral legislature, with the same proportional system as the House of Representatives. This would allow the voters to have the power they should have anyway that would be sufficient to help keep the system under control. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

There are definitely some high points in the show: Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Giancarlo Esposito gave terrific performances, and without them I think the show would not have had the success it had. Gus' arc is IMO the peak of the show, with Gus' back story and general awesomeness. The other characters though, feel irrelevant and without much to offer.

He could singlehandedly fix the corruption of the South, or at least try to while others tried to kill him, but we can't have that, now can we? The story must keep not going anywhere.

I just want you all to know that you have successfully changed my view! Thank you so much for all your insight, I really appreciate it. I watched the documentary on A-Sexualism and I'm not convinced. I think these people that identify as \"asexual\" either haven't found the'right' person for them yet, are just looking for attention, or just joining part of a trend to seem'interesting' or'different'. I think if you're born with a set of a genitals, you are in fact a sexual being and in turn, feel some sexual attraction to other humans. I understand how this can be offensive. I look at my brother who is gay and I understand where he comes from, and the obstacles he overcomes through being gay, and I just can't sympathize with people who identify as'asexual' and implicate that they endure the same struggles as someone from the LBGT community.
