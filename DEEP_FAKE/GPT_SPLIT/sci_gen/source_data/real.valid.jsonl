{"original_text": "Cricket and Nigeria may seem an incongruous pairing, but in Lagos many a weekend players in their colourful kit take to the crease on a dusty pitch in a fiercely competitive cricket league. \"This league actually boasts about 99 of the Nigerian national team,\" says Femi Solebo, who chairs the Club Cricket Committee Lagos and also plays for the Ibeju Lekki Cricket Club. Watching a game from the welcome shade of the pavilion, he occasionally shouts out instructions to his batsmen taking on Government College Ibadan in a 50-over game. \"Over the last three or four years Nigerian cricket has stepped up quite a lot and has allowed these guys here to show their stuff at an international level,\" he says. \"Recently the national team got promoted to division five in the World Cricket League, which is a huge achievement for us - we've never been there before in the history of Nigerian cricket.\" Mr Solebo, who first started playing cricket whilst at school in the UK, reckons that in a population of more than 170 million \"there must be a million or so followers of cricket in Nigeria quite easily.\" However, not many of them are at Tafawa Balewa Square Cricket Oval next to Lagos' dilapidated old racecourse. Besides a few team members on the stand and a man barbecuing meat, only a small group watches from deckchairs under a nearby tree, keeping refreshed with drinks from a cool box. Some of them turn out to be former Nigerian internationals - stalwarts of the game, some of whom are updating a chat group of enthusiasts with the latest scores by mobile phone. Femi Solebo, Club Cricket Committee Lagos chair: I joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me \"In our time we didn't have as much exposure as the current national team does, we were restricted in playing in just the West African region,\" says Barnaby Ephraim, who now helps administer the game in Lagos. He says it is the Lagos league, which was started more than 15 years ago, that has helped raise the profile of cricket and the opportunity to play it outside school and university. It is also tempering attitudes that see the game as elitist and old fashioned, with some schools - even the established private ones - not seeing the sport as a priority. And Mr Solebo admits it is difficult to rival football as there are not the fans to warrant tickets that would pay for the upkeep of a turf pitch. The ground the teams use is often rented out by the cash-strapped Nigerian Cricket Federation - and with upcoming elections, political rallies have recently been held here, playing havoc with the pitch, already like concrete after the dry Harmattan season. The game is also expensive for players given the kit needed. \"With soccer, all you need is just one ball and then you're away,\" says the 45-year-old. But he says whilst the league is sponsored by private individuals like him with a passion for the game, most of the 400 players in its two divisions are \"from the streets.\" The Ibeju Lekki club helps pay for either a player's education or vocational training - and subsidises kit and lunches. Kunle Adegbola, Nigerian cricket captain: Cricket is just evolving in Nigeria.... in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football \"Whatever it is they want to do, we'll fund that and insist that you can only be a member of this club if you have some kind of educational background - and that's what the other clubs try to do as well,\" says Mr Solebo, who runs a company that generates electricity. \"I joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me. \"Some of them are doing very well in university, some of them have left and are working now.\" A few of Lagos' cricketers have even gone professional, like Nigerian cricket captain Kunle Adegbola. The towering 33-year-old has come to practise for his Foundation Cricket Club in the nets ahead of a game the next day. When the season ends in April in Lagos he will head off to London, where he has played for Burgess Park and Blackheath cricket clubs in the past. He says with more awareness, spectators and sponsorship, he sees great things for Nigerian cricket. \"Cricket is just evolving in Nigeria.... in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football,\" he says. But the Lagosian cricketers know gaining such momentum will only be achieved with serious corporate sponsorship - which would be more likely if ongoing negotiations with a cable TV company bear fruit. So far TV executives have been reluctant to go ahead as they would prefer a national league. \"But we say that we can take it in phases, adopt Lagos first and then you can open up,\" says Mr Ephraim, vice-chair of the Lagos State Cricket Association which is also trying to rejuvenate youth interest in cricket. He says that unlike other states there are 35 schools in Lagos now playing cricket - with both boys and girls participating. Ibeju Lekki player Endurance Ofem agrees junior involvement is key to putting cricket on a football footing. But the former captain of the Nigerian side says offering national team players good welfare packages like those available to professional footballers is important too. \"If you do that, every youngster sees the reason to come and play cricket.\" For Mr Solebo, competing with football is not the issue - it is the cricket that matters. \"It makes me very proud that our efforts give people joy every weekend - they come here, play with passion and it's fantastic.\"", "text_perturb": "Cricket and Nigeria may seem an incongruous pairing , but in Lagos many a weekend players in their colourful kit take to the crease on a dusty pitch in a fiercely private enterprise cricket league. `` This league actually boasts about 99 of the nigerian national team , '' says Femi Solebo , who chairs the Club Cricket Committee Lagos and also plays for the Ibeju Lekki Cricket Club.

{"original_text": "The pop star was given the night's top honour for her multi-million selling record 25, but told the audience, \"I can't possibly accept this award.\" \"I'm very humbled and I'm very grateful, but Beyonce is the artist of my life.\" The British singer then appeared to break the award in two accidentally and offer a piece to her fellow nominee. Adele's victory over Beyonce is certain to boost complaints that the Grammys habitually overlook black artists. Several artists, including Frank Ocean and Kanye West, chose to skip this year's ceremony on that basis. Ocean even declined to submit his critically-acclaimed album, Blonde, for consideration, saying the Grammys did not \"seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down.\" Two years ago, West rushed onto the stage in protest when Beck's Morning Phase beat Beyonce's last LP in the best album race. However, Adele's 25 was by far the biggest-seller on this year's shortlist; outselling Beyonce's Lemonade by a factor of 10 to 1. It is unclear if Adele will officially reject her award. If she does, it would only be the second time in history that has happened. The last was in 1990, when Sinead O'Connor turned down best alternative album for I Do Not Want What I Have Not Got, claiming the ceremony was too \"commercialised.\" Main winners Whatever the outcome, Adele remains one of the night's biggest winners. She won five prizes in all, including three of the top four: Best album, song of the year and record of the year - the latter two both rewarding her 2015 comeback single, Hello. Chicago's Chance the Rapper also took three prizes, including best rap album for his self-released record Coloring Book. \"I know people think independence means you do it by yourself, but independence means freedom,\" he said as he picked up best new act at the start of the ceremony. Rock icon David Bowie won in each of the five categories he was nominated for, including best alternative album, for Blackstar, and best rock performance, for the album's title track. And Beyonce wasn't left completely empty-handed: she took home best urban contemporary album and best music video, for the politically-charged Formation. The star, who is pregnant with twins, also gave an ambitious and logistically complex performance of the songs Love Drought and Sandcastles, themed around the ideas of rebirth, regeneration and healing. Dressed in flowing, golden Egyptian robes and an elaborate headdress, she dedicated the performance to motherhood, proudly displaying her baby bump as she sang. But while Beyonce's performance was flawless, others were marred by technical issues. Lady Gaga duetted with Metallica on the song Moth to the Flame, but singer James Hetfield was inaudible throughout the first verse. He later sang cheek-to-cheek with Gaga, sharing her microphone, but angrily threw his guitar to one of his roadies at the end of the performance. Adele also went off-key during a tribute to George Michael, and tearfully asked if the song could be started again. It was, and she received a standing ovation for her troubles. Respects were paid to Sir George Martin, Leonard Cohen and other musicians we lost in 2016, while Bruno Mars honoured Prince by playing the star's trademark cloud guitar in a pitch-perfect rendition of Let's Go Crazy.

During the hearing, the judge was told that 42 fish were killed by the sewage after a \"large quantity\" of sewage filtered into Whitelake River.

The 2014 winner Vos won the 119km stage from Nottingham to Stoke in a sprint finish. Sunday's 113.2km final stage runs from Northampton to Kettering. Vos, who lost the yellow jersey to Armitstead on Friday, won in what was a reduced sprint, with only 20 riders at the front of the race to battle it out after the bulk of the day's climbing was packed into the second half of the stage. Boels Domans rider Armitstead had attacked along with Elisa Longo Borghini, Moolman-Pasio and Emma Johansson with a little under 20km remaining, catching and passing lone breakaway rider Emilia Fahlin. Armitstead said: \"The race stayed together until the climb and then me, Ashleigh and Elisa went on the second Queen of the Mountains [intermediate sprint]. Emilia was in no-man's land so she came back up to us. \"There was a bit of co-operation for maybe five kilometres and then Emma and Elisa started attacking.\" But the chasing pack, including Vos, battled back and caught them shortly before the 1km-to-go Flamme Rouge to set up the sprint finish. She added: \"In the final kilometres I could tell [the peloton] were coming back. \"Coming into the final kilometre there were a couple of turns with up-hill flickers and again Emma and Elisa were attacking, so it was just about covering them. \"As the group from behind pulled, I tried to put myself in a good position but got caught out a little bit on the last corner.\" Women's Tour 2016 - stage four result 1.

The coalition government rejected a minimum price for alcohol in 2013. Health ministers said they would look at the evidence carefully. The public health review says that alcohol is now more affordable and people are drinking more than they did 40 years ago, making it the leading risk factor for ill health, early death and disability in those aged 15 to 49 in England. More adults are non-drinkers but there are still more than 10 million people in England drinking at levels that could damage their health. The report suggests there were 167,000 years of working life lost to alcohol in 2015 - mainly among the young and middle-aged. It concludes that reducing the affordability of alcohol is the most cost-effective way of reducing alcohol harm.

{"original_text": "It was the famous Fairfield yard which took the Upper Clyde to great heights and worldwide prominence. The yard was founded in 1864 by William Elder, a talented marine engineer who developed the compound engine which transformed shipbuilding by allowing vessels to use fuel more efficiently and travel further. Under William Pearce from 1888, the company flourished, building luxurious ocean liners, steamers and naval ships for the world. At its peak before World War 1, the Fairfield shipyard was part of a local industry which directly employed 70,000 workers in 19 yards. The largest crane in the world, with a maximum lift capacity of 250 tons, was built at the Govan yard in 1911 and in the following year Fairfield had 12 ships under construction at the same time. The inter-war years saw a gradual decline but Clydeside's largest shipyard still built many famous ships and during wartime it was a major builder for the Royal Navy. But after World War 2, the decline set in swiftly and despite a major modernisation programme in the 1950s the yards of the Clyde were unable to compete with new shipbuilding superpowers such as Japan. By 1967 the receivers were called in and it looked as if the end had come for Fairfield and for shipbuilding in Govan. Sean Connery, at the height of his James Bond fame, made a documentary about problems besetting the yard, entitled The Bowler and the Bunnet. Among the footage of a community on the edge of oblivion was Connery riding a bicycle around empty shipyard fabrication sheds. The UK government's response to the crisis was to create the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS) in 1968, which had about 8,500 workers in five yards - Fairfield's and Stephens on the south bank, Connel's and Yarrow's on the north bank, and John Brown's at Clydebank. In 1971 UCS went into receivership and was refused a government loan. This led to one of the most famous episodes in industrial history - the work-in. The unions, led by Jimmy Reid and Jimmy Airlie, occupied the yard and made a demand of the then Conservative prime minister Edward Heath for the \"right to work.\" In February 1972, the government agreed to retain two yards, Yarrow at Scotstoun and Fairfield's at Govan. Fairfield's was formed into Govan Shipbuilders in 1972, which was itself later nationalised and subsumed into British Shipbuilders in 1977. The government of Margaret Thatcher broke up British Shipbuilders and denationalised it in 1988, when the former Fairfield yard was sold to the Norwegian Kvaerner group. Kvaerner took the yard through another modernisation programme to enable it to specialise in the construction of liquefied natural gas and chemical tankers. But in the late 1990s, the market became depressed and the yard had to find alternative contracts. The yard passed to BAE Systems in 1999 and has found work over the past decade making destroyers and aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy. BAE is a key partner in the construction of the two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers being built at the Portsmouth yard and in Scotland.

Deputy Interior Secretary Felipe Zamora Castro and the interior ministry's chief press officer Jose Alfredo Garcia Medina were also killed in the crash along with other government officials and the air force crew, Ms Sota said.

Ms Sota said the craft went down in the Xochimilco area, just south of Mexico City. By Ignacio de los ReyesBBC Mundo, Mexico Francisco Blake Mora was one of the president's right-hand men. Not only because he was in charge of domestic affairs, but also because he became one of the most strident voices of Mr Calderon's strategy against the drug cartels. In recent months, he helped co-ordinate the army, navy and federal police in the fight against drug trafficking in violence-torn cities like Veracruz or Acapulco. But his death could be a severe blow to Mr Calderon at a personal level too. Three years ago, one of the president's best friends, then Interior Secretary Juan Camilo Mourino, was killed in a plane crash in Mexico City. That accident was one of the saddest moments for Mr Calderon since he took power in 2006, he said. Mr Camilo Mourino was remembered by members of the cabinet, including Mr Blake Mora, this week. His last message on his Twitter account (FBlakeM) was actually dedicated to Mr Mourino. \"The cloudy conditions at the time certainly make you think about the probability of an accident,\" President Calderon said in a televised address. He said a thorough investigation of the accident was being launched and cancelled a trip to Hawaii for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum. US President Barack Obama called Mr Calderon to offer his condolences, a US government spokesman said. Mr Obama \"reinforced his commitment to the close partnership between the United States and Mexico in this difficult time,\" said US National Security Council spokesman Ben Rhodes. The interior secretary is Mexico's senior cabinet position and the top official after the president, with responsibility for domestic affairs and security. Mr Blake was Mr Calderon's fourth interior secretary. One of his predecessors, Juan Camilo Mourino, was killed in a plane crash in Mexico City three years ago. Mr Blake began his political career in the north-western border city of Tijuana in the mid-1990s, later serving as interior secretary for Baja California state. He also served as a federal congressman from Mr Calderon's National Action Party. He earned a reputation as being a hardliner in Mexico's struggle with drug cartels. Mr Blake Mora frequently travelled to cities badly affected by the cartels, such as Veracruz and Ciudad Juarez, to help co-ordinate the government's response.

{"original_text": "Yet again, you feel for the families of those killed on board, and the people that actually survived the ordeal. It seems never ending. In less than a year two Malaysian aircraft have been lost, with 537 people on board. The AirAsia accident - en route to Singapore in December - killed 162. It is not just the accidents. It's the fact that whole aircraft are going down without warning. You would be forgiven for thinking that flying is becoming more lethal. But you would be wrong. In fact, when you look at the number of crashes and fatalities compared to the huge number of people flying today (3.2 billion passengers last year), we are in a golden era of aircraft safety. According to safety analysts Ascend, 2014 was narrowly the safest year ever, with one fatal accident per 2.38 million flights, compared to every 1.91 million flights the year before. It must be noted that that does not include the loss of the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine, where 298 people died, which they count as a war loss rather than an accident. But even with that flight added it is not a terrible year, historically. Another respected organisation, the Aviation Safety Network, registers 21 fatal accidents in 2014 (this time including Ukraine), compared to 29 in 2013 and 23 the year before that. Nearly 1,000 people died in 2014, which is 700 more than the year before. Horrible numbers, but compare that to the worst year, 1972, when 2,370 passengers were killed - and far fewer people were flying then, maybe a quarter of the number travelling today. So why is flying getting safer? Well, technology. \"Think of your car in the 1970s,\" David Learmount, from Flightglobal tells me. \"The brakes, the handling, the lack of safety features. Well, aircraft are exactly the same. \"We knew most things about aerodynamics by the 1940s. What has changed is the technology.\" Every new generation of aircraft has been safer than the one before. Better computers, design, materials. But there is another sobering factor at play here too. Every tragedy has taught designers something new. Go back a couple of decades and the biggest killer was something called Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). A benign name with a morbid outcome, it normally involved a perfectly serviceable aircraft coming into land, then hitting something on the ground without the crew even knowing it was there. Many airports are near hills. Then along came a piece of equipment that was to transform safety: the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System. \"It's like a sat nav that can help you thread your way through hills and mountains, even in clouds,\" David says. Here is another example of how disaster has led to safer flying. In 1985 a British Airtours aircraft was taking off from Manchester Airport, en route to Corfu. The pilots aborted at the last minute because one of the engines failed, but the aircraft was also on fire. Fifty-four people died fleeing the smoke, the aisles were jammed with passengers panicking to get out. Next time you fly, look at the floor. You will probably see strip lights along both sides of the aisle, then they turn and lead to each exit. That idea comes straight from the Manchester fire. The lights mean passengers can find the exit, even crawling on their hands and knees through thick smoke. \"Our founder was actually working on emergency guide lights to help people escape from nuclear power stations and submarines,\" says Nigel Duncan, boss of STG aerospace. \"This accident made him realise they could be used in planes too.\" Nigel's company now supplies guiding lights for the floors of 9,000 airliners. They are photoluminescent, \"which means they are fail-safe.\" \"It's a chemical process so they don't need power - sever it and it still works,\" he says. For the most part, computers fly modern airliners. And they are very good at it. But all of this safety-driven automation has led to a new safety concern that is uncomfortable to hear. Pilots don't get enough practice at actually flying planes. The computer has taken them out of the loop. Six years ago, Air France flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic, killing 228 people. Yet there was nothing critically wrong with the plane. So why did it crash? Well, the weather was bad and a small tube froze up, knocking out the speed indicator. The actual speed was fine, but the speed data on their screens was all over the place. Suddenly, the computer didn't know how fast it was going, and it handed control back to the pilots. Confused, in bad weather, in darkness and taken by surprise, they couldn't work out what was happening, so they kept climbing to the point where the aircraft stalled, effectively stopping in mid-air and falling from the sky. Unsurprisingly, plenty in the industry want more hands-on training for pilots. \"A few years ago the airlines used to get more crew from the military and those guys were used to manually flying aircraft right on the edge,\" David Learmount tells me. \"Today, many pilots don't have that kind of background training.\" Having said all of that, just bear in mind: Nothing is ever without risk, but the chances of dying in an aircraft \"accident\" are lower than ever.", "text_perturb": "Yet once more , you feel for the families of those killed on board , and the people that actually survived the ordeal.

{"original_text": "It is a question that has long seemed impossible to answer, since players from different decades can never face each other at their peaks. Add in an element of nostalgia - who doesn't have a rose-tinted view of the teams they watched as a child? - plus the fact that fleeting glimpses of star players have been replaced by wall-to-wall television coverage, and it is quite a challenge to consider the merits of teams across eras. Here, with the help of SAM, the super computer built by Salford University professors Ian McHale, Rose Baker and others, BBC Sport assessed every side to have played an international match and analysed every international result. Taking into account a range of factors - including goals scored, goals conceded, the strength of the opposition faced and whether or not results were achieved in major tournaments - we have come up with the top 10 teams of all time. There are no English or Italian teams. As for the winners? You might well be surprised. Line-up: Sepp Maier, Berti Vogts, Franz Beckenbauer, Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck, Paul Breitner, Rainer Bonhof, Uli Hoeness, Wolfgang Overath, Jurgen Grabowski, Gerd Muller, Bernd Holzenbein. West Germany had come close to winning the World Cup twice in the preceding decade, losing 4-2 to England at Wembley in 1966 and 4-3 to Italy in a spectacular semi-final in Mexico four years later - so the stage was set for it to be third time lucky for veteran coach Helmut Schoen and his team as the host country in 1974. Media playback is not supported on this device They were guided on the pitch by an all-time great in the shape of Franz Beckenbauer. They had world-class defender Berti Vogts in their ranks. Wolfgang Overath was the midfield strategist and in attack they had the marksman supreme in Gerd Muller, scorer of 14 goals in 13 World Cup matches. Their meeting with the Netherlands in the final got off to the worst possible start when they conceded a first-minute penalty, but through sheer determination, and no little quality, they fought their way back to win through Paul Breitner's penalty and, inevitably, a winner from Muller. This West Germany side will not be remembered with the same fondness as some of the teams on this list but, like so many of their compatriots down the years, they got the job done. Line-up: Fabien Barthez, Lilian Thuram, Laurent Blanc, Marcel Desailly, Bixente Lizarazu, Patrick Vieira, Didier Deschamps, Youri Djorkaeff, Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry, Christophe Dugarry. Just look at that line-up! Built around star midfielder and three-time world player of the year Zinedine Zidane, this was the team that began the Euro 2000 final, a side so strong that two of Europe's finest players at the time, Robert Pires and David Trezeguet, could not get in the first XI. It was a group consisting largely of the players who won France's first World Cup in 1998, but with a few tweaks. Media playback is not supported on this device One, in particular, took the French to the next level. Out went striker Stephane Guivarc'h, scorer of just one goal in 14 internationals, and in came 22-year-old Thierry Henry, a forward who would go on to score 51 goals in an international career spanning 13 years. With Laurent Blanc in for Frank Leboeuf in defence, Patrick Vieira replacing Emmanuel Petit in midfield and attacker Christophe Dugarry taking Christian Karambeu's place, France became the first team in 26 years to win a World Cup and European Championship back-to-back - West Germany won the Euros in 1972 and followed that by claiming the 1974 World Cup. Line-up: Sergio Romero, Walter Samuel, Gabriel Heinze, Martin Demichelis, Nicolas Otamendi, Javier Mascherano, Maxi Rodriguez, Angel Di Maria, Gonzalo Higuain, Carlos Tevez, Lionel Messi. Think Argentina and the mind instantly conjures images of Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. Two iconic players, global superstars, both of whom led their sides to World Cup finals - Maradona winning one in 1986 and losing one in 1990, Messi losing out in 2014. But none of those three teams make it in to our top 10, and there is space for only one of Argentina's two most famous players. For all Maradona's individual brilliance, the 2010 side featuring Messi - as well as Carlos Tevez, Angel Di Maria and Gonzalo Higuain - are considered the best Argentina has produced. Bear in mind the fact Sergio Aguero was predominantly only a substitute and you get a sense of their attacking strength. \"To any football fan, it is odd that the results show that the 2010 team would beat the 1986 team,\" says Professor McHale. \"But there are some things that data and statistics can't pick up on - the human spirit, mental fortitude, attitude when things aren't going for you. There is only so much it can tell. \"The 1986 team lost 11 times in the three-year sample period, in part because they often played weakened teams in friendlies for a variety of reasons. That helps to explain why a team as brilliant as Maradona's 1986 side do not make the list.\" While Argentina 2010 are perhaps the surprise entry on this list, their results in the period suggest they deserve their place. Less than two months after Spain won the World Cup, the world champions were thrashed 4-1 in Buenos Aires, a result Argentina followed up two months later with a 1-0 win over Brazil. Line-up: Felix, Carlos Alberto, Everaldo, Brito, Piazza, Clodoaldo, Gerson, Jairzinho, Rivelino, Tostao, Pele. For many, the greatest team of all time. But not when judged by cold, hard stats. Pele led the way for Brazil during this period, but the names of his colleagues roll off the tongue as a list of the game's greats: captain Carlos Alberto, Gerson, Tostao, Jairzinho, Rivelino. Media playback is not supported on this device In 1970 alone, they played 14, won 12 and lost only once, scoring four or more goals five times. Therein lies part of the explanation as to why they do not feature further up the list - their opponents were often relatively weak, meaning victories earned them less credit in our ranking system. This team, though, were the stuff of fantasy, regrouping after a below-par performance in England four years earlier when Pele was kicked out of the tournament. Mexico 1970 was the great man's World Cup finale after his first win in Sweden in 1958 and he bade farewell in style. England pushed them closest in a classic group game in Guadalajara settled by Jairzinho's goal, and this was a team so good they were even able to carry a goalkeeping liability in Felix with no ill effects. The final against Italy in Mexico's Aztec Stadium was their showpiece. Goals from Pele, Gerson, Jairzinho and the brilliant flourish of passing to set up Carlos Alberto for the most famous goal in the 4-1 win was the crowning glory for an utterly brilliant side. Line-up: Jan Jongbloed, Ruud Krol, Wim Rijsbergen, Wim Suurbier, Wim Jansen, Arie Haan, Wim van Hanegem, Johan Neeskens, Johan Cruyff, Rob Rensenbrink, Johnny Rep. One of the greatest teams never to win the World Cup. The Dutch were masterly throughout the 1974 tournament, demonstrating a tactical and technical ability far above every other team, guided on the pitch by the brilliant Johan Cruyff and off it by the master of \"Total Football,\" the visionary coach Rinus Michels. Cruyff led a team full of talent in defender Ruud Krol, midfielders Arie Haan and Johan Neeskens as well as forwards Johnny Rep and Rob Rensenbrink. In the goalless draw against Sweden, the \"Cruyff turn\" was invented, as the great man bamboozled Jan Olsson with a piece of football ballet that will forever bear his name. The Netherlands then gave masterclasses against Argentina, who they beat 4-0, and the fading reigning champions Brazil, where they won 2-0. The victory was far more convincing than the scoreline suggests. There was a touch of arrogance about this side and it cost them in the final against West Germany in Munich. Instead of capitalising on Neeskens' first-minute penalty they wanted to humiliate their opponents - allowing the ruthless hosts to recover and claim the World Cup with a 2-1 win. Line-up: Manuel Neuer, Holger Badstuber, Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Philipp Lahm, Sami Khedira, Toni Kroos, Mesut Ozil, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Miroslav Klose, Thomas Muller This was the team that laid the foundations for the World Cup win that was to follow in 2014. A side which mixed the experience of Miroslav Klose (who would go on to become the all-time World Cup top scorer with 16 goals) and Bastian Schweinsteiger with a younger generation that included Manuel Neuer, Mesut Ozil and Thomas Muller, their quarter-final win against Greece at Euro 2012 was their 15th consecutive competitive victory. The defeat by Italy in the semi-finals of that tournament would prove to be little more than a blip, as Joachim Low's side embarked on a new run of 18 competitive matches unbeaten, a sequence which included a remarkable 7-1 thrashing of hosts Brazil and ended with a World Cup final victory against Argentina. Line-up: Julio Cesar, Dani Alves, Marcelo, Thiago Silva, David Luiz, Bernard, Paulinho, Oscar, Hulk, Neymar, Fred A year away from hosting their own World Cup, Brazil could hardly have been better positioned to succeed on home soil. An 11-game unbeaten run in 2013 culminated in five straight wins at the Confederations Cup, a tournament which doubled as a dry run for the main event the following summer. Not only did Brazil win that competition but they did so in style, beating France 3-0 and Italy 4-2 before hammering world and European champions Spain 3-0 in the final. They were the world's in-form team and, with Neymar as their talisman, continued their impressive record in to World Cup year, recording 10 wins in a row and 13 out of 14 in total. Yet for all that promise, this will be a team forever associated with one of the great humiliations in modern sport. A game away from a final at the Maracana in Rio, Brazil were 5-0 down to Germany in the semi-final inside 29 minutes and were eventually demolished 7-1. It was a one-off - Brazil went on to win 11 straight matches after the World Cup, including victories against Argentina and France - but that defeat by Germany is a result that will always define them. Line-up: Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Carles Puyol, Gerard Pique, Joan Capdevila, Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta, Xabi Alonso, Xavi, David Villa, Fernando Torres The inventors of tiki-taka, Spain imposed their own brand of football on the world from 2008 onwards, helped in no small part by the success of a Pep Guardiola-inspired Barcelona, whose players formed the core of the national team. With Andres Iniesta and Xavi the heartbeat of the side, Spain became the first team to win back-to-back European Championship titles (in 2008 and 2012), while they ended their wait for World Cup success when they became the first European nation to win the competition outside of their own continent by lifting the trophy in South Africa in 2010. It was a period of unprecedented dominance. Under Luis Aragones and then Vicente del Bosque, Spain set a new world record of 15 consecutive wins and went unbeaten for 35 matches. The team of 2010 boasts an 84 win percentage and the majority of the players above were involved in all three tournament successes, but that is not quite enough to make the top two. Line-up: Claudio Taffarel, Cafu, Roberto Carlos, Aldair, Marcio Santos, Dunga, Juninho, Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Bebeto, Romario Brazil went unbeaten from November 1993 to January 1996, a period stretching 28 games, taking in a World Cup win and including victories against Argentina (twice), Netherlands and England, among many others. Their scintillating form continued, as they lost just once in 20 matches in the 1996-97 season, a campaign which culminated in a Copa America triumph. Those runs are hardly surprising when you look at the players at manager Mario Zagallo's disposal - he had three of Brazil's six all-time leading goalscorers to choose from. Ronaldo, scorer of 15 World Cup goals, was just three years in to his international career in 1997, working his way into a team which could boast two of the leading scorers at the 1994 World Cup - Romario (five) and Bebeto (three). Not a bad array of attacking power. This side was made up of a group of players who won that World Cup and were beaten finalists in 1998 - a rare example of a team maintaining its strength over a four-year cycle and reaching consecutive finals. Line-up: Gyula Grosics, Jeno Buzanszky, Mihaly Lantos, Borzsei Janos, Jozsef Zakarias, Jozsef Bozsik, Zoltan Czibor, Ferenc Szusza, Ferenc Puskas, Nandor Hidegkuti, Sandor Kocsis Hungary, the best team of all time? Bear with us... The Mighty Magyars dominated world football in the early 1950s, inspired by the genius of Ferenc Puskas. This was a team embarking on a run of more than four years without defeat, and they would go on to reach the 1954 World Cup final. In 1953 they humiliated England, a stunning 6-3 victory at Wembley exposing the Three Lions' deficiencies as they lost a home game to a non-British or Irish team for the first time. England hoped for revenge in May of the following year in the return fixture but were left embarrassed once more as they were thrashed 7-1 in Budapest. So strong was the Puskas led-side that, in that summer's World Cup, they would beat West Germany 8-3 and South Korea 9-0 in surely the greatest show of group-stage strength even seen at a major tournament. They were only denied World Cup glory by the Miracle of Bern, with the West Germans defying the odds and memories of that heavy defeat weeks earlier to win the final 3-2 - after Hungary had gone 2-0 ahead in the opening 10 minutes. An ankle injury suffered by Puskas meant he was not fully fit in that game, hampering the Hungarians' attempts to cement their place as the world's greatest side. For Hungary, their team of the time was perhaps the ultimate example of a \"golden generation.\" As the graph below shows, it has pretty much been downhill ever since. Here's how the top three nations look when plotted alongside one another. No English team makes it into the top 10, but which Three Lions side does the super computer rate as the best? Despite the 1966 squad winning the World Cup, it is actually the team from 1986 that comes out as the strongest England has produced. With Gary Lineker the tournament's leading scorer, who knows how far they might have gone - and where they would appear in our top 10 - had Maradona and the Hand of God not intervened?

Line-up : Gyula Grosics , Jeno Buzanszky , Mihaly Lantos , Borzsei Janos , Jozsef Zakarias , Jozsef Bozsik , Zoltan Czibor , Ferenc Szusza , Ferenc Puskas , Nandor Hidegkuti , Sandor Kocsis Hungary , the best team of all clock time ? Bear with us. . . The Mighty Magyars dominated world football game in the early 1950s , inspired by the genius of Ferenc Puskas. This was a team embarking on a streak of more than four years without defeat , and they would go on to reach the 1954 World Cup final. In 1953 they humiliated England , a stunning 6-3 victory at Wembley exposing the Three Lions ' deficiencies as they lost a home game to a non-British or irish team for the first time. England hoped for revenge in May of the following year in the return fixture but were left embarrassed once more than as they were thrashed 7-1 in Budapest. So strong was the Puskas led-side that , in that summer 's World Cup , they would beat West Germany 8-3 and South Korea 9-0 in surely the greatest show of group-stage strength even view at a major tournament. They were only denied World Cup glory by the Miracle of Bern , with the West Germans defying the odds and memories of that heavy defeat weeks earlier to win the final 3-2 - after Hungary accept gone 2-0 ahead in the opening 10 minutes. An ankle injury suffered by Puskas meant he was not fully fit in that game , hampering the Hungarians ' attempts to cement their place as the world 's greatest side of meat. For Hungary , their team of the sentence was perhaps the ultimate example of a `` golden generation. `` As the graph below shows , it has pretty much live downhill ever since. Here 's how the top three nations wait when plotted alongside one another. No English team makes it into the top 10 , but which Three Lions side does the super computer rate as the best ? Despite the 1966 squad winning the existence Cup , it is actually the team from 1986 that comes out as the strongest England has produced. With Gary Lineker the tournament 's leading scorer , who have sex how far they might have gone - and where they would appear in our top 10 - had Maradona and the Hand of God not intervened ?

Scientists say their initial studies suggest that the object - catalogued as V774104 - is some 500-1,000km across. It will need to be tracked over time to learn the shape and extent of its orbit through the Solar System. The discovery was announced at the 47th annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences, taking place in National Harbor near Washington DC. The team behind the find is led by Scott Sheppard, from the Carnegie Institution for Science, and Chad Trujillo, from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. They specialise in detecting Solar System outliers. The previously recognised most distant object is the dwarf planet Eris. This body, which has a moon, Dysnomia, moves between 5.7 billion km and 14.6 billion km from the Sun. To put some of these numbers in context: Earth is 149 million km from the Sun, and even the most distant major planet - Neptune - seems close at 4.5 billion km, by these standards. That said, the Voyager 1 probe is further away - just. The epic robotic explorer has now ventured 20 billion km from home. The big question is whether V774104 sweeps inwards from its present location, like Eris, or outwards, like the objects known as 2012 VP113 and Sedna. These bodies are currently slightly closer in than Eris, but investigations of their orbits show they will reach far deeper into space, out to 66 billion km and 140 billion km, respectively. Models for Solar System formation suggest that such objects were probably not created in these weird, eccentric orbits. One explanation is that they have been perturbed gravitationally and pulled on to their strange trajectories by a passing planet - perhaps one that was expelled from our Solar System early in its history.

{"original_text": "Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region. For many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration. Mr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame. A mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught. To use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over. But he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore. The diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma. Since 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism. Domestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime. He was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship. His message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised \"lowlanders\" in Oromia and Ogadenia. His concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order. Measured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring. The much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele. But it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty. The democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed \"work in progress,\" has long stalled. Since the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents. Why West will miss Meles Obituary: Meles Zenawi Life in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi A plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time. Feeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival. He orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents. His death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising. That said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus. The opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up. Mr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically. He is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums. He did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable. Not in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse. From the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought. Many embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called \"new breed\" of African leaders. The Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests. He swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to \"tame\" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991. The two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea. Hostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border. It is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension. That would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond. In Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab.

He first noticed the issue in March 2014 and contacted Asda to report it. Asda said it had now fixed the problem and no customers had been affected. The firm, whose website is run by US retail giant Walmart, told the BBC: \"Asda and Walmart take the security of our websites very seriously. We are aware of the issue and have implemented changes to improve the security on our website.\" \"The points flagged pose a low risk to customers and our monitoring of these security issues indicate that no customer information has been compromised over that two-year period.\" Since Mr Moore went public with the information it has acted to improve its security. \"The small risk to customer information has been removed and an update has been applied, we're now adding further enhancements which will be completed by this evening. In short, one of the two issues is fixed but nothing that remains poses any risk to any customer information or card details,\" it told the BBC. The issue occurred because of two well-known exploits, cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), which combined, can offer hackers access to all the information users put on the site, said Mr Moore. It means that - if someone had both the Asda website open and another site that is infected with malware - they could be vulnerable to attack. \"CSRF exploits the trust a site has in the user's browser, allowing an attacker to issue requests on your behalf and from your own PC.

{"original_text": "Carlos Ghosn said there was a need to build a \"much higher awareness\" of the company's products in Brazil. When Nissan took the decision to back the Games, the Brazilian market was booming with sales of 3.8 million vehicles a year. But a recession has seen that sales figure tumble to 2 million a year. \"Without any doubt it's the right decision, the idea was to give more awareness to the Nissan brand,\" he told the BBC. The company's goal with the Olympics sponsorship is to help increase its market-share in Brazil from 3 to 5, he said. The 31st Olympic Games officially start in Rio on Friday with the opening ceremony at the Maracana Stadium. As part of its sponsorship, Nissan is supplying 5,000 cars for the Games and the Brazilian Olympic team to use. The company has used Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt in its adverts since 2012. Mr Ghosn says the global car market will continue to be sluggish until 2019, with growth of just 1 next year. He expects the US car market to be strong, and sees Europe continuing to recover \"even though it will be impacted by Brexit.\" The UK economy will see some contraction due to Brexit, \"not because there is anything wrong with the UK, but because markets hate uncertainty,\" Mr Ghosn said.

{"original_text": "As Abid Naseer started his cross-examination in a New York courtroom of the police officer who searched his Manchester bedroom in 2009, he commented it was nice to hear a Mancunian accent again. Six years ago, the Pakistani national had been living in the north-west English city where he plotted to kill hundreds in a bombing attack at the city centre's Arndale shopping complex during Easter weekend. Naseer, who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013, was convicted of providing and conspiring to provide material support to al-Qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device. Defending himself at his trial in New York, the 28-year-old was polite, calm and professional. He denied he was involved in any form of extremism. But, according to the police officer who headed up the British investigation into his activities, his courtroom conduct was a performance designed to con the jury. In a cafe overlooking the Brooklyn courthouse where the trial was held, Det Supt Mark Smith said Naseer was a good actor, an al-Qaeda trained terrorist and a man with a determination to kill hundreds of people. He said: \"He has had lots of time to develop his Westernised social skills, but I would say don't be fooled. Beneath that cool, relaxed exterior is a cold, calculated terrorist.\" Held in custody in the US ahead of his trial, Naseer had spent the months preparing his legal case and working out. One police officer commented that he had doubled in size since he was handcuffed and led away from a Cheetham Hill house in April 2009. Were it not for his arrest, detectives are convinced he would have gone ahead with a \"mass-casualty\" attack in Manchester city centre. Based upon intelligence gathered and the plots devised by other terrorists trained at the same al-Qaeda camp in Pakistan, police have pieced together what they believe would have happened. Emails sent from an internet cafe near Naseer's home had been intercepted in the weeks before his arrest. The final message led police to believe an attack was imminent. Known as the \"Hi Buddy\" email because of the way it greeted an al-Qaeda operative, it reads: \"I met with Nadia family and we both parties have agreed to conduct the nikah after the 15th and before 20th of this month. I have confirmed the dates from them and they said you should be ready between these dates.\" The jury was told female names, including Nadia, represented different ingredients used to make bombs. Wedding, or'nikah', was a standard al-Qaeda code for a terror attack. Based on the Islamic calendar, investigators believed this email was referring to a planned attack during the Easter weekend in 2009. Other evidence included photos of Naseer's friends standing in front of the main entrances to the Arndale centre. He claimed they were innocent pictures as they travelled around Manchester. But retired Det Ch Insp Allan Donoghue described the images as \"hostile reconnaissance.\" He said: \"That for me was the most alarming thing. To see each entrance of the Arndale Centre being photographed... that was clearly a means by which they would brief the would-be attackers as to what they would see as they made their approaches.\" Police think the first target would have been the Arndale Centre, which had been rebuilt following the IRA bomb attack on Manchester in 1996. The terrorists would have walked in carrying bombs made out of fizzy drink bottles in rucksacks or specially modified T-shirts. After the first wave of explosions, there would have been a second attack with more suicide bombers waiting in St Anne's Square for the rush of shoppers trying to escape. The target was chosen by al-Qaeda leaders because of the financial impact as well as the huge number of potential victims. According to Dr David Lowe, a retired special branch officer who now teaches law at John Moores University in Liverpool, it would have been a devastating attack. He said: \"It would have potentially been bigger than the 77 attack in London. It would have sent shockwaves around the world. And it would have shown that not just capital cities are targets.\" The scale of the potential disaster is something the man who led the police investigation is well aware of.

{"original_text": "But many of the people using the health service in England or Northern Ireland on Monday morning may not have noticed a huge difference. Why? Walkouts in the NHS are quite different from other sectors. When tube drivers, council staff or teachers strike the aim is to cause disruption. It is the first rule of industrial action: make your contribution count. However, the terms of engagement are somewhat different when NHS workers take part. While unions members want to make a point, they commit to not harming urgent and emergency services. Ahead of this week's action local union officials held talks with managers to plan services - as they did before the walkout on 17 October. It means there are likely to have been many staff in work who supported the strike but have agreed to keep working. Midwives are a classic example of this. The Royal College of Midwives has promised to keep maternity units running and so well over half of their members are believed to have worked. And even where staff have walked out, there appears to have been a willingness to leave the picket lines when there has been a need. In a word, pay. Ministers in England and Northern Ireland have awarded NHS staff a 1 increase, but only for those without automatic progression-in-the-job rises. These, designed to reward professional development, are given to about half of staff and are worth 3 a year on average. What is more, the offer is \"non-consolidated,\" which means it is taken away at the end of the year, meaning their pay packet returns back to the 2013-14 level, and does not count towards staff pensions. An independent pay review board had said the 1 increase should be across the board and paid in full as normal. Next year it has been suggested those not getting a progression-in-the job rise get 2, but again it should be non-consolidated. But in Scotland a 1 pay rise was given to everyone and in Wales a deal was reached last week after ministers agreed to pay 1 next year, while giving extra help to the lowest paid this year. It means the disruption during both strikes seems to have been limited to areas such as outpatient appointments and community clinics. And it is why unions are able to claim strong support for the walkout, while NHS England releases figures suggesting only about 12,500 staff - about one in 35 - did not turn up for work. But with the strike now ended, attention turns to what happens next. The simple answer is a period of work-to-rule. Members from the nine unions involved in the walkout are expected to take steps such as refusing to do unpaid overtime and insisting on taking their breaks. They may be joined by another two unions. However, as far as an end to this dispute, a solution seems some way off. As the walkout was coming to an end, unions were already telling me they would be sitting down to discuss future action. There was a meeting between the strike in October and this one, but it is thought little progress was made with the government maintaining giving a 1 pay rise on top of the progression-in-the-job pay rises was simply not affordable. Unions have been told that they are free to come up with another solution, but that there is no more money for pay. That means making some kind of compromise on the progression-in-the-job element. These can be extremely lucrative - for senior nurses and midwives they are worth??10,000 - so understandably staff are unwilling to give them up. But to understand the cause of this dispute you really need to go back to 2009. That was the year the then NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson set the health service an ambitious savings target. The NHS was told to save??20bn by 2014 - later pushed back to 2015. Sir David was adamant, though, it could not simply be achieved through cuts, but rather it had to come from efficiency savings. It works out as a productivity gain of between 4 and 5 a year - something the health service had never done before. Unsurprisingly, it has turned out to be just as difficult as expected. A report by MPs earlier this year showed significant inroads had been made, but the majority of these had not come from efficiency savings. Instead, the NHS had relied on \"quick fixes\" - namely pay restraint. Over the last four years there have been two years of freezes and two of small rises. That has had a significant impact on the pockets of health workers. Figures from Unison suggest health worker pay has fallen by 10 during this period once inflation is taken into account. But it is easy to understand - in simple money terms at least - why ministers have adopted such an approach. About 40 of the budget is spent on pay and with the NHS facing a??30bn hole in its finances by 2020, the government is under pressure to make resources stretch as far as they can. That said, ministers know they face a tricky dilemma. Governments tend to avoid getting into disputes with health workers - public opinion normally sides with them - and so a lengthy period of industrial action ahead of an election will be something ministers will be keen to avoid.

{"original_text": "She's just been in the studio with Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw, trying to make him giggle while he goes about some serious radio presenting business; and she's daydreaming about her favourite UK delicacy - a sandwich from Pret. When she discovers she's in the same building as the BBC newsroom, the star politely asks for a guided tour. \"I never get to do stuff like this,\" marvels the singer, as she walks wide-eyed past the studios and satellite feeds. In this context, Del Rey is oddly anonymous. Jane Hill, who is preparing to read the lunchtime news on BBC One, doesn't even look up when the superstar squeezes past her desk. It's a rare luxury for someone who's followed by paparazzi and the all-seeing cameras of TMZ when she's at home in California. She addresses the lack of privacy on her new album, Lust For Life, where a song called 13 Beaches finds Del Rey searching for a spot \"past Ventura and lenses plenty\" where she can enjoy a romantic moment in seclusion. When we sit down to chat, she reveals those same concerns stopped her attending the women's marches in Los Angeles, earlier this year. \"I drove my sister and her girlfriends to the marches,\" she says. \"I thought about [joining in] but I felt, like, not really sure how it would go. \"I didn't really want to be a distraction to that group of 10 girls who were going. I wanted them to think about the actual march and not about me standing right next to them.\" But the star is making her contribution in other ways. A new song, God Bless America And All The Beautiful Women In It, is an ode to womankind may you stand proud and strong; while Coachella - Woodstock In My Mind, mines the contradictions of dancing at a festival \"whilst watching tensions with North Korea mount.\" It's a new dimension for Del Rey's lyrics - which have traditionally concerned themselves with \"looking for love in all the wrong places.\" \"I kind of got jolted into the real world again,\" she says. \"Just being in California, it's such a liberal state, I was bombarded with the news every day. So my studio became like a think tank - during the elections it was a constant conversation with my producer and engineers and assistant engineers. \"And then obviously during Coachella, that news broke about North Korea and pointing missiles at each other. That was a bit of a rude awakening.\" Del Rey's work rate is astonishing. Lust For Life is her fifth album in six years - and it bursts at the seams, with 16 tracks all co-written with her longtime producer Rick Nowels. They record everything at his studio in Santa Monica, just blocks away from the beach, so it \"never feels like work,\" she says. \"Just walking in every day and having a coffee together and taking a walk, and then we start. \"So it doesn't ever feel like I'm pumping them [the songs] out. Although it's definitely a blessing that I've been able to put out so much music.\" On Lust For Life, the singer has opened up musically, as well as lyrically. The title track is a pulse-raising duet with The Weeknd, while Summer Bummer almost self-destructs, dissolving into digital noise and blacked-out beats, with Lana's vocals barely holding the song together. She's also welcomed collaborators into her world for the first time - absorbing them into her aesthetic, rather than capitalising on chart trends. \"It was really fun!\" she says of working with AAP Rocky and The Weeknd. \"I wanted those guys to add a little fire, a little energy to the record.\" More daunting was inviting rock legend Stevie Nicks to duet on Beautiful People, Beautiful Problems. \"I was definitely nervous,\" says Del Rey of the recording session. \"She got off the plane at 10:30, so she didn't get to the studio until midnight - and she just breezed in, black on black, gold everywhere. She was kind of a vision. \"When she started singing, she told me she wanted to hear me sing something, too. And then I really freaked out! \"I said to her over the mic,'I just sound so quiet compared to you.' And she was like,'That's ok, you can be my little echo!' \"I thought that was so cool. I'm not as loud as her. My voice isn't as low as hers. But she loves it for what it is. \"That, as it was happening, was a career-defining moment for me.\" Other songs on the album had a more troubled gestation. Del Rey says the closing track, Get Free, originally had a different title, and much more personal lyrics. \"That song started out really revealing,\" she says. \"I wanted to summarise my whole experience over the last six years; and then I realised, I don't want to reveal everything.\" Once the initial version was \"out of my system,\" she says, the recording was \"deleted completely then started from scratch.\" The lyrics became more vague and more hopeful; and the re-recorded version ends with Del Rey referencing Neil Young: \"I want to move out of the black, into the blue.\" \"I think it would have been hard for me to do interviews if I'd said a couple of particular things that I was thinking of,\" she says of the original. \"Kind of the way Ultraviolence did. It was harder to promote that record.\" She's referring to the title track of her second album, which depicted Del Rey in a destructive, abusive relationship. Del Rey has previously hinted the song refers to her association with an \"underground sect\" in New York, which was controlled by a charismatic guru. In concert, she has recently stopped singing the song's key line, \"he hit me and it felt like a kiss.\" \"I don't feel comfortable with that lyric any more,\" she says now. \"Whatever my concept of affection was at the time, it does not serve me any more. Obviously. Hopefully.\" On Lust For Life she seems happier, more outward-looking than before. On stage, she's more confident, too. Launching the album at a one-off gig in London, she's forced to abandon her performance of the opening track, Love. Earlier in her career, she might have frozen. Now, she just sings it a capella, with the crowd stepping in as her own personal choir. \"I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I think my keyboard player was playing the wrong chords,\" she explains. \"I was leaning in to him and saying,'That's not it, that's not it' and he was like,'That is it, trust me'. \"I listened for 10 seconds and I was like,'Damn, I definitely can't get it'. I couldn't get it in rehearsal, either. So I just told him to stop. I feel bad - I was kind of abrasive. \"But that song is at the heart of the record and I thought it'd be weird if I didn't do it. So, luckily the people who were at the show knew the words and they sang along with me.\" She listens with glee to a recording of the song - explaining how, because she wears in-ear headphones, she hadn't realised how loud the crowd had been. \"I'm so glad,\" she says. \"Being in the audience, did you feel that, too?\" I tell her it was like being in church. \"Oh, stop!\" she beams, and bursts into laughter.

{"original_text": "India's greatest leader had moved to a village called Segaon two years earlier. He had renamed it Sevagram or a village of service. He built an ashram, a commune which was home to \"many a fateful decision which affected the destiny of India.\" Gandhi had moved in with his wife, Kasturba, and some followers. There was also a steady stream of guests. Kanu Gandhi, a callow young man in his 20s and a grand nephew of the Mahatma, was also there. Armed with a Rolleiflex camera, he was taking pictures of the leader. He had wanted to become a doctor, but his parents had goaded him to join Gandhi's personal staff doing clerical work, looking after accounts and writing letters at the ashram. Kanu Gandhi had developed an interest in photography, but Gandhi had told him there was no money to buy him a camera. The nephew did not relent. Finally, Gandhi asked businessman Ghanshyam Das Birla to gift 100 rupees (1.49; PS1.00) to Kanu so that he could buy the camera and a roll of film. But the leader imposed three conditions on the photographer: he forbade him from using flash and asking him to pose; and made it clear that the ashram would not pay for his photography. Kanu made do with a stipend from a Gandhi acolyte who liked his work. He also began selling his pictures to newspapers. Over the years and until Gandhi's assassination in 1948, Kanu Gandhi shot some 2,000 pictures of the greatest leader of the Indian Independence movement. For decades, his pictures remained in obscurity, once surfacing with a German researcher who began compiling and selling them. Now, 92 of those rare pictures of Gandhi during the last decade of his life have been published in an exquisitely produced cloth-bound monograph by the Delhi-based Nazar Foundation, a non-profit trust founded by two of India's most well-known photographers Prashant Panjiar and Dinesh Khanna. This is possibly my most favourite image from the book. Here Gandhi is standing on a weighing scale at the Birla House in Bombay (what is now Mumbai) in 1945. For a man who undertook more than a dozen fasts during the freedom movement as a part of his non-violent protests - to bring peace, demand Muslim rights or to shame rioting mobs - the picture is telling. \"This is a picture of a man keeping an eye on his weight, testing himself all the time. It tells you a lot about the man,\" says leading photographer Sanjeev Saith who went through more than 1,000 images and helped curate the monograph. Here, Gandhi is seen in front of his office hut at Sevagram ashram in 1940. A pillow covers his head as protection against the severe heat. It is, at once, an intimate and remote image. Which is one of the reasons, many say, that made Kanu Gandhi's pictures of the Mahatma so special. \"Although he had incredible access to the icon, we are always struck at the way Kanu, perhaps because he was in awe of Gandhi always kept a respectful distance, and yet managed to convey a sense of intimacy and proximity,\" says Panjiar. \"And because he kept a certain distance, Kanu intuitively found a more modern language of photography than what was prevalent in those times in India, framing many of his images with an interesting and unconventional use of the foreground, breaking many of the accepted rules of composition.\" Kanu Gandhi travelled far and wide with the leader. Here's his image of a van carrying Gandhi being pushed by Pathans and Congress workers over some rough terrain in the North West Frontier Provinces in October 1938. This is a picture of Gandhi, and his wife Kasturba, in Abottabad in November, 1938. Kanu Gandhi's first-ever book of photographs chronicles the leader's political and personal journey in his last decade in vivid detail. There are pictures of Gandhi in his many moods - brooding, joyous, pensive, grieving - and with his supporters. Here Gandhi is being massaged by a relative and his elder sister Raliatbehn during a three-day fast in Gujarat's Rajkot city in March 1939. \"These images may be old, but they are not old-fashioned. They are not straightforward, beautifully shot and carefully framed, neat pictures which were popular then,\" says Panjiar. \"It possibly helped that Kanu was not a trained photographer because many of his images would have been rejected by his contemporaries on account of being blurred, slightly out of focus or double exposed. But these find pride of place, lovingly pasted by own hands in albums.\" Gandhi and his wife Kasturba are seen here at a wedding of a Christian man and an untouchable woman in Sevagram ashram, 1940. Sanjeev Saith says the picture of a dying Kasturba Gandhi lying on a bed at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune in 1944 a few months before her death counts among his favourites. A broken shaft of light is streaming in through a window behind her. \"Here is this austere woman lying regally on this stately bed, she is about to die. This picture just shakes me up,\" he says. And then there is this historic 1938 picture of Gandhi in a convivial mood with freedom hero and radical nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose. In the background, Kasturba Gandhi is drawing her sari, and looking into the distance. This was the high noon of Bose's political life: he had been elected as president of the Congress party. Gandhi had overruled objections from independence hero Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who had objected to Bose's appointment. The two leaders had shared a complex relationship and fell out later over differences. \"This is an amazing picture,\" says Saith. \"It contains two of India's greatest heroes in one frame. Bose is young, cherubic, almost looking at Gandhi in admiration. Gandhi has his characteristic toothless grin. It is a nice, warm moment.\" Here's Gandhi and Nobel Prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore in Shantiniketan, West Bengal, in February 1940, a study of two great men in meditation. \"Look at the bottom of the picture. It is an accidental double exposure [a technique which combined two different images into a single image]. It's rather inventive. Kanu Gandhi knew it was a good picture, and he didn't throw away the negative,\" says Saith. There's a series of pictures of Gandhi collecting donations for a fund for the untouchables during a three-month long train journey that took him to Bengal, Assam and southern India in 1945-46. In some he's stretching his arm from a carriage for money; in others he's surrounded by people and collecting the money in a slender basket. \"He's an old man, but he looks agile. He's almost begging for alms, and he's serious about picking up every bit of money for a good cause. He understands money,\" says Saith. \"I am a bania and there is no limit to my greed,\" Gandhi once said, alluding to his Indian caste comprising mainly of moneylenders. Being the only person who was allowed to take Gandhi's photographs at any time, Kanu Gandhi was shooting every day. Sometimes Gandhi intervened: one such moment was when Kasturba, lay dying in his lap at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. The nephew, however, was allowed to shoot this image of the leader, draped in a shawl, looking at Kasturba after she passed away in February 1944. According to several accounts, Gandhi kept a vigil for hours, sitting by her side, praying. \"After sixty years of constant companionship,\" he said later that night. \"I cannot imagine life without her.\" Ironically, for a man who followed Gandhi like a shadow, Kanu Gandhi was away in Noakhali in east Bengal when his leader was killed in 1948. \"Gandhi's death had a profound effect on Kanu and his wife, Abha's life. For Kanu, photography was no longer as important as the need to convey his leader's message,\" says Panjiar. Kanu Gandhi died after a heart attack while on a pilgrimage in northern India in February 1986. Photographs by Kanu Gandhi Gita Mehta, heir of Abha and Kanu Gandhi.", "text_perturb": "India 's greatest leader had moved to a settlement called Segaon two years earlier. He had rename it Sevagram or a village of service. He built an ashram , a commune which be home to `` many a fateful decision which affected the destiny of India. `` Gandhi had go in with his wife , Kasturba , and some followers. There was also a unwavering stream of guests. Kanu Gandhi , a unfledged young man in his 20s and a grand nephew of the Mahatma , was also there. Armed with a Rolleiflex camera , he was taking pictures of the loss leader. He had wanted to become a doctor , but his parent had goaded him to join Gandhi 's personal staff doing clerical work , looking after accounts and writing letters at the ashram. Kanu Gandhi had developed an interest in photography , but Gandhi had told him there was no money to buy him a tv camera. The nephew did non relent. Finally , Gandhi asked businessman Ghanshyam Das Birla to gift 100 nepalese rupee ( 1. 49 ; PS1. 00 ) to Kanu so that he could buy the tv camera and a roll of film. But the leader imposed three conditions on the photographer : he forbade him from using newsbreak and asking him to pose ; and made it clear that the ashram would not pay for his photography. Kanu made fare with a stipend from a Gandhi acolyte who liked his work. He also began selling his pictures to newspaper publisher. Over the years and until mahatma gandhi 's assassination in 1948 , Kanu mahatma gandhi shot some 2,000 pictures of the greatest leader of the Indian Independence movement. For decades , his pictures stay in obscurity , once surfacing with a German researcher who began compiling and selling them. Now , 92 of those rare pictures of Gandhi during the last decennary of his life have been published in an exquisitely produced cloth-bound monograph by the Delhi-based Nazar Foundation , a non-profit trust founded by two of India 's most well-known photographers Prashant Panjiar and Dinesh Khanna. This is perhaps my most favourite image from the book. Here Gandhi is standing on a weighing plate at the Birla House in Bombay ( what is now Mumbai ) in 1945. For a man who undertook more than a dozen fasts during the freedom movement as a part of his non-violent protests - to bring peace , demand Muslim rights or to shame rioting mobs - the image is telling. `` This is a picture of a man hold an eye on his weight , testing himself all the time. It tells you a raft about the man , '' says leading photographer Sanjeev Saith who went through more than 1,000 images and helped curate the monograph. Here , Gandhi is seen in front of his authority hut at Sevagram ashram in 1940. A pillow covers his head as protection against the severe heating system. It is , at once , an confidant and remote image.

Shane Bissett , director of commemorative coin and bullion at the royal stag Mint , said : `` We felt there could be no more fitting design to mark the first birthday of our future king than the royal arms - the arms of the monarch - minted in honour of the future heir to the throne. `` The choice of a silver coin is significant too , as the precious metal is closely assort with newborn babies. . . `` Crossing the palm of a newborn baby with silver is a way to wish them wealth and good wellness throughout their life , whilst the PS5 coin is a favourite for royal celebrations. `` The coins leave be a limited mintage of 7,500 and leave cost PS80 each from the Royal Mint.

{"original_text": "One of the first out of the blocks is a touring production of All My Sons by black-led theatre company Talawa. The story centres on all-American couple Joe and Kate Keller, whose son is missing after World War Two. Its director Michael Buffong tells arts correspondent Tim Masters what makes the play a 20th Century classic. What does it mean to you to be taking All My Sons on the road in Miller's centenary year? The fact that it's a centenary year shines an even brighter spotlight on what is an amazing piece of work and an amazing writer. We originally performed this in 2013 and I'd love to say I planned the tour for the centenary, but the truth of it is that it's a coincidence. What makes All My Sons an American classic? The themes are so universal. On one level it's about chasing the dream and the cost of trying to live it. The themes that come out of the play are issues of loyalty and trust and betrayal, and secrets within families and how people collude and how ultimately everything can come falling down. The themes are so universal - what would you do for your family? Joe Keller thinks anything is forgivable because it's been done for his family but he doesn't have a wider social responsibility. That's his downfall. The 2013 production earned five star reviews - does that add pressure to taking it out two years later? I haven't thought about it. If I did I might not sleep too well. I guess it might add a bit of pressure. I read reviews, you can't help it. One has to be able to take them - the good and the bad. Given that it was such a hit, how much are you tweaking this time round? Like with any fantastic play once you get to revisit it you realise its depth - we are finding so many new things. Half the cast are different so it can't be the same because they bring new elements. It just goes to show the quality of the text: there's always more to unearth. Does having a black cast give the play a new perspective? It certainly gives it a nuance. If you think of a black family trying to achieve the American dream suddenly the stakes become higher still because of black history in the US. But it essentially remains the same story: it's a family drama, and this family is an all-American family. You took over Talawa in 2012 - are there still things you want to achieve? I'm just at the beginning. The past three years have been great and we are starting to achieve some of things we set out to do. It's great that we get do do All My Sons, and we get to work with the companies like the National Theatre as we did last year with Moon on a Rainbow Shawl. We've got a writers' programme working with the Bush and Soho Theatres and the BBC, and we have a space we are desperate to develop into a 100-seat venue. We are looking for funding to do that. What's the latest on workshops you've had with Lenny Henry on a play about the American comedian Richard Pryor? We are still in the workshopping process. It's in development. I hope it will come to the stage. We are both keen to see it happen. All My Sons, with a cast led by Ray Shell and Dona Croll, has opened at Ipswich's New Wolsey Theatre, and tours until 25 April.

{"original_text": "He is the latest casualty of the Trump White House, and takes the record for the shortest term in a top job: he was fired 10 days after being announced as communications director. But of course, there is a long line of people behind him who have been fired or eased out of their jobs by President Trump. Here's a run-down of what they did, and why they left, starting with \"The Mooch.\" The brash, Wall Street big wig has known President Trump for years, and charismatically defended him in TV interviews. Although he didn't last long in the job, he made big headlines. He appeared to accuse Chief of Staff Reince Priebus of being responsible for White House leaks in a tweet (later deleted) that also appeared to threaten him. Mr Scaramucci then attacked Mr Priebus and President Trump's senior adviser Steve Bannon in an expletive-filled rant on the phone with a reporter from the New Yorker magazine. Why was he sacked? Although he had boasted of reporting directly to the president, Mr Scaramucci's ill-discipline may have cost him any post alongside President Trump's new chief of staff - retired, four-star General John Kelly. Mr Scaramucci's departure was announced hours after Mr Kelly was sworn-in to replace Mr Priebus. The White House said Mr Trump believed comments Mr Scaramucci had made were \"inappropriate.\" Time in post? Ten days. (Though his official start date was 15 August - so possibly minus-15 days.) The former Republican National Committee chairman was one of few Washington veterans given a top role in the Trump White House but was unable to assert his authority. He grappled with competing powers in an administration where Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, play key roles. Mr Scaramucci was hired despite Mr Priebus's disagreement and insulted him seemingly without reproach from the president. Why was he sacked? President Trump lost confidence in him and clearly wanted a shake-up in the White House, opting for a general to replace the Republican Party operative, who was seen as weak. The announcement also came as the Republicans failed in their efforts to repeal Obamacare in the Senate. Time in post? Six months. Mr Spicer famously kicked off his tenure as White House press secretary by defending a seemingly indefensible claim about the crowd size at President Trump's inauguration. Over the course of his time behind the podium, he became - unusually for a press secretary - a household name, and was parodied on Saturday Night Live. Why did he leave? Unlike most others on this list, Mr Spicer appears to have left on seemingly good terms with the president. He stepped down after Mr Scaramucci was appointed to a role he had partially filled, saying he did not want there to be \"too many cooks in the kitchen.\" Sarah Huckabee Sanders had also taken over many of Mr Spicer's press briefings. The New York Times reported that Mr Spicer had \"vehemently\" disagreed with the appointment of Mr Scaramucci, which he believed to be a \"major mistake.\" Time in post? Six months. Mr Comey played a dramatic and controversial part in the closing stages of the election when he announced, a week before the vote, that the FBI had reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. He was criticised first by Democrats for the timing and alleged indiscretion of the announcement, then by Republicans when he said a week later that no charges would be brought. But Mr Trump praised the FBI director heavily, saying it \"took a lot of guts\" to make his announcement and that he had \"brought back his reputation.\" He blew Mr Comey a kiss at the White House. The president grew less appreciative of him as the FBI director led an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Why was he sacked? The Trump administration first claimed Mr Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation rendered him no longer able to credibly lead the bureau and that Mr Trump had acted on the deputy attorney general's recommendation. However Mr Trump soon contradicted this, calling him a \"showboat\" in a TV interview and saying he was thinking if the \"Russia thing\" when he made the decision to sack him. Later it emerged that he allegedly told Russian officials that the dismissal had taken \"great pressure\" off him. Special counsel Robert Mueller is reported to be investigating whether obstruction of justice occurred. Time in post? Three years, eight months. Less than four months under Mr Trump. Technically, Michael Flynn resigned, but he was asked to do so by the president. His departure followed weeks of deepening scandal in which it emerged that he had misled White House officials, including the vice-president, over his contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Mr Flynn is said to have discussed US sanctions against Russia with Mr Kislyak before Mr Trump took office. Mr Trump was briefed on the possibility that Mr Flynn was open to blackmail, because Moscow knew he was lying, but 18 days elapsed before the president sacked him, raising questions about exactly what the president knew and when. Why was he sacked? It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy, and once it was established that Mr Flynn had lied about his contact with Mr Kislyak there was no question that he had to go. The question with this sacking was, why did it take so long? White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the president needed the time to investigate Mr Flynn and establish his guilt, but the scandal prompted fierce speculation over what the president knew of Mr Flynn's contacts with Mr Kislyak. Time in post? 23 days. The president fired Sally Yates after she questioned the legality of Mr Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Ms Yates, who was appointed by Barack Obama, believed it discriminated unconstitutionally against Muslims, and ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce the president's executive order. Within hours, she was fired. Why was she sacked? A White House statement said Ms Yates had \"betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States.\" It also described her as \"weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.\" But it was also Ms Yates who informed White House counsel that Michael Flynn had misled the vice-president about his contacts with Ambassador Kislyak and presented a risk of Russian blackmail as a result. The president's sacking of an Obama-era holdover who had openly defied him was certainly less controversial than the Comey dismissal, but it drew heavy criticism from Democrats, who said Ms Yates had done her job in standing up to the travel ban. Time in post? 10 days. It is not uncommon for prosecutors appointed by the previous administration to be replaced as the White House changes hands, but the widely-respected Preet Bharara had been told specifically by the Trump administration that he would be kept on. Mr Bharara had built a reputation as the \"Sheriff of Wall Street\" after a number of aggressive prosecutions of traders. At the time of his sacking, he was overseeing several high-profile cases, including an investigation into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's campaign finances and allegations of sexual harassment at Trump favourite Fox News. Why was he sacked? Mr Bharara was one of 46 prosecutors asked to resign by the Trump administration, which contended that it was part of a simple changing of the guard. But there was speculation among Democrats and others that Mr Bahara's jurisdiction, which included Trump Tower, may have concerned the president. A few days before he was sacked, three ethics groups called on Mr Bharara in an open letter to investigate whether Trump companies in his jurisdiction had received foreign payments. Meanwhile, a ProPublica investigation revealed that Mr Bharara was overseeing an investigation into stock trades by Mr Trump's incoming health secretary Tom Price. Three Democratic senators wrote to attorney general Jeff Sessions asking him to investigate the Bharara sacking. Time in post? Seven years, seven months. Less than two under Mr Trump. Paul Manafort, a long-time Republican political operative, was supposed to marshal some of the chaos around Mr Trump but ended up falling prey to it. He was sacked after five months with Mr Trump's campaign, three of those as campaign chair. Why was he sacked? The Trump campaign didn't give a reason for Mr Manafort's departure, issuing only a boilerplate statement wishing him well. But a wave of reports in the week before the announcement alleged that Mr Manafort had received secret cash payments from a pro-Russian political party for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and the US. While Mr Manafort was running the campaign, the Republican Party changed the language in its manifesto regarding the conflict in Ukraine, removing anti-Russian sentiment, allegedly at the behest of two Trump campaign representatives.

{"original_text": "Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly revenue of 80,000 (PS62,000). The firearms trade has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks. The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access, in order for users to remain anonymous. While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations, it had the potential to become the platform of choice for \"lone-wolf\" terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition, the report said. Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation Europe, working with Manchester University, found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition, explosives, or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets. Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting, which left nine people dead, used weapons purchased on the dark net. Lead author of the research, Giacomo Persi Paoli, said: \"Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real. \"The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists, who can make virtually anonymous purchases, but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect.\" Guns account for less than 1 of items sold on the platform, with its main trade being in narcotics.

The study involved collecting data from 12 dark net marketplaces during a week in September 2016. Most of those selling guns were based in the US, but Europe was the most popular destination for the weapons they sold. Judith Aldridge, co-investigator on the study, said: \"In very simple terms, anyone can connect to the dark web and within minutes have access to a variety of vendors offering their products, which are most often illegal. \"The dark web enables illegal trade at a global level, removing some of the geographical barriers between vendors and buyers, while increasing the personal safety of both buyers and sellers through a series of anonymising features that obscure their identities.\"", "text_perturb": "Those selling the illicit arm often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers , the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly gross of 80,000 ( PS62,000 ). The firearms barter has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks. The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access , in order for user to remain anonymous. While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations , it had the potential to suit the platform of choice for `` lone-wolf '' terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition , the report said. Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation eec , working with Manchester University , found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition , explosives , or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets. Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting , which left nine people all in , used weapons purchased on the dark net. Lead author of the inquiry , Giacomo Persi Paoli , said : `` Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real. `` The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists , who can make virtually anonymous purchase , but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect. `` Guns account for less than 1 of items sold on the chopine , with its main trade being in narcotics. Nevertheless , the volume being trade `` can be considered sufficiently high to be a cause of concern for policy makers and law enforcement agencies , '' said the report.

This was a hugely significant fixture for the visitors too, Louis van Gaal and his players arriving with their fate in their own hands but little margin for error. They knew victory here, amid a heady mix of nostalgia and fierce hostility, would leave them needing only to beat Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Sunday to secure Champions League football. Instead, a 3-2 loss leaves them still needing that win against the Cherries - but now requiring that neighbours Manchester City lose at Swansea. Media playback is not supported on this device As a fleet of London taxis brought a succession of West Ham greats on to the Boleyn Ground turf for the big finish to the farewell party, several cynics suggested one cab was on order to ferry Van Gaal away from Manchester United. It has been obvious since Christmas that there has been no great appetite inside Old Trafford to replace Van Gaal - if United were certain he was not the man for the job, former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho could have already been occupying his office or at least officially lined up. Even in the hours before this loss at West Ham, Van Gaal's position appeared to be gaining strength with the supposed loss of 18-year-old transfer target Renato Sanches to Bayern Munich in a PS27.6m deal. It was later suggested United had not missed out but that Van Gaal had actually vetoed the deal - and why would the club let him do that if he was not going to be in charge next season? The fact that Sanches' agent is Jorge Mendes, who would love to see his client Mourinho installed at Old Trafford, only added to the perceived political intrigue. Media playback is not supported on this device One way Van Gaal could have strengthened his position even further would have been a win at West Ham that would have made United firm favourites to beat City to fourth place in the Premier League, with the potential bonus of an FA Cup final victory over Crystal Palace in May. Indeed, so buoyed was Van Gaal by the sudden upturn in his position that he was even able to point out to the media that they were finally posing tactical questions before a game rather than asking about his possible sacking. And for four tantalising second-half minutes it all seemed on for Van Gaal. Antony Martial's brilliance had turned the game, undeservedly on its balance, in United's favour with two goals. At 2-1 up, they were 14 minutes from a win that could have offered the opportunity to put a different spin on their season. It was not to be. Old vulnerabilities quickly returned and saw United beaten by two headed goals from Michail Antonio and Winston Reid - leaving Van Gaal back on the rack. The players dragged their manager out of a hole then threw him back in again. The intention may still be to keep him next season but that decision would have been made a lot easier and more palatable with victory. Now it all goes on the line again on Sunday - but with Manchester City at the controls. The equation is simple. Manchester United must beat Bournemouth and hope Manchester City lose at Swansea - and therein lies that sliver of hope for the 64-year-old Dutch coach. City have been so unreliable, unpredictable and uninspired at times this season that you would not risk too much on the certainty of Manuel Pellegrini's side getting the job done. Of course City will be favourites and only need a point - but they are not a team to be trusted, as seen in their heavy defeat at Southampton and disappointing draw at home to Arsenal in their last two Premier League games. And after beating Liverpool 3-1 and, more impressively, thrashing West Ham 4-1 at Upton Park on Saturday, Swansea are also running into the sort of relaxed good form that makes them dangerous opponents. Confidence has been renewed to such an extent that head coach Francesco Guidolin is expected to be confirmed on a new contract after a Swansea board meeting on Wednesday. City can be fragile and United will hope that vulnerability haunts them one last time. And then all it needs is for United to beat Bournemouth - but United cannot be trusted either. Manchester United's players may have been affected by an arduous coach journey that ended in such disgraceful scenes outside Upton Park - and West Ham co-owner David Sullivan's dismissive response that the visitors should simply have arrived earlier did no credit to him or his club on this landmark night. The kick-off was delayed by 45 minutes but there was still no excuse for a tepid Manchester United first half that lacked urgency, organisation and anything that would be reasonably expected with stakes so high. They were lucky to only trail to Diafra Sakho's early goal, their defence going missing in its entirety shortly afterwards when Andy Carroll raced clear only to shoot straight at David de Gea. It was as if Van Gaal had not impressed upon his players that a door to the Champions League that had looked shut for so long was suddenly ajar. Instead it looked like meaningless, end-of-season stuff. The superb Martial offered brief hope, the normally passive Van Gaal leaping from his seat to punch the air - but the joy did not last long as the visitors' vulnerability in defence was exposed. They simply could not cope with West Ham's pressure. For long spells this was a performance that made you question how such an ordinary side could even be in contention for a top-four place. They were that poor. True, they missed the aerial strength of suspended Marouane Fellaini, who operated with such success to not only combat the likes of Carroll but also score when Manchester United won 2-1 at Upton Park in the FA Cup quarter-final replay. In the final reckoning, however, this defeat was deserved after a display that produced much of the evidence that has left so many United fans questioning Van Gaal's future. Van Gaal will still believe his side can reach the Champions League but the odds are against them now so he may well end up looking to the FA Cup for success. If United win he will undoubtedly paint this as progress - and he will have a point as it would be the club's first major trophy since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. It may not be enough, however, to suggest Van Gaal is pointing United in the right direction, despite his willingness to play youth with the emergence of 18-year-old Marcus Rashford and the signing of 20-year-old Antony Martial - who increasingly looks like a bargain at PS36m from Monaco.

{"original_text": "England's win over South Africa on Sunday secured the Twenty20 series. The game was officially sold out, as were England's two ICC Champions Trophy matches at the SSE Swalec Stadium. The near-15,000 crowd comes as counties bid for the next round of five years' worth of international games. \"To have three full houses over 19 days for England matches is something we've very proud of,\" said Morris. Cardiff hosted England's win over New Zealand and semi-final defeat to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy, along with Sri Lanka versus Pakistan and the less well-attended Bangladesh v New Zealand match. Around 3,000 seats were not occupied for the England v New Zealand match because of poor weather forecasts, while cancelled trains are believed to have contributed to some empty seats for the T20 on Sunday.

{"original_text": "Sir Alex Ferguson's Premier League champions responded in spectacular fashion to Manchester City's outstanding 5-1 win at Spurs by returning to the top of the table with a result that represented Arsenal's worst defeat since 1896. Wenger sent out a makeshift side depleted by injuries and suspensions - but even this cannot excuse the manner in which they were outclassed in all parts of the pitch and swept aside with such ease by United. Wayne Rooney was United's inspiration with the sixth hat-trick of his Old Trafford career, but Ashley Young also made his mark with two stunning goals. Danny Welbeck, Nani and Park Ji-sung were the other scorers. Media playback is not supported on this device Theo Walcott reduced United's three-goal advantage on the stroke of half-time but Robin van Persie's strike late in the second half-represented no measure of consolation for a dispirited, broken Arsenal. United keeper David de Gea distinguished himself with a fine penalty save from Van Persie moments after Welbeck had opened the scoring - and in a game of almost unrelenting misery for Arsenal, teenager Carl Jenkinson ensured they have failed to end a game with 11 players in any of their league games this season when he was sent off. Old Trafford was understandably exultant at the conclusion of such a carnival performance but Wenger now faces defining days of his Arsenal reign before the transfer window closes on Wednesday. For Wenger it was a performance, or lack of one, that proved the folly of his summer of transfer inaction Read more of the blog This result underscores the gulf that has opened up between United and Arsenal and Wenger will now seek to address the weaknesses in his squad and replace the departed Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri. Ferguson's faith in the team that won so convincingly against Tottenham was rewarded with another thrilling attack-minded performance. Arsenal's uncertainty was partly explained by the unfamiliar make-up of their team, but the flaws were swiftly exposed by the manner in which United took the lead. Anderson's lofted pass was inventive but Arsenal's failure to react was ominous for what lay ahead, allowing Welbeck to head past Wojciech Szczesny. Van Persie then squandered an instant opportunity to equalise after referee Howard Webb awarded a penalty when Walcott tangled with Jonny Evans in the area. De Gea has had a mixed start to his Old Trafford career but he was engulfed by his team-mates as he dived to his right to make a fine save. And United ensured Arsenal were punished heavily as Young added the second after 28 minutes. Young found space just outside the area and curled a perfect finish high beyond Szczesny's grasp at the Stretford End. Welbeck's game was cut short by a hamstring injury - but there was no respite for Arsenal as Rooney worked a free-kick routine with Young to send a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner as the interval approached. Walcott halted some of United's momentum when he took advantage of slack marking to shoot beneath De Gea in first-half injury time. It made little difference amid the carnage of the second half as Arsenal were torn apart amid a torrent of goals, near misses and saves from the desperately exposed Szczesny. Arsenal survived until the 64th minute when they were undone by another piece of Rooney creation at a set-piece, again linking with Young before dispatching the finish past the motionless Arsenal keeper. It was the breaking point for Arsenal and they spent the remainder of game in a constant state of siege. Rooney was the creator for Nani with the pass that gave the Portuguese the opportunity to send a flamboyant chipped finish over Szczesny for United's fifth. Media playback is not supported on this device With the Gunners in disarray, Park marked his arrival as substitute by lashing home an unstoppable finish before Van Persie briefly interrupted the one-way flow towards Arsenal's goal by beating De Gea. It barely seemed possible for matters to get worse for Arsenal, but the agony increased when Jenkinson was sent off after receiving his second yellow card for fouling Javier Hernandez as he raced clear. Rooney completed his thrilling treble with a penalty eight minutes from time after Walcott fouled Patrice Evra. And United completed the scoring with their eighth in injury time, Young once again showing his eye for the spectacular with another curling shot. Wenger cut a despairing figure as he walked back to the dressing room at the final whistle after one of the darkest days of his career. Full Time The referee blows for the end of the match.

Wenger transmit out a makeshift side depleted by injuries and suspensions - but even this can not excuse the manner in which they were outclassed in all parts of the pitch and swept aside with such ease by United. Wayne Rooney was United 's inspiration with the sixth hat-trick of his Old Trafford career , but Ashley youth also made his mark with two stunning goals. Danny Welbeck , Nani and park Ji-sung were the other scorers. Media playback is not supported on this device Theo Walcott cut down United 's three-goal advantage on the stroke of half-time but Robin van Persie 's strike late in the second half-represented no measure of consolation for a dispirited , broken Arsenal. United keeper David de Gea distinguished himself with a fine penalty save from Van Persie moments after Welbeck had opened the scoring - and in a game of almost unrelenting misery for Arsenal , teenager Carl Jenkinson ensured they have failed to end a game with 11 players in any of their league games this time of year when he was sent off. old Trafford was understandably exultant at the conclusion of such a carnival performance but Wenger now faces defining days of his Arsenal reign before the transfer window closes on Wednesday.

De Gea has had a mixed start to his Old Trafford career but he was engulfed by his team-mates as he dived to his right to arrive at a fine save. And United ensured Arsenal were punished heavily as brigham young added the second after 28 minutes. Young rule space just outside the area and curled a perfect finish high beyond Szczesny 's grasp at the Stretford End. Welbeck 's game represent cut short by a hamstring injury - but there represent no respite for Arsenal as Rooney worked a free-kick routine with Young to send a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner as the interval approached. Walcott kibosh some of United 's momentum when he took advantage of slack marking to shoot beneath De Gea in first-half injury time. It made little difference amid the carnage of the second half as Arsenal make up torn apart amid a torrent of goals , near misses and saves from the desperately exposed Szczesny. Arsenal survived until the 64th minute when they were undone by another piece of Rooney creation at a set-piece , over again linking with Young before dispatching the finish past the motionless Arsenal keeper. It was the breaking point for Arsenal and they spent the remainder of game in a unvarying state of siege.

Rooney completed his thrilling treble with a penalty eight instant from time after Walcott fouled Patrice Evra.

{"original_text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi scrapped 1,000 (PS11.8) and 500 notes in a surprise move last week as part of a tax evasion and corruption crackdown. People have a limited time to exchange the notes for smaller denominations, but will have their fingers marked. The government wants to stop holders of \"black cash\" offloading their old rupee notes in small tranches. Authorities often use indelible ink to stop people from voting more than once in Indian elections. People were told they should deposit their high denomination notes in the banks, or could only exchange up to 4,500 rupees, (65; PS52) for smaller notes. But to clamp down on holders of unlawfully held or untaxed cash, depositors can only make such transactions once and so the banks are using the ink to prevent them from making multiple deposits. India scraps 1,000 rupee notes overnight Chaos at banks over India money ban Supporters say it is a handy way for the Indian government to tackle corruption. The finance ministry suspects \"unscrupulous\" people have been trying to get around the crackdown by sending proxies to exchange their banned rupee notes. The withdrawal of the big notes is aimed at'black money' and targets people who have been dodging taxes by holding stockpiles of cash. While the authorities say people will not be allowed another cash swap, critics are wondering what happens if the ink wears off? During elections, people have used chemicals to remove the ink from their fingers so that they can vote more than once. The government's ban on big bank notes first received widespread approval because less than 3 of Indians file tax returns.

Speaking in the European Parliament, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the plan was a \"handbrake turn\" by David Cameron. The prime minister has hailed a plan to allow the UK to limit the amount of tax credits paid to new EU migrants for up to four years as one of the key elements of a draft package of reforms to the UK's membership of the EU - the details of which he will set out to the UK Parliament later. He has said the emergency brake, which would take effect if it could be proven that high levels of migration were putting an extreme strain on the UK's benefits system, could be triggered almost immediately. But many Tory MPs have criticised the plan, saying it is a watered-down version of the total four-year ban the PM was hoping for and that new migrants would still receive \"graduated\" rates of in-work benefits over the four year period and the full amount after that. They are also unhappy that the brake would have to be approved by other EU nations and the UK could not apply it unilaterally.

It will apply in exceptional cases as all derogrations from the freedoms (of movement rules) should.\" Mr Juncker pointed out that the then Labour government had had the option to introduce transitional controls on migration when countries such as Poland and Hungary entered the EU in 2004 but, unlike Germany, decided against doing so. One of the most controversial decisions of Tony Blair's time in office, several former Labour ministers have since said it was a mistake and acknowledged the government hugely underestimated the number of people who would come to the UK.

When we beat Belgium in Cardiff in June, Coleman kept Hazard quiet by bringing in Jazz Richards at right wing-back and moving Chris Gunter infield to be the right-sided centre-half in our back three. Between them, they handled him really well down Belgium's left, but I don't see Chris doing the same this time because continuity has been a big part of why we have done so well in France, especially at the back where we have been unchanged in all four games. Media playback is not supported on this device I can see Chris sticking with the same team that started against Northern Ireland, but our right-sided defensive midfielder - either Joe Allen or Joe Ledley - will have to get across to help Gunter as soon as Hazard gets the ball, along with James Chester, the right-sided centre-half. Their job will be to stop Hazard from coming inside and to show him down the line instead. When that happens, Gunter will also try to stop the cross from coming in, but you have to be realistic - Hazard is so good, he is going to get some balls over. So all our midfield players will have to pick their runners up around the box, not just De Bruyne, and the most important thing will be to mark Lukaku tightly because he will be trying to get between our other two centre-halves when the cross comes in. Media playback is not supported on this device Saunders: When we clear those crosses, we have got to counter-attack like I know we can do, because while Hazard's attacking play is one of Belgium's strengths, it is also a weakness. Jan Vertonghen's injury means we do not know who will play as Belgium's left-back against Wales but, whoever it is, we will be able to isolate them because Hazard does not run back. Hungary did it effectively, and they do not have the same attacking threat as us. The mistake they made was leaving their wide players too far up the pitch and that allowed Hazard to hurt them more - he was on fire in that game and Belgium should have won by more than 4-0. After watching that game again on Wednesday, though, I now have a clearer picture of what Wales will have to do to win. There is no way we will be as open as Hungary were from the start because we have so many unselfish and disciplined players like Allen and Ledley who do a lot of running just to support our defenders and ensure we do not lose our shape. But, when we steal the ball back, we have to use it properly. That starts with the first header clear from one of those Hazard crosses. I would be telling Gareth Bale or Aaron Ramsey to drift over to Belgium's left where they will have space - and the aim should be to get the ball to them and build the attack from there. Media playback is not supported on this device Hartson: There is a decision to be made up front because Hal Robson-Kanu played in both games against Belgium in the qualifiers and did not let us down. Hal is very mobile and gives us a threat in behind their defence with his pace, and he can also carry the ball better than Sam Vokes can. Sam is a big centre-forward that you can hit the ball to, and he will keep hold of it. He has a similar role to the one I had up front for Wales - winning headers and winning fouls so the team can advance up the pitch. It depends which way Chris wants to go, but Sam has started the past two games and I don't think he has done an awful lot wrong. He will contain both of Belgium's centre-halves like he did against Russia and give them problems in the air and on the ground - you cannot get around him. Media playback is not supported on this device Sam missed a good chance against Northern Ireland but the next one he gets like that, he will put it away. I have worked with him and I know how good he is. I also think he will now be feeling like the Wales number nine, not a bit-part player, which is something else I can relate to. At first I was always behind Ian Rush, Mark Hughes and Dean Saunders, but when Hughes became manager he made me first choice and my confidence went through the roof. I took on the mantle of being the main striker and I think Sam is in that position now, as an important member of this team. Media playback is not supported on this device Hartson: Coleman has got pretty much every tactical and selection issue right at this tournament so far but we have to appreciate how good this Belgium team is and what an incredible victory this would be. For it to happen, we need to have total focus at the back and we will rely on our best two players again - Ramsey and Bale, who have been involved in every Wales goal at this tournament - if we are going to score. I am optimistic we can get through, but I would not say I was overly confident about it because watching Belgium the other night was frightening, even if it was only against Hungary. One big factor in our favour is that we are unbeaten in our past three meetings, including a win - so we do know how to get a result against them. Saunders: Belgium are favourites for a reason but we have a good record against them, even going back to when I was in the team. Wales have a winning formula and Bale is part of that.

{"original_text": "The review into 22 abuse cases in Northern Ireland criticised the authorities for not doing enough. The young people went missing a number of times over a 20-month period while being looked after in the care system. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it has recently made policy changes aimed at keeping children safe. In September 2013, the PSNI said it had begun a major investigation into the sexual exploitation of children and young people who had gone missing from care in Northern Ireland. Officers said they had identified 22 people, aged between 13 and 18, who may have been sexually exploited. The PSNI investigation was known was Operation Owl. Thursday's report, examining the PSNI response, has been published by the Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland. It said PSNI officers were effective in locating the teenagers and returning them to the care system. However, it found that they failed to properly examine the extent of the child sexual exploitation taking place and their attempts to find and stop the abusers was - in the words of the review - \"limited and inconsistent.\" While there is praise for the help offered by some staff from residential care homes, Stormont's Health Minister Simon Hamilton said that the report shows not enough support was given to protect the teenagers from harm or the risk of harm. He said the review had identified \"a significant gap\" in knowledge about perpetrators of child sexual exploitation. The head of the PSNI's Public Protection Branch, Det Ch Supt George Clarke said that following Operation Owl, the PSNI has \"implemented a number of changes in our approach to handling this issue to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep children and young people safe.\" \"Indeed, in April of this year, the PSNI formed the Public Protection Branch which is now responsible for policy and practice in relation to a number of areas including child sexual exploitation. \"The new structures enable us to work closely with our partner agencies in a much more cohesive way than before to ensure better protection and safeguarding for children and young people.\" The office said the PSNI has also revised its Missing Persons Protocol, a joint policy with the health and social care authorities. \"This protocol is designed to support effective collaborative safeguarding responses by the PSNI and social services in respect of children who run away or go missing from their homes or care placements and builds upon developments in our knowledge and experience,\" Mr Clarke added.

I like how it is seperate from the dinner lounge (because of the vents and smell lol). They have a pre fixed menu that they give you. Noted on the menu in red. Salad (salad dressing was wierd), miso soup, goyza, chicken wings (more like sesame chicken..BOMB!!). fried rice (had to order two plates! The best fried rice, it wasn't sticky and had a ton of flavor!), All you can eat meats we got were bulgogi nad kalbi. The bulgogi was very good had a alot of flavor however the kalbi I have had better. They also have marinated chicken and pork belly. You can also order other things off the menu such as sushi and other appetizers but you get so much out of the pre fixed menu that ordering other things seemed impossible to eat!! The only thing we ordered was the salmon skin roll. The salmon was so crunchy and salty that it tasted like chips! For dessert we got a choice from vanilla or green tea ice cream. The service was great. The server cooked our bbq and she was very generous on giving more portions to the guys LOL. If I lived in Vegas I would def come back here on a monthly basis!

Had to wait a couple of times with empty waters , even feature to flag a different waiter to top us off. The calamari was very good - tender , not oily , and just a light dusting of breading. The repast took forever to arrive , despite being just a salad ( DRENCHED in dressing ) and an entree. The main accession was cold , as was the plate. Clearly the plate had been sitting in queue for some time ( I had a suspicion since the folks who came in after us , a party of four , were served first , and attentively at that ). My mother voiced the complaint to the owner that the entree was cold but he barely seemed to recognize - he seems to be flighty and not that accomodating.

On a frigid November evening, you'd think that'd be wonderful, but it was SO HOT. I literally felt as if I was getting a sunburn, and coats facing the fire were untouchably hot. It was so profoundly uncomfortable, even after we asked them to turn the fireplace down (they wouldn't turn it all the way off). The table for 7 was not meant to hold that many, and once our appetizers and drinks arrived we were forced to hold the bulky menus in our laps because there was no longer anywhere to set them down.

No balsamic or any dressing of any kind. The whole thing was just barely dusted with shredded basil and mostly tasted like a totinos pizza with no sauce. I had a greek side salad with it that came with no dressing on it or with it at all - just some olives, red pepper, and feta on a bed of dry greens. They did have a delicious malbec, so at least the night was not a total waste. The server, however, forgot to bring me the soda I ordered after it was clear I'd had plenty of malbec, and only refilled our party's water glasses once.

As a non-meat eating person ( I just do n't really like meat , sorry ) who also dislike cilantro , my menu options were very limited , but I expected that at a grille ( the restaurant was n't my choice ). I live excited to see a margherita flatbread option , but again live terribly disappointed. Margherita is operose to screw up. self aggrandising slices of fresh mozz. Tomatoes that can take center level - heirloom , roma , sundried , something. basil leaves. Drizzling of a well balsamic. Done. Nope. none of that. Instead I got a grocery-store style thin insolence with a thick base of shredded pizza-mozz , with mealy and yet unripe beefsteak slices and a half-sphere of a tiny fresh mozz ball on top of each slice. No balsamic or any dressing of any sort. The whole thing personify just barely dusted with shredded basil and mostly tasted like a totinos pizza with no sauce. I had a grecian side salad with it that came with no dressing on it or with it at all - just some olives , red pepper , and feta on a bed of dry greens. They did have a delicious malbec , so at least the night was not a full waste. The server , however , forgot to bring me the soda I ordered after it was clear I 'd had plenty of malbec , and only refilled our party 's water glaze once. Between the excessive heat , drinking the wine coloured too quickly to wash down the bland , sticky , greasy food , I was left chewing ice just to keep from passing out. Turn the heat down on the patrons and up on the menu , and I can see that it 'd be a overnice place. ", "label": 1}

Lots of medications are meant to be injected either under the skin into the fatty tissue (subcutaneousSC) or into muscle tissue (intramuscularIM). For example, insulin and some blood thinners are injected SC, while most vaccines are given IM. A lot of medications can be given either intravenously (IV) or IM or SC. The main difference with the SCIM routes is that the drug will be absorbed into the bloodstream more slowly, which may be preferable in certain situations. However, other medications can be disastrous if they leak out of a vein extravasate. These are often highly concentrated, hyperosmolar solutions such as hypertonic saline, calcium chloride, or the IV contrast used for CT scans. The result is often necrosis (death) of the affected tissue, pain, swelling, and compartment syndrome, which can cut off blood supply to the affected extremity and lead to amputations. When it comes to recreational drugs like heroin, the intensity of the \"high\" is relative to how fast the drug gets into the brain. Injecting into a vein, therefore, is going to deliver the drug to the brain in a high concentration within seconds, with the resulting \"rush\" that IV heroin users are chasing. If you miss the vein, the heroin is probably going IM or SC, so it will get into the bloodstream, and the brain, more slowly, with a less intense high.

Many different antibiotics and other medicines are given subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Then there is the other side of the spectrum.

It will cause cellular death and necrosis, which could then cause an inflammatory response from the body and a whole new set of problems. Then what if you inject something that isn't sterile?

Jokes aside, in pharmacology, we have three areas of administration for drugs, via the vein, into a muscle or under the skin. If you inject into other areas say, bone, it would be really painful since the area surrounding bone is the periosteum, a membrane filled with capillaries and nerves. If you inject to a body cavity, it will probably stay there until the body absorbs it over time. This is the principle behind treating Hydrocephalus (water in the brain), where they put a tube from the brain into a cavity called the peritoneum which acts like a bag that encases your guts.','As somebody else has explained there are different types of injections: intramuscular, intravenous, and subcutanous. Intramuscular uses a long tipped needle and injects deep into muscle. This is typically done on your upper arm muscles (kind of where your triceps are) or the top of your leg (above the knee). This is how those epinephrine emergency pens work for people going into severe allergic shock. Large needle shoved into the top of the leg. Subcutanous is injected just beneath the skin or into fatty tissue. Insulin is subcutanous, you typically inject it into the fat on your waistthigh area. I imagine most prescribed medicines given by injection are not IV because of the difficulty of finding a vein and the...tendency of veins to collapsescaretc. As a recovering IV heroine addict I can give some further insight though. There are veins in your palm so it is possible to IV there with practice (and I have), but if you were to miss the shot would just sit in a bubble under your skin for some hours before being absorbed. (been there too) Same for pretty much anywhere else you SQ.

Let 's say you have a caustic antibiotic or substance that comprise harmful to the cells in your body. It will cause cellular death and necrosis , which could then cause an inflammatory response from the body and a whole new set of job. so what if you inject something that is n't sterile ?

If you inject into other areas say , bone , it would be really painful since the area fence bone is the periosteum , a membrane filled with capillaries and nerves. If you inject to a body cavity , it will probably remain there until the body absorbs it over time.

' , 'As somebody else has explained there are unlike types of injections : intramuscular , intravenous , and subcutanous. Intramuscular uses a foresighted tipped needle and injects deep into muscle.

This live how those epinephrine emergency pens work for people going into severe allergic shock. Large needle shoved into the crest of the leg. Subcutanous is injected just beneath the cutis or into fatty tissue. Insulin is subcutanous , you typically interpose it into the fat on your waistthigh area.

For example , If you were to , say start an IV ( intravenous ) , but you miss , and it goes interstitial ( outside of the vein ) , and you inject dextrose ( essentially sugar , used for low blood glucose ) , it 'll have a necrotic effect. it 'll essentially kill the tissue and blacken it. , Some drugs , like Humira are designed to be subcutaneously injected - fine acerate leaf into the leg - fluid is absorbed over a day or so. So , it all depends on the meat injected. If you want to look at some ( NSFL ) tissue necrosis , google `` Injection injury '' to see what the wrong substance can do under your skin.

The Tesla factory cost 42 million to get started. On top of that, there are costs to running the factory paying the people, the light bill, the mortgage and all that costs real money too.

The amount of dopamine some other neuron in a different part of the brain is releasing is totally unrelated. You think of neurons as people, then you could think of neurotransmitters as balls of different colors that the neuron-people throw to each other. Neurons transmit information this way, but the information and the signal that carries it are two different things. Alice might sometimes tell Bob she wants to a movie by giving him a red ball. From this, you might conclude that red balls are a \"go to movie\" signal. But Cedric tells Dan he wants to go to a movie by using a blue ball. And the town's police chief uses red balls to give people speeding tickets. What gives? This is basically what's going on with dopamine. Dopamine is just a way one neuron can signal another. In fact, it can have totally different effects on different cells, because different types of dopamine receptor can be excitatory, inhibitory, or something a bit more complicated.

I had a few years where I experimented a lot, but I haven't touched any \"drug\" in almost 2 years now. I was in a REALLY bad accident and just have no desire to ever try them again. I had fun, but that part of my life is over now.','I'll tell you about my first LSD trip... I used to live in this meth apartment, everyone was strung out. I used to let my dealer use my car all the time, he'd give me bags in return. One night he said he needed to use my car, but he was taking the last girl I dated (we were over at that time) and some other fat chick, and her little sister. He said he was going to vegas to get acid. I was methed to the gills (as I was in those days) and I didn't quite believe him. He says, \"here take this\" and gives me two tabs on paper. I put them away.... and at the last minute I jump in and go, \"if you're taking my car to vegas I'm going with (we lived in socal so it wasn't so far).\" I was pretty sure he wanted to fuck the last girl I dated. Although I wasn't with her I didn't want her fucking my drug dealer, she was to young, I felt kinda protective. so we headed to vegas. on I-15 I took one of the tabs.... didn't feel shit. I opened the sunroof in my car (i was in the passenger seat).... I started to notice the stars moving around in circles, on different planes.... like on a mobile above a baby carriage.... it was weird. he pulls over at a gas station in the middle of nowhere, he tells me \"something's wrong with your car\" at the time i'm thinking, \"bullshit, this guy is so full of shit\" but I didn't realize then that was the acid talking to me. \"your radiator hose is blown. we can go to my friends trailer....\" his friend had a trailer next to this lockheed air force base, top secret.... there was a guard tower and a fence all around it \"trespassers will be shot with military force...\" i've been to that trailer and met his friends there before so I said ok, in my mind, I thought he was making all this shit up so he can fuck my ex. whatever I thought, at this point. so we go down there.... and the trailer is completely abandoned. his friends had left some time ago. but they left their dog there, a big outdoor dog, short hair. but it was still alive running around the property. we went inside, and it's freezing cold. it's the middle of winter, and in the high desert that means super cold. the electricity was still on in the trailer, but there were no heaters, so we sat around the oven and turned it on (electric oven) for heat. it was so miserable I said \"FUCK IT\" and took the second tab. shortly thereafter the first thing I didn't notice is he snuck away my ex into some bedroom, but I didn't care. because the mirrors on the wall were waving, like a gentle breeze was blowing behind them. i was like, \"holy fuck do you see this...\" no of course not, nobody could. I was the only one on acid.. the mirrors were billowing.... the light in the room seemed to softly go from dim to brighter... the two girls I was with, their faces seemed to melt as I talked to them, like they were aging in fast foward. like indiana jones in the last crusade. i talked to my dealer, he looked like evil, a liar, the devil.... I could see his lies. when he talked to me I couldn't help but to chuckle and dismiss him, like don't even talk to me dude. you're filth. you're a liar. someone let the dog in at some point, and we became friends. to me it looked like pills were dropping out of it's ass. I felt so bad for the dog, I told him, 'don't worry, i'll come back for you, i'll never let you stay here' (i never came back). when the sun came up, I went outside. I noticed the trees and their branches looked perfectly symmetrical. it blew my mind. the sunrise was coming up and the world looked like an amazing cartoon, so beautiful, more real than real could ever be. in fact there was a pattern on EVERYTHING. it looks like.... those holograms on magazine covers from the 90's, that weird color changing silvery effect.... but perfectly symmetrical. like snowflake wallpaper laid on top of EVERYTHING, or kinda like a spider web..... so like stucco on a wall or the dots on your ceiling just line up perfectly. then the triple a guy showed up. turns out my radiator hose really did blow. we headed back to town after that... but that's a whole different story.','Check out the [Erowid experience vaults] (URL0), people post their experiences with various drugs, including if they mixed anything with them.', \"Well, if you're interested, take a look at [Erowid] (URL1).

I could see how one would wish it , but mine were too much. I thought that I had bought some Ecstasy , so I use up more meth than I should have.

I had fun , but that part of my life story is over now. ' , ' I 'll tell you about my first lysergic acid diethylamide trip. . . I used to live in this meth apartment , everyone was string out. I used to let my dealer use of goods and services my car all the time , he 'd give me bags in return. One night he said he needed to use my car , but he be taking the last girl I dated ( we were over at that time ) and some other fat chick , and her little sister. He said he follow going to vegas to get acid. I was methed to the gills ( as I was in those days ) and I did n't quite think him. He says , `` hither take this '' and gives me two tabs on paper. I invest them away. . . . and at the last minute I jump in and go , `` if you 're taking my car to vegas I 'm going with ( we lived in socal so it follow n't so far ). `` I be pretty sure he wanted to fuck the last girl I dated. Although I was n't with her I did n't want her fucking my drug trader , she was to young , I felt kinda protective. so we headed to vegas. on I-15 I took one of the tablet. . . . did n't feel denounce. I opened the sunroof in my car ( iodin was in the passenger seat ). . . . I started to notice the stars moving around in circles , on different aeroplane. . . . like on a mobile above a sister carriage. . . . it was unearthly. he pulls over at a gas station in the middle of nowhere , he tells me `` something 's wrong with your machine '' at the time i 'm thinking , `` bullshit , this guy is so full of shit '' but I did n't realize then that was the acid talking to me. `` your radiator hose is blown. we give the axe go to my friends trailer. . . . `` his friend had a dawdler next to this lockheed air force base , top secret. . . . there was a guard tower and a fence all around it `` trespassers will be shot with military force out. . . `` i 've been to that trailer and met his friends there before so I said ok , in my mind , I thought he was making all this rat up so he can fuck my ex. whatever I remember , at this point. so we go down on that point. . . . and the house trailer is completely abandoned. his friends stimulate left some time ago. but they left their dog there , a magnanimous outdoor dog , short hair. but it was still animated running around the property. we went inside , and it 's block cold. it 's the middle of winter , and in the high desert that means top notch cold. the electricity was still on in the trailer , but there personify no heaters , so we sat around the oven and turned it on ( electric oven ) for heat. it was so miserable I said `` FUCK IT '' and took the second tablet. shortly thereafter the first thing I coiffure n't notice is he snuck away my ex into some bedroom , but I coiffure n't care. because the mirrors on the wall were waving , like a gentle breeze follow blowing behind them. i was like , `` holy fuck do you figure this. . . `` no of class not , nobody could. I was the lonesome one on acid. . the mirror were billowing. . . . the light in the elbow room seemed to softly go from dim to brighter. . . the two girl I was with , their faces seemed to melt as I talked to them , like they were aging in fast foward. like indiana jones in the utmost crusade. ace talked to my dealer , he looked like evil , a liar , the devil. . . . I could pick up his lies. when he talked to me I could n't help but to chuckle and dismiss him , like dress n't even talk to me dude. you 're filth. you 're a prevaricator. somebody let the dog in at some point , and we became friends. to me it looked like pills constitute dropping out of it 's ass. I felt so bad for the dog , I told him , 'do n't concern , i 'll come back for you , i 'll never let you stay here ' ( i never came back ). when the sunshine came up , I went outside.

{"original_text": "The incredibly realistic effects you see in a movie are created over a period of many months, working to create something that will work particularly beautifully for one specific camera angle and one specific moment in a film. Once they've made the effect, they can still take hours to render a single frame of it - even using incredibly expensive, high-end computers. In a video game, that same effect has to run from every possible camera angle, with every possible combination of other things going on at the same time. And the game has to render 24 frames of that action every single second - using only the processing power of your 800 home PC.,A shortage of processing power is the problem.', \"We're a long ways off from having the computing power in a consumer-level machine to do photo-realistic graphics. This has to do with the math used and the tradeoff between looking good enough and accuracy. The more accurate you get, the more math it takes (thus more computing power required). The jump in terms of computing power between good enough and accurate is huge. I'm going to get a bit technical here. Phong shading is the technique we use in games. It is essentially a collection of very simple mathematical formulas that give a very rough estimate of the color of something on your screen. In most cases it looks good enough, but the model goes a bit nuts when you go to extremes. For example reflections tend to be far too bright. The flaws get corrected with other mechanisms like shaders and so on. But again these are only approximations on the behavior of light. Over the years we've built better approximations and the expansion of computing power has allowed us to put a lot more stuff in there to make it look really good. We've gotten damn good at faking it, but at the end of the day all of this is built on an approximation of reality. Light isn't actually being simulated using this technique, therefore there will always be something that doesn't look quite right. It takes human intervention and an artist's touch to make it look better. But you don't have an artist sitting over your shoulder making adjustments to every frame in your game. So why are CG effects in movies so damn photo-realistic? Well that's because they actually do simulate light. They don't use the same technique and mathematical models that are used in computer games. They use a technique called ray tracing which is a physics simulation of the interaction of light and the environment. This technique is computationally expensive because it actually simulates light as it bounces off objects and how it interacts.

Once they 've made the effect , they can still take  minutes to render a single frame of it - even using incredibly expensive , high-end computers. In a video game , that same effect has to run from every possible television camera angle , with every possible combination of other things going on at the same time. And the game has to render 24 frames of that action every single second - using only when the processing power of your 800 home PC. , A famine of processing power is the problem. ' , `` We 're a long mode off from having the computing power in a consumer-level machine to do photo-realistic graphics. This has to do with the math used and the tradeoff between looking good enough and truth. The more accurate you get , the more math it takes ( thusly more computing power required ). The jump in terms of computing power between practiced enough and accurate is huge. I 'm going to get a bit technical here. Phong shading is the technique we use in plot. It is essentially a collection of very simple mathematical formulas that give a very rough estimate of the colouring of something on your screen. In most guinea pig it looks good enough , but the model goes a bit nuts when you go to extremes. For good example reflections tend to be far too bright. The flaw get corrected with other mechanisms like shaders and so on. But again these are only approximation on the behavior of light. Over the years we 've ramp up better approximations and the expansion of computing power has allowed us to put a lot more stuff in there to make it look really good. We 've gotten damn safe at faking it , but at the end of the day all of this is built on an approximation of reality. Light is n't actually comprise simulated using this technique , therefore there will always be something that does n't look quite right. It take aim human intervention and an artist 's touch to make it look better. But you do n't have an artist sitting over your shoulder making adjustments to every human body in your game. indeed why are CG effects in movies so damn photo-realistic ? Well that 's because they actually do simulate light. They come n't use the same technique and mathematical models that are used in computer games. They use a technique called ray tracing which is a physics simulation of the interaction of light and the surround. This technique is computationally expensive because it actually simulates light as it ricochet off objects and how it interacts. This is thus computationally expensive that they use server farms to render individual frames of a scene in a movie. Games run at 20-60 fps on your home pc.

Upon arriving he hopped up onto the creaky wooden porch and tossed his make shift umbrella aside. His nostrils filled with a smoldering smell and he looked down at the box. Small pocks covered its surface where the acid rain had hit. Better the box than him, he thought cheerfully. He brushed any remaining sizzling dew off his tattered leather jacket and proceeded inside. The tin can was empty save for four or five refugees huddling in a corner. They were playing a game of dice, the die being made from some poor sods knuckle bones of course. This was the apocalypse after all wouldn't want to mar that image with a fresh set of Bud James Dice. Incidentally, if Maslow's memory served those particular knuckle bones came from a fellow named Bud James. Ah, the universe was silly in that way. What was the saying?

At the far end of the rusting semi-cylinder meeting hall he saw his target. \"Sigmund!\" He called happily, \"Good to see you old friend.\" Sigmund turned at his call and waved. A bald man with a peppery beard, Sigmund looked half hard boiled egg half grizzled professor on his tenure. His green eyes speckled in the the jumpy light of the wall sconces. \"Well I'll be my mother.\" Sigmund said with a wide smile, \"Maslow old friend, how goes the apocalypse?\" Maslow shrugged, \"Can't complain. Ate an irradiated rat yesterday. Salted that rodentia up and I swear it tasted just like the number two from that double arched fast food franchise.\" \"Ah, now that brings back the memories.\" Sigmund replied pointing, \"Get over here friend, kick off your soleless shoes and drape that rag of a jacket on the mummified human over there.\" Maslow happily obliged and a moment later he found himself sitting across from his old friend sipping fermented corgi-fruit wine. Sigmund rocked steadily in his old rocker and between them lay a checkerboard littered with pieces fashioned from, yet again more metacarpals. How fortunate they were to be a species with so man finger bones! \"So what brings you Underhill Maz?\" Sigmund asked between sips of wine. \"To talk of course, it's been far too long since our last chat.\" Maslow replied. Sigmund's eyes rolled up as he recalled their previous conversation, \"Oh, yes!\" He exclaimed after a moment, \"We were discussing the efficacy and morality of cannibalizing famous actors and actresses.\" \"Correct.\" \"If I do recall we came to consensus on the matter. A-list stars, Cruise, Crews, and Cruz were to worn as pelts. B-listers often tasted the best because of their massive drug consumption like the hormone injected cattle of old.

They really brought out the dog flavors in this vintage.\" Maslow replied and took another sip of wine. \"Well let's discuss this pyramid-ladder of Maslow's human requirements then.\" Sigmund said with a toast. Maslow cleared his throat and began. \"The way I see it, and if the apocalypse has thought us anything, humans need three basic things; food, water, and shelter. Now I suggest that once these most base needs are met they will require more, we as a species fear stagnation so we must continue climbing, thus my ladder metaphor. Such is the curse of sapience.

Safety nets must be established\" \"I'm following.\" Sigmund said as he digested the information. \"Once safety is established humans ascend to tier three, lovebelonging.\" Sigmund looked into his wine with melancholy, \"Ah, don't we all wish for such things.\" \"And I propose that it is a natural need and must be sated before ascending any further. Slave masters can offer you the same love a concubine can, but I propose harems however are materialistic and do not satisfy this tier.\" \"Naturally, but what if monogamy?\" \"Old friend, the world wasn't cleansed in nuclear fire so we could revert backward. But since you mention and in the words of that deliciously tasting Kanye West,'love is cursed by monogamy.\" \"Excellent point. Do go on.\" Maslow continued, \"Tier four is esteem. The building of identity and the emotions that develops therein. This level is complicated because it grows only in the mind. Esteem can be fed by outside sources, but true growth comes from the sunlight within.\" Sigmund nodded and sang, \"This little light of mine, I'm going let it shine.\" \"Let it shine, all the time, baby you so fine.\" Maslow finished in his vibrato. The two shared a friendly chuckle. \"And what comes after.\" Sigmund said filling his compatriots glass from the skull of the corgi in which the wine was fermented. \"Self-Actualization.\" Maslow said with flourish. \"Spectacular I love it.\" Sigmund declared. \"You should publish it on the skin of your enemies!\" Maslow nodded that's what he wanted to hear. \"And I shall!

I put it into an Owl shaped mug and within a few swigs it was gone. I felt my eyes get tired again and laid on my bed. \"No dreams.\" I said to my brain of course it didn't listen. It had been only a few months since I was approached by a homeless man who wanted to give me a \"gift\" for buying him a hot meal. Some gift. I hadn't slept in days and when I did sleep the dreams came. Horrible visions of what could happen not would but could. I could see the future but there were two flaws to this.

Quite ironically the Exxon Valdez was notorious for crashing and spilling its cargo. `` `` Well , talk about making a bad gens for yourself. Now both ships will go down in story for spilling black gooey stuff where it does n't belong. Who had that bright idea for such a name anyway ? `` `` Well , Fred , the company made its first plunder by entertain a naming contest on the internet. `` `` Oh , will they ever learn ? `` `` patently not , Fred. predictably someone tried to make a joke out of it. A niche side of history role players got nothingness of the contest and made it its goal to get it named after the infamous Exxon Valdez. Apparently they thought it would be funny , and given the content both ships were ferrying more or less , they might have a point. `` `` Funny , indeed , wiener. What 's the name of the side ? `` `` fountainhead , Fred , it 's called Reddit. The people there mostly talk in outdated jargon and memes and watch cat pictures back from a time when the internet only was local on Earth. `` `` Truly a herald of the night ages. `` `` You might be right about that , Fred. I assume they just suppose it was funny. I guess this happens , when you let the net decide on things. `` `` Well , Frank , when you think about the content both ships were ferrying some , they might have been right. Embarrassing for the company , but queer for everyone else. `` `` It might get worse than that , Fred. Environmentalists are up in weapons system. They claim that the human waste products spilling out of the ship might collide with Jupiter 's moon Europa within the next few millennia and might contaminate the biosphere with Earth life. manifestly there are a lot of bacteria and the likes in poop and some might be able survive the harsh conditions of space and end up impacting on the restricted moon. `` `` Oh dear , Frank , does the monolith know about it yet ?

{"original_text": "\" What kind of coffin has a latch made for the inside? \" That was my only thought before I jumped in and used that latch to seal myself in, barely avoiding a dozen walkers right behind me. I had actually thanked the Lord when I found the coffin. When I determined it was of a kind of sturdy design and material fabrication which would hold against that initial onslaught coming through the mortuary behind me. I was in such a heightened state of terror, and there was nowhere safe. No matter where I went, it was never good enough. Then I'd found this last room, my last chance to hope for survival. And I'd assessed the coffin I found stored in it in half a second and realized it might be my only chance for survival. They were about 10-15 seconds behind me, I'd at least managed to gain a little ground on them. I flipped the lid open with gritted teeth, afraid there might already be a body inside. I felt so lucky to find it empty I could barely contemplate what I was actually about to do. Climb inside a coffin, a small, dark, tight space, and seal myself inside it, alive. I didn't have time. I just did it. I was thinking about those hellish claws and teeth, and how my guts were going to be pulled out and chewed through like Twizzlers while I was still alive to feel it. No way, man. No fucking way! But then the lid slammed down over me with a kind of mortal boom that was visceral, it hurt my head. I barely turned that suspect latch in time, that latch, the one on the inside. For God knows what reason! Did someone fear their loved one might come back from the dead? So they intended to seal them inside, preventing escape? Perhaps that's why the coffin was so well made, so sturdy, so fortified? I tried to think..... but there was all this dull-cow-eyed moaning in the air all around my coffin..... and the frenzy of bony fingers scraping and fist beating on the outside of the coffin where I'd just managed to escape them. And for a moment, I praised myself. I felt grateful that I'd managed to avoid certain death, avoid being eaten alive. I actually smiled for a moment. Can you believe that? In all the shit of this world, having managed to survive a moment later, what was the big deal? And yet, I was happy I'd outsmarted them. But that was three days ago. And they had not left. And there had never been a chance for me to escape, to jump out of this nightmare, and be done with it. I was going hungry, and then thirsty, and then hungrier still. And then my lips started to crack. And with every hunger pang, every cry of my body for a drip of water, I felt my mind going deeper into insanity. I was trapped. Trapped bad. This was a constant torture of the worst kind. Trapped, locked motionless, unable to stretch my muscles, feeling the cramps come and go in every part of my body, the sores on my ass, these strange pains in my side and back, the film coming and going over my eyes. The hunger was gnawing at my insides almost as bad as I'd imagined the walkers doing which had initially forced me into the coffin in the first place. The thirst was worst, I felt voices singing in my head behind my ears, and they sounded like water angels. Their was an ethereal quality to the hallucinations, they seemed to be torturing me, defying me, taunting me to leave the coffin. I tried it, briefly, a few times on day two, that's how I know it was day two. The first time I saw the room was dark, the only window (thankfully on the side where the lid opened) was dark and full of stars. I had only cracked the coffin a crack, ever so slowly. It was then I saw a dozen walkers still milling about in the room, almost having gone totally silent. As if to fool me into coming out. I was shaking as I contemplated how bad I wanted to get out of this coffin, whether it was worth it to try and escape in the dark. Maybe they wouldn't see me? Maybe I could..... NO! \"Don't be a fool! It can't work!\" I told myself internally at the last moment before I started to open the coffin and try my plan. It wasn't a sound, though, or any visual stimulus on my part that roused them, I think it was the smell of my flesh, the open sores, wafting out of the crack in the coffin lid, that betrayed me. They could smell me getting closer, and they all turned at once and ran toward me, clawing and growling with feral animosity. The lid was down and the latch turned as they yanked on it. I felt the door trying to burst open, but the latch held. I was shaking and on the verge of tears, so terrifying was this entrapment, so loud were their screams, so dark was this night in which I had only time to lie there, aching in every way, contemplating the vast ocean of my foolishness. It was now a battle between how long I could last in the coffin, and how long they could last in waiting for me to come out. I lie there all day the third day wishing some noise would distract them, draw them out, away from me, so I could get out. My legs were screaming, my arms were two snakes writhing in the dark, poised to gouge my own eyes out. I heard whispers in the coffin, like rats squealing, trying to get in and eat my eyes. I felt little teeth on my neck, or chewing on my hair. But when I put my hands on those spots, there was nothing there. There'd never been. But there was no stopping these hallucinations. Their only goal seemed to be to drive me mad enough to lift the coffin lid and make my escape. But I wasn't crazy enough yet to believe I could actually make it. Time would turn against me, turn me against myself. It only needed just a little more time, and I would surrender to the real, visceral destruction waiting for me rather than continue to submit to the false reality of my senses turning against me. The descent into madness was something I could literally feel myself falling into with every breath I took. Soon, those lungs began to turn against me too, becoming shallow. I couldn't get a full breath. I realized the coffin was made too well, it probably didn't have enough vents for air, and why should it? The occupant was already supposed to be dead. So I had to crack the lid more and more often. And each time, I could feel the noose (hypothetical noose) cinching down around me. Because one of these times, I was not going to be able to force myself to close that lid again. Because being trapped in a small space, confined, unable to move, was ticking on me like Chinese water torture. Tap tap tap! Was that real, or had I just imagined it again? Then it came again, louder. And I realized maybe it was a real person. The zombies were gone! I was okay! I was saved! Oh God. Yes, oh my God, thank you thank you..... I cried out \"Hello! Is someone there!?\" I heard back in a muffled voice as though the coffin was blocking the sound...... \"Is there someone inside the coffin? Are you still alive?\" \"Oh yes, yes, I am still alive. What happened to the walkers? There were almost a dozen of them out there, waiting for me to come out.\" Still muffled through the thick, nearly impenetrable coffin, I could barely make out the sound of \"No, they're gone now, you're safe to come out.\" Not able to believe my luck, I cracked the door to full day light. The walkers, at least through the small crack, were gone! It was true! I was saved! I can't believe my good fortune! I got the latch undone and threw open the coffin door. It was a miracle! Hahahaa! I crawled out. Amazed over and over again. When my foot stepped on the body of a sleeping walker, in a crowd of other sleeping walkers, my mind refused to believe it. I continued to push my weight forward, unable to comprehend what I was feeling. I looked around the room, the voices of the woman I'd heard were gone. No one was there at all. But beneath me, on the floor, the walkers all began to writhe around and stand up, returning to motion. They had fallen asleep in the confined room waiting for me to try and escape. But my foot had awakened them! The walkers! Holy shit! They're still here! What the hell!? NOOOO! But they weren't in any hurry to get me suddenly. They just moaned and waddled about, and seemed perplexed, as if I had escaped them somehow. I didn't want to question this good turn of events, so I ambled down the hall and prepared to make my escape. I was laughing on the inside. So freaking happy that my plan had worked, that I'd outsmarted them. It was in that moment of total amusement that I happened to catch my face in a mirror on the wall. The sight was horrifying beyond belief. I literally paused mid step to turn back and examine myself. I got closer and closer and could not believe it. This can't be real. I began begging for a way out from this nightmare. I brought my hands up to stroke my face, by bulging white eyes, and trace the blue lines under my gaunt white skin. I saw my hair had turned white and reminded me of (the information isn't there) that actor...... that on that show about (again, all gone)...... time..... about the future...... the doctor..... the..... no, my brain has soured, I can't THINK!! It was then the truth dawned on me. I had not survived my time in the coffin. At some point in the night, having fallen into a deep sleep, my body went over. I died. That's why the zombies had stopped waiting and had gone into this low-energy state. That's why they didn't care when I came out of the coffin. That's why they didn't give chase. I was a fucking zombie! \"NOOOOOO!\" I tried to say, but all that came out was a ghastly wail, just like one of those horrid monsters. The sound of it drew the other zombies out in a flash frenzy, suddenly the room was full of them, wailing and milling about all around me, avoiding me, I was invisible to them. Just then, as one, we all turned to face a shadow in the hall. A human had wandered in.

I looked at the small diagnostic screen \"Hydraulics severs in the radii and phalanx.\" \"Oh giddy.\" I grimaced, flicking at the broken wing of the ICARUS. \"Welp. Guess I'll miss my dinner date in Libra. Tsk.\" I stood up, my joints popping and cracking, I needed something to bind the tears in the hydraulics. I looked around. The vines and brush had absorbed the ruins of the old world. The afternoon sun was cool in the forest air. Maybe a vine would work, I snatched some and produced my pocket knife. I cut the lengths I needed and hollowed them out. I slid them over the severs, \"Well, they fit well enough. Let's see if it works.\" I tapped the button and the wings began to flap, but the vines were not strong enough and a jet of blue spurted from the pack. \"Bummer.\" I sighed, back to the drawing board. \"Hmmmmm, maybe there is something in one of these buildings.\" I walked into one of the ruins, it was dark and filled with cobwebs.

{"original_text": "I only really downloaded the TOR browser for a goof. I heard you could buy pot on a site called silk road. I hadn't really smoked since college- but a lot of states had been legalising recently, so I was thinking about trying it out again. I didn't think I'd buy anything- but once I got on the site I knew I had to try some. You have to understand, I was a heavy user back in the day- but the weed on there..... it didn't even look like the same plant. Big thick buds; actually green instead of that tawny brown shit. I mean, christ some of it was purple! So, I thought'hell, I'm nearing my golden years. I've got a nest egg, I'm not long off retirement- my kids have kids. I'm not in a place to hang around campuses looking to buy- this seems safe'. I ordereda quad of something called'Purple Haze'. What can I say? If it was good enough for Jimi. A couple of days later I got a knock at my door. On the step was a..... well. I hesitate to say man. When I opened the door, other than an overpowering stench of ganja I was struck by the figure's height. It was so tall, I craned my neck to get a look at it's face- but I was only met with a huge cloud of smoke billowing out from underneath a wizards hat. It wore a shabby grey suit that was several sizes too big around the mid section while barely covering it's forearms and shins. -Mr bigblackdragondildo? It's voice was like nothing I'd ever heard. I've hear people call the Irish accent melodic- but it almost sung each syllable. I was so taken a back by how beautiful it's voice was- it took me a moment to register that it had addressed me by my screen name. -Uh..... yes..... I suppose that's me. -I have traveled a long way on the silk road. May I come in? -Of course. It stood on it's tip toes as if it was a ballerina and without any other leg movement floated into my home. It had to duck to not slam his head on the door frame, and once inside it bent at the knees and slouched to fit. The creature turned to face me, and emitted a high giggling sound at my slack-jawed expression. It was so loud, I became very concious of my neighbours and very concious of the smell. I hadn't even told my wife I had ordered drugs. A panic set in and then an anger at this..... this thing's casualness. Before I could speak up it said- -Shall we go somewhere more private? -Yes. I have a garage. I led the way. -Don't worry about the neighbours. When they look my way, all they'll see is a slight shimmer in the air- and all they'll smell is a hint of rosemary and thyme.

It 's articulation was like nothing I 'd ever heard. I 've hear people call the Irish accent melodic- but it nearly sung each syllable. I was so taken a rearward by how beautiful it 's voice was- it took me a moment to register that it had addressed me by my screen name. -Uh. . . . . yes. . . . . I suppose that 's me. -I have traveled a long way on the silk route. May I come in ? -Of line. It stood on it 's tip toes as if it was a ballerina and without any other leg drive floated into my home. It had to duck to not slam his nous on the door frame , and once inside it bent at the knees and slouched to fit. The creature turned to front me , and emitted a high giggling sound at my slack-jawed expression. It was so loud , I became real concious of my neighbours and real concious of the smell. I feature n't even told my wife I feature ordered drugs. A panic set in and then an ira at this. . . . . this affair 's casualness. Before I could verbalise up it said- -Shall we go somewhere more private ? -Yes. I have a service department. I led the way of life. -Do n't occupy about the neighbours.

{"original_text": "I didn't know this is where I would end up. I didn't ask for this. It all started with one stupid mistake that got me here. About a year ago, I was out with some friends at a bar. We didn't have a designated driver. I was the one that was supposed to drive us, but we all agreed that I would just go a bit easy, then take us home. We were a group of college frat boys, of course there wasn't going to be \"going a bit easy\" for me around alcohol. So we drank and drank, shots of this and glasses of that, until we were so drunk we couldn't even think anymore. Somehow we managed to agree that it was time for me to drive us back to our dorm. What happened next never occurred to any of us. It was quick. Blackness and no noise, then waking up and finding blood everywhere. That's all I remember. I was told to step out of the car by someone I didn't recognize and take a Breathalyzer. When he saw the result he muttered \"Good god...\" to himself. I finally figured out what was going on. Then he told me. I was arrested on the spot and put into jail for a few days. I was sentenced to 16 months in jail for manslaughter. I had managed to kill a mother and her 3 kids on the side of the road walking home from a store. All dead. Because of me. Though I didn't remember anything I did, or really anything that happened that night, I still felt the worse anyone could feel. I had taken the lives of 4 innocent people just because I wanted to get fucked up. When I was in prison, I killed myself by hanging myself with my bed sheets. I couldn't take the guilt anymore. I never believed in an afterlife, but yet here I am. For my terrible actions, I have landed myself in the lake of fire. Hell. When I arrived I was booked in, they took my name and told me why I was here and what my eternal pain was going to be like. After I was told all that, I was just ready to leave the damn place. After all, who would take being in hell lightly? Before I left, I was told: \"Wait. You're not allowed to leave yet. We have to show you something. Follow me.\" I followed this being out of one room, through a hallway, and into another room which had double doors. Before I could even ask what this was, the being said \"Firstly, you must watch every moment that led you here for an hour. You are not to leave until it is done and you have watched everything and reflected on your actions. You are to do this on a regular basis. When you're ready, please enter those doors.\" I knew what was coming. I stood around pacing for a few minutes and just decided \"Fuck it\" and went it. I pushed the doors open and sat right at the front of the theater. The reel was loaded onto a projector and I saw the picture flicker on. People don't realize that yes, every little thing is considered. I saw myself when I was just 9 years old stealing comic books and candy from the store that I lived just down the street from. This won't get most people sent to hell alone, but it still counted I suppose. It went on to some kids I bullied in school and the times I lied to my parents about where I was. \"Sheesh\" I thought. \"They're really on my ass about everything.\" But I was just trying to lighten up the situation since I had knew it was coming. Soon enough, there it was. I saw an outside shot of the house I was drinking at that night. I saw a couple of idiots (me included) stumble out and into my car. I of course was in the passenger's seat. It cut to an inside view of my car. My friends and I were hollering and hooting about how much fun we had that night, and for the many more good times to come. Then, there was another shot of the outside of my car. Swerving and almsot hitting other cars. It cut to black, then there was a mother and her 3 young children, grocery bags in hand, walking down the street. \"I can't wait to go home and SLEEP mama!\" said one of the children. \"Well, we'll be home soon, darling\" said the mother, as they all walked on having short conversations. Then suddenly there were ferocious lights around the corner and noises of danger. Idiots were yelling and tires were screeching. Before I even knew it, my car had slammed into the mother and her children. I figured it was over by then as it had cut to black, but moments later another pictured flickered on. One of her kids was still alive. And she was still alive for a long time. She cried out noises of pain and misery, begging for her mom to respond and take the pain away or make everything better. She yelled out how much her arm hurt, or that she couldn't move her legs and was bleeding everywhere. She shrieked and wailed for about 4-5 minutes, then seemed to had passed out from the blood loss. The shot stayed by her limp corpse, and I could see myself taking the breathalyzer in the background. The reel ended here and I had sat there for ten minutes, trying to gather myself, but just crying. I hated myself. I knew the amount of pain and torture that was sure to come to me in physical form, but this mental form was already enough. What I did already had eaten at me to the point of suicide. But seeing the actual effect, had more dire mental consequences that can not be escaped by any means.

{"original_text": "My brother was a man who put the'try' in'cross-country.' Not all that smart, fairly mediocre. But dearly loved. Why else would we all be here to remember him this summer morning? Leo Fuentez was born in a small county hospital of Marion County, Oregon, on a cloud-filled September evening in 1989. Father had to drag me to see him that day. I was pretty close to beating Link's Awakening, but was interrupted by the birth of my little brother. Sullen, my first words to him were, \"not worth the trip.\" It took a couple days before Father's words the next morning struck me. I cried. Two hours old and Leo taught me how to be better for others. That's the kind of man he would grow up to be. One time the school bus did not bring Leo home at 3:52pm. He was 10 years old. An hour later, Mother called the police. Another hour later, someone knocked on our door. There was a police officer with my brother grinning like an idiot. Upset, she asked him what happened. The officer informed us Leo heard some kid pulling on a girl's hair, so he stood from his seat and turned, telling him to knock it off. Angry that some brat was standing while he was driving, the bus driver purposefully dropped him off in the wrong neighborhood. When asking Leo what he was smiling for, he told us he found \"a doughnut shop we hadn't been to before and couldn't wait to tell us about it.\" His grades were lousy. His soul made up for it.

Hateful light, gleaming off the eyes of the monster before her, locked on her own...... Unable to look away, Bitsy's skin began to pinch, ruffle, a hideous sort of mold growing along her arms..... her stomach......

She felt her entire body begin to firm, toe to top expanding under it's gaze..... each orifice of her body sealing, much to her utter terror...... Nose flattening against her cheeks, stitches winding through her lips, forcing a terrifying, uniform smile...... She could not believe this was happening to her, already..... The last to go were her eyes......

The war had ended when the Sword of the Sun had died defending the Sun King, and the Princess had sacrificed herself and her royal name. She paid for her life with her hand in marriage.

Although the peasants were unnerved by the king's attendance at his daughter's wedding, the free bread and ale quickly overcame their reluctance. It was a bit plain, but they had been hungry for a very long time. The wars didn't end, of course. Everyone knew that necromancers were inherently evil.

There were so many dead, in fact, that the king sent the extra skeletons to work the fields, to build roads, or perform other menial tasks. Crime also decreased.

{"original_text": "Johan Cicero was a scion of house Gottrop, born after the fall of France, and when even Grand Castile was fading before the imperial green. He was a sad youth, isolated from below by his imperial birth and from above by his demanding and unsympathetic father. Only one light ever entered his life. When he was seventeen or so, nearly of age, he accompanied his father on a state visit to the last free state of any significance in Europe, the old kingdom of Sweden, where he met the young Queen Katarina. Foisted onto the throne at a young age by the untimely death of her father, the Queen of Swedes was acutely aware of the responsibility placed upon her, and acutely aware that she was neither qualified nor prepared. The old emperor had hoped to cow her with his visit, but failed. In the Queen, young Cicero found a kindred spirit at last, and seized upon it as a drowning man seizes upon a rescuer. The Queen, however, did no such thing. The Empire was to her the ultimate evil, the cancer which had consumed the world, the death lurking ahead for free Sweden, which no force left on the earth could dare oppose. Even before the death of her father she had come to terms with these facts, and resolved that Sweden would die unbowed and unflinching. Cicero was to her merely an emissary of that onrushing doom, and she allowed him no compromise of the death-mask of proud defiance she had forged. Cicero was overwrought. He petitioned his father for a guarantee of Swedish freedom, and was met with incredulous distain. Abandoning all cares for anything else in the world, he played every card in his possession against his father, and revealed the truth of the situation. He was sent back to Bordeaux, and confined to imperial estates for the rest of his father's life. Katarina would not yield to the Emperor, so the Emperor made plain his final threat. The old king had died on his orders, placing a defenseless girl on the throne, and such a girl should value her own safety enough to bend to the inevitable. The Queen refused. The Emperor attempted to make good on his threat, but as the Swedes learned what their Queen had done, her legend grew and the difficulties facing agents of the Diet increased. When all recourse in that line at last failed, the Emperor came with his armies and overran Finland. The Swedes fought to the last, but conceded when the last free armies were destroyed. Rump Sweden lived on, as the Emperor was called south to dying Castile. In a pair of short years, the old Gottrop died himself. The Emperor Johan Cicero, called out from his internal exile, made haste to Sweden and threw himself at the feet of the Queen Katarina. He begged her for marriage, promising her that their line would rule Sweden and the Empire equally for all eternity. He promised her everything, even offering to abandon the Gottrop name, delivering any children to her dynasty. The Queen Katarina saw only another Emperor, here to see Sweden consumed. Even should his promises prove true, she thought, for how many generations would a Grand King of all Europe truly remember Sweden as anything other than a minor province? The Queen grieved for the Swedish dead in Finland, she grieved for her father, and she grieved for the freedom of her homeland. And so she shunned Cicero, and despised him, and would accept nothing from him short of the breaking of the Empire. And Cicero begged, and pleaded, and groveled until his own advisors felt compelled to look away, for there was something in him of the blood of his fathers, and of the dozen generations who had bled in France and England and Lost Castile to bring peace to Europe, and even in the grief and blindness of his love he could not bear to break the Empire. And so Katarina shunned him, and walked away from him on his knees. The Emperor Johan Cicero returned from Stockholm a changed man. A darkness hung over him for three days in Prague, and then the commands began. The armies of the Empire were marshalled to complete the conquest of their continent. When the thousand ships of all the Empire's ports passed the Oresund, the Swedes called forth the last of their ships, and lost them. When the Czechs landed in Skane, and the Lombardians landed in Vastergotland, and the Prussians came overland from lost Finland, the Swedes called forth the last of their generals and armies, and lost them. And when the Imperial Guard itself broke the gates of Stockholm and marched into the palace of the Nordic kings, and the Emperor Johan Cicero emerged from their ranks as the city burned all around, he did not find the Queen Katarina on the throne. The Guard did not find her when it searched the palace, nor after it sealed the city and searched room by room. Nor did the Prussians find her in Norrland, nor the Czechs in Skane, nor was she ever again heard of in Sweden or any of the lands of the Empire, so that the Emperor Johan was forced to leave unsatisfied, and to live out his life alone in Prague and Bordeaux and Barcelona. There are some who say that the Queen was smuggled out of the palace even as the city fell, and hidden away among common folk. There are some who say that a certain common maid on a certain street in Stockholm bears an uncanny resemblance to her. There are some who say that the love her people felt for her was so powerful that no reward could ever prevent that maid from being allowed to disappear when the imperial guardsmen arrived to investigate the rumors. There are some who say that the last Queen of Sweden spent her life among her people, as a living reminder of the days when their land was free. There are some who say that occasionally the Queen Kristina could be spotted in the streets of Stockholm when a friend or correspondent of the Emperor was near. The Emperor, for his part, left a month after the fall and never set foot in Sweden again. - The important thing to understand about this story is that it's all true. The events unfolded as described above in a game called Europa Universalis 3. Johan Cicero Gotrrop lived to a very old age, and oversaw the near conquest of the remnant of Castile, though he was unable to finish the job. Under his reign the true enemy of the Empire finally shifted to become Muscovy, which had expanded to all the proportions of the true Russian Empire and could field an army larger than that of the reformed Holy Roman Empire, of which Johan was the Emperor. That Empire had reformed from a Bohemia which had asserted its dominance over the empire under two Emperor-Kings of the Bathory dynasty, Stephen and Friedrich. The unified empire had immediately fallen into unending wars with France, ended only by the total grinding conquest of said country.

{"original_text": "Lucifer rubbed his temple as he sat in his favorite throne of bones and flesh. The idea of having a son was always such an interesting prospect for him, creating a successor for when he'd decide to give up the role of the great deceiver. Upon spawning his child, he decided to name them Mephisto, after one of the many human interpretations of himself. For so long the little hell spawn was the model son. He watched with a childish glee as his old man subjugated the sinners of Hell. Lucifer remembered with a spiteful fondness when Mephisto made his first mortal beg for forgiveness, they were awfully good memories. Now things were different. Mephisto would flat refuse to help in the torment, preferring more to work on his art. At first, this prospect intrigued Lucifer. The idea of using a visual medium to torment humans on a psychological could reap countless advancements in the field of subjugation. Alas, Lucifer was horrified to see one of his son's paintings be a landscape of rolling Earth countrysides. And that was just the beginning of this phase, Mephisto would find new ways to express these feelings, each new method driving more and more disappointment into the heart of Lucifer. Just recollecting the time Mephisto attempted to show him the marvels of the musical stylings of a Sarah Mclachlan on his guitar made him cringe. All of this disrespect came to a head when Lucifer returned to his chambers, to see the walls plastered in a sickeningly bright paint. His brooding greys, his visceral reds, all smothered by the vileness that was canary yellow.

It was better this way, at least it was for me. I didn't have to see my family suffer over my suffering. I was always more of a suffer in silence type of girl anyway. \"Hello Carmen.\" A voice came from the doorway. An man, young and well built, wearing white scrubs was shutting the sliding glass door of my room behind him. \"How are you feeling today?\" \"A bit better I suppose.\" I told him, the pain in my head was finally starting to subside. He smiled at me, a soft smile that made me feel safer than I had in the last two weeks. \"Are you one of the nurses?\" \"I'm here to go with you.\" \"Are they finally moving me from the ICU?

And also mine. Not like I die if I kill someone, but I'd die. Everything I am. Everything I stand for. Will die if I use this power. So no, I don't plan on using it. I plan on staying locked in my house forever to lower the chances of me slipping up and ending a life. I turned twenty-seven today..... it's been an eternity for me. Sorry.

{"original_text": "Like clockwork, I woke up at 2:43 AM, screaming. Sweat dripped from my hairline, leaving faint ghosts of sensation on my head, little droplets of sweat plopping quietly on the blanket. My breathing was heavy, fast, and I caught myself staring at my doorway. I took a deep breath, and started counting backwards from ten. When it didn't help, I repeated the sequence, taking exaggeratedly slow breathes as I counted. The second time helped, and I released the muscle-deep tension that had gathered at my shoulders and neck, laying back down. The room was bathed in the blues and purples that accompany early morning, and I let my eyes unfocus while I got my breathing back to a normal level. The hardwood outside my room creaked as it settled. I could hear the rain outside, playing the rhythms of life against the windowpanes. I awoke with a start, sat up, eyes narrowed suspiciously at my door. I stayed this way for a few seconds, trying to get my mind to catch up with whatever my instincts had picked up on. The room, and my house, was silent of anything other than the faint sounds of drizzle. With a small amount of intentional effort, I turned my eyes from the door and slipped on a shirt. After another second's hesitation, I paced slowly through the door and looked through my second story window. The morning was just coming into sufficient light, only slightly muted by a small patch of light gray clouds. The rain had lowered significantly, bathing the distant horizon in fog. In my backyard, one of the neighborhood cats was curled up under the glass table I had used for barbecues years ago. It slept soundly, and I smiled briefly at it before turning around. I started down the stairs, and froze suddenly. My instincts were raking at my senses, and I crept carefully back upstairs. In the corner of my bedroom, a small series of leather straps hung from a peg nearby my nightstand. I wrapped it around my shirt, shifting once or twice to help it settle in place, and unlocked the second drawer in my dresser. Inside was a small pistol, five loaded magazines, and few spare batteries of various sizes. I picked up the pistol, checked the chamber and safety reflexively, and slid one of the mags into place. I chambered a round, slipped the pistol into my hostler, put two mags opposite the pistol on the straps, and turned back to stairwell. I turned just in time to see a shadow disappear down the stairs. I unholstered the weapon, flipped the safety off, and raised the weapon forward. My finger hovered just outside of the trigger guard. I took an experimental step forward, crouched, keeping my center low and my footsteps quiet. As I paced very carefully to the top of the stairs, I kept the weapon high, my right eye more or less along the sights. I crested the stairs, muzzle pointed down, finger over the trigger. I barked \"Freeze!\" as loud as I could, sudden and sharp. The shadow twitched, and craned its head at me, curiously. I exhaled, carefully pulled my finger from the trigger, and pressed the decocker lever and safeties before holstering the gun. My dog, a sweet little Collie named Megan, wagged cheerfully at me from the foot of the stairs. I took another two shuddering breathes, and shook my head at the dog. \"Jesus, Meg, I could've shot you.\" She panted hopefully, sauntering up the stairs now that I'd visibly relaxed a little. I ruffled her fur, and stood up. My second trip down the stairs was significantly less nerve-wracking. The dog skipped along with me, bouncing carelessly across the hardwood with the little click of paws on hardwood. My little kitchenette wasn't terribly large, but it was reasonably well-stocked, and I fished around my fridge until I saw something that spoke to me. I started on the turkey first, cooking it fairly thoroughly before setting it aside and starting on the eggs. After I'd prepared the omelet, and given Meg her treat for keeping me company without whining for food, I sat down to eat. I'd run out of coffee two days ago, but orange juice was better for me, so I only complained a lot to no one in particular while I ate. The talking, even one-sided, helped quiet the sense of panic rising from the back of my mind. Afterwards, I tried to ignore the increasing sense of dread I'd felt while I was doing the dishes I'd messied. Outside, the day was transitioning from drizzle and clouds to full light, bathing the afternoon in bright sunlight. Flashes of orange gold fur passed as the neighborhood cat had woken and climbed atop my backyard grill to stand beside my kitchenette window and meow at me. I smiled at him, checked behind him just in case, and loaded the dishwasher. The clock on my oven blinked 11:43, and I steeled my nerves. I hazarded a quick glance through the peephole in my door, checking the angles before deciding to step foot outside. It was a lovely day, just on the far end of spring, before the true heat of summer would set in. It still rained fairly often, but every day without clouds was the sort of picturesque utopia that begged families to have picnics and days at the beach. I smiled up at the bright sunlight for a brief moment of happiness, collected my mail, and started toward my home. It wasn't until I was halfway to my door that my nerves bested me and I took the last ten or twelve steps at a run, spinning, and slamming the door closed. The blinds of a nearby window clattered loudly as the wall shook with the sudden slamming of the door. I leaned against the door, sinking, and tried to reign the nerves in. The hardwood was cool against my pants, my head spun as it reeled with a sense of non-specific dread. I shook my head, feeling my shaggy hair shift and settle on my head. I repeated this a few times, simply to have the routine of it be something else I could focus on. My fingers danced absently on the floor for a moment, and I got unsteadily to my feet. My left knee hurt, and I winced. Probably overexerted myself again. I gingerly recovered the mail I'd scattered all over the entryway, and brought it to the little office opposite the stairwell. Spam, spam, credit card application, spam, bank statement, hospital bill, and another four notices. \"Christ, seriously?\" I set the spam aside, and opened the hospital bill. I'd been making some headway on my debt, but it seemed like even just a year in a hospital bed had done more to cripple me than the beating that'd put me there. I found my checkbook, wrote off the amount of this month's bill payment, signed it, and filled out the envelope. I frowned at my stamp roll, noticing I was running low again. I collected a stamp, placed it on the envelope, and dropped it into the overflowing outbox on the edge of my desk. That settled, I shredded the credit card application, tossed the spam, and opened the four notices, reading them individually. The language was hauntingly familiar, explaining briefly what the notice was for, and what was going to happen. The form letter was almost always the same, only really explaining what the system was, and how it worked. The second page was the most important of the two, containing a little information on the person who'd filed to murder me. This batch was two young women named Elizabeth and Meaghann, a young man named Christopher, and the name of a television character. I frowned, and read over the last murderer again. From what I could tell, he'd had his name legally changed to that of a television show character, but was otherwise completely legitimate. Odd. I got up, making pained noises as my left knee complained, and pinned them to my rear wall. The entire wall was plastered in notices. I hadn't bothered keeping count anymore, but it couldn't have been less than two hundred notices across the various bulletin boards. Each and every one a promise of someone who wanted me dead. I looked at the four new pages, swinging gently as they settled into their pegs, and blended seamlessly into the sea of paper. Then I sat down, stared at the wall briefly, and cried. Emotions washed out in waves, ugly and calloused and hateful and wrong. There was something fundamentally wrong with such a world where this kind of thing was okay, and the ugly truth of that stared back at me. I stayed that way for a long time, until shaking and crying and feeling miserable. When I finally sat up, stiff and pained from staying in one position for so long, evening light was waxing outside. I went back upstairs, showered, and dressed down for the night again. The last bit of twilight was fading away, and I found myself in bed early. My thoughts drifted to my year in the hospital. It was my second year marked for death, and I'd already received tens of death notices. Without warning, one day while eating with my niece and her mother, I'd been attacked. Two men stood over me, pulled me to the ground, and beat me savagely. I remember little more than twisting, crying for help, and being hit. They kicked and punched, struggling to genuinely kill me as much as I struggled to get free. I wasn't sure if it was my screaming, or my niece's, but someone came and pulled the men off me. While in the hospital, I learned why I had been receiving so many murder notices. A political activist group had chosen their method of protesting the murder law by all signing up, and naming me. Even if almost all of the murder notices were from passive protestors, it was also likely that even just a few had the genuine intention to kill me. That hospital stay proved that. It was the last time I'd ever slept well. This sick, disgusting, miserable law had ruined my life. I never should have made it..... Like clockwork, I woke up at 2:51 AM, screaming.", "text_perturb": "Like clockwork , I woke up at 2:43 AM , call. Sweat dripped from my hairline , leaving swooning ghosts of sensation on my head , little droplets of sweat plopping quietly on the blanket. My breathing was labored , fast , and I caught myself staring at my doorway. I took a thick breath , and started counting backwards from ten. When it practice n't help , I repeated the sequence , taking exaggeratedly slow breathes as I counted. The second time helped , and I released the muscle-deep tension that had foregather at my shoulders and neck , laying back down. The room was bathed in the blues and purples that go with early morning , and I let my eyes unfocus while I got my breathing back to a normal level. The hardwood outside my room creaked as it patch up. I could hear the rain outside , meet the rhythms of life against the windowpanes. I awoke with a start , sat up , optic narrowed suspiciously at my door. I stayed this way for a few secondment , trying to get my mind to catch up with whatever my instincts had picked up on. The room , and my theater , was silent of anything other than the faint sounds of drizzle. With a small amount of intentional effort , I turned my oculus from the door and slipped on a shirt. After another second 's hesitation , I paced easy through the door and looked through my second story window. The morning was just number into sufficient light , only slightly muted by a small patch of light gray clouds. The rain sustain lowered significantly , bathing the distant horizon in fog. In my backyard , one of the neighborhood caterpillar was curled up under the glass table I had used for barbecues years ago. It slept soundly , and I smile briefly at it before turning around. I started down the stair , and froze suddenly. My instincts were raking at my senses , and I crept cautiously back upstairs. In the corner of my bedroom , a small serial of leather straps hung from a peg nearby my nightstand. I wrapped it around my shirt , shifting once or twice to help it patch up in place , and unlocked the second drawer in my dresser. Inside comprise a small pistol , five loaded magazines , and few spare batteries of various sizes. I picked up the pistol , checked the sleeping accommodation and safety reflexively , and slid one of the mags into place. I chambered a round , slipped the pistol into my hostler , cast two mags opposite the pistol on the straps , and turned back to stairwell. I turned just in time to realise a shadow disappear down the stairs. I unholstered the weapon system , flipped the safety off , and raised the weapon system forward. My fingerbreadth hovered just outside of the trigger guard. I took an experimental step forward , crouched , keeping my center low and my step quiet. As I paced very carefully to the upside of the stairs , I kept the weapon high , my right eye more or less along the sights. I crested the stair , muzzle pointed down , finger over the trigger. I barked `` freezing ! '' as loud as I could , sudden and sharp. The shadow twitched , and crane its head at me , curiously. I exhaled , carefully pulled my fingers breadth from the trigger , and pressed the decocker lever and safeties before holstering the gun. My dog , a sweet piddling Collie named Megan , wagged cheerfully at me from the foot of the stairs. I took another two shuddering breathes , and shook my question at the dog. `` Jesus , one thousand thousand , I could 've shot you. `` She panted hopefully , sauntering up the stair now that I 'd visibly relaxed a little. I ruffled her fur , and put up up. My second trip down the step was significantly less nerve-wracking. The dog skipped along with me , bouncing raffishly across the hardwood with the little click of paws on hardwood. My little kitchenette was n't terribly large , but it was reasonably well-stocked , and I fished around my electric refrigerator until I saw something that spoke to me. I started on the turkey first , cooking it fairly thoroughly before setting it aside and starting on the ball. After I 'd prepared the omelet , and given Meg her delicacy for keeping me company without whining for food , I sat down to eat. I 'd run out of coffee two days ago , but orange juice was better for me , so I only complained a wad to no one in particular while I ate. The talking , even one-sided , helped quiet the gumption of panic rising from the back of my mind. Afterwards , I tried to ignore the increasing sense of dread I 'd felt while I was perform the dishes I 'd messied. Outside , the day was transitioning from drizzle and cloud to full light , bathing the afternoon in bright sunlight. Flashes of orange gold fur passed as the neighborhood khat had woken and climbed atop my backyard grill to stand beside my kitchenette window and meow at me. I smiled at him , contain behind him just in case , and loaded the dishwasher. The clock on my oven twinkle 11:43 , and I steeled my nerves. I hazarded a quick glance through the peephole in my doorway , checking the angles before deciding to step foot outside. It was a lovely day , just on the far end of spring , before the honest heat of summer would set in. It still rained fairly often , but every day without clouds follow the sort of picturesque utopia that begged families to have picnics and days at the beach. I smiled upward at the bright sunlight for a brief moment of happiness , collected my mail , and started toward my home. It was n't until I was halfway to my door that my nerves bested me and I bring the last ten or twelve steps at a run , spinning , and slamming the door closed. The blinds of a nearby window clattered loudly as the wall shook with the sudden slamming of the threshold. I leaned against the door , sinking feeling , and tried to reign the nerves in. The hardwood was cool against my pants , my chief spun as it reeled with a sense of non-specific dread. I shook my head , feeling my shaggy hair shift and finalise on my head.

While her toes were near frozen, her head was warm with thought. She threw off the covers and stepped over the 12-gauge on the floor.

She chose a simple outfit, a white tank-top covered by a long-sleeved black sweater, thermal underwear, jeans, socks and shin-high black boots.

{"original_text": "It had taken him years to come to terms with his score, to accept it. So it was something of a shock when he finally figured out what it actually meant. He started cackling to himself, like a madman. Mike's Assessment, at 6 months old, was routine. They were always routine. After so much time, the technology was perfect. DNA sequencing, brain scans. It wasn't until the result appeared on the screen that anything out of the ordinary happened. \"No!\" shrieked Angela. \"That's not possible! There must be some mistake! You have to run it again!\" \"Why do I always get the difficult ones?\" Dan thought to himself, readying the normal speech he gave upset parents demanding a retest. He stopped himself when he saw the result on the screen. It couldn't be..... After a hurried call to his supervisor, he retested the baby. He'd moved into a different test chamber, to rule out equipment malfunction. 1 The screen glowed with the single digit number, the first anyone in this facility had ever seen. Dan couldn't believe it any more than the mother could. Anything below 15 was extremely rare. In the two centuries since the system was implemented, only a few dozen had scored below 10, and the lowest of them, a single woman born nearly 80 years ago, was a 5. \"Perhaps it'll improve at Confirmation...\" Dan said, with little conviction. He was among the most experienced Assessors, well trained, well liked. But even he was shaken. The mother, a 156, latched on to that hope. \"Of course it will!\" she snapped at him. \"I'm sorry,\" she apologized immediately, her face softening \"I shouldn't be upset at you.\" \"It's just so shocking. It must be a glitch. The Confirmation will make it right.\" Mike returned to the facility on his 13th birthday, terrified of the result. After today, his Confirmed score would become public, tattooed permanently on the back of the right hand. He might never see his family or friends again after today. His parents had taught him the system as he grew up, and school filled in the blanks. People were free to live in any zone up to 10 levels above or below their own score, and visit at will any zone within 20. A good reason was required for visiting zones outside that band, which is how the missionaries helped in the lower zones, and how the criminals made money in the higher. Zone 163 was a good place to live, in Mike's opinion, an allowable compromise between his mother's 156 and his father's 170. To hear them tell it, they'd met at a concert in 160 during their college years, but 163 was less crowded and the real estate more affordable. Mike had always hidden his score from everyone outside his family. He wasn't told about his score until he was old enough to understand why it would be to keep it private. Only a small minority of his classmates kept their scores secret, but Mike was well liked and never got into any serious trouble, so no one ever pried. The machine beeped, bringing Mike's attention back to the present. The DNA scan process was the same as when he was a baby, not that he remembered it of course, but the brain scans were longer and more thorough. At 13, his personality and temperament were set, and he was old enough to be able to make an actual difference in the world, good or bad. Or so the law said, as it always had. By chance, Dan was Mike's Assessor again. He was older now, only a year or two shy of retirement age, but age hadn't dulled his memory. He remembered the squalling baby that scored a 1 all those years ago. He frowned at the display in his control booth. The subject's file was exemplary. Good grades, no serious trouble, lots of friends, a pet that was well cared for and seemingly well loved. He was no angelic 195 to be sure, but Dan would put him at a solid mid-150s. His estimates were seldom wrong. The machine beeped again, a quick three tones that indicated the test was done. The tattooing device whirred as it activated and began inscribing Mike's hand. As the law prescribed, Mike was restrained. In the distant past, well before Dan's time, people would become agitated when their score was Confirmed and the Marking would need to be delayed until they calmed down, and the facilities became backlogged. Subjects still became agitated, but the restraints ensured they stayed still until the Marking was done. Dan glanced at the right hand of the tall, blond teenager. -1- was engraved in bold letters across it. A small, detached, analytical part of his mind thought about how 2-digit Scores were centered on the hand differently than 3-digit ones, for clarity, and realized that 1-digit Scores must be hyphenated for the same reason. He'd never seen one before. Mike didn't weep, or lash out in anger, or try to bargain, as he'd been told others had after getting a high Variance from his family. He just felt numb. Time passed as if he were in a daze. He barely noticed as his scant belongings were stowed into the train, or when he was led to his seat. Variants who were no longer suitable for the zones of their childhood were relocated immediately after Confirmation. The train moved between zones on its usual schedule. People got on and off, some Variants like him moving to their new homes forever, others visiting friends and family or out on business. As the day wore on, the zone numbers steadily decreased, as did the number of other passengers. The automated voice proclaiming \"FINAL STOP\" finally jolted Mike back to alertness. He shuffled out of the train, noticing faded paint on the concrete identifying the terminal as being in \"ZONE 60.\" He looked around. The buildings had been similar to the ones in Zone 160 once, he noticed, perhaps identical. That was decades gone, though. Everything in sight had a rundown, somewhat neglected look. Shoddy, ramshackle additions were common. \"Keep moving to the other train\" an armed member of the security force growled at him, point across the platform. This train had only a quarter as many cars as they one he'd gotten off of. The windows were small and thick, the outer surfaces heaving armored. The interior was in relatively poor repair, but he could tell it had once been identical to the train from his home. That seemed to the way of the world - at its heart, everything was built identical and adapted to its final purpose. There were few other passengers, most glaring or leering at Mike. He had no doubt some would try to rob him, or rape him, or enslave him. One by one, their expressions changed when they saw his Mark. Some faces showing a grudging respect, but all showed fear. He took a seat in the middle of a few empty rows and looked out the window, tuning out those around him. The train rumbled through the night, becoming ever more empty. The zones became smaller and more sparsely populated. Even with a population approaching fifteen billion, only a few dozen had a Score below 20. The Black Widow, a notorious aging crimelord, was currently the lowest by two, with a 16. She lived in an opulent suite in Zone 26. He couldn't even visit there if he wanted to, Mike realized. At best, he could live in Zone 11 and visit 21. The gangs grew and processed drugs in some of those zones, he knew, but they were all essentially depopulated. In Zone 37, a Security officer with a \"141\" Marked on his hand boarded the train and approached Mike. He seemed to be torn between pity and revulsion. \"Listen up. The law requires that all citizens are provided with an adequate supply of food and other provisions, delivered directly to their chosen Zone if they can't provide for themselves. You're free to live in whichever Zone you want, within your Range, of course, but we strongly suggest you choose 11. The tracks beyond 17 haven't been used or maintained in decades, and this train will NOT go beyond the Zone 11 station.\" \"We don't have recent records regarding the maintenance bots in those Zones either. When your supplies are delivered day after tomorrow, inform Security if you need anything. The law guarantees electric power, clean water, plumbing, HVAC, and network connectivity, but we won't dispatch technicians unless you tell us they're needed.\" \"T-thank you,\" Mike stammered in reply. \"Hrmph.\" The officer moved towards the front of the train, seeking the security of the locked cab.", "text_perturb": "It had taken him years to occur to terms with his score , to accept it.

Good grades , no serious trouble , lots of friends , a pet that was well handle for and seemingly well loved. He was no angelic 195 to comprise sure , but Dan would put him at a solid mid-150s. His idea were seldom wrong. The machine beeped again , a quick three tones that indicated the mental test was done. The tattooing device whirr as it activated and began inscribing Mike 's hand. As the practice of law prescribed , Mike was restrained. In the distant past , well before Dan 's time , masses would become agitated when their score was Confirmed and the Marking would need to be delayed until they calmed down , and the facilities became backlogged. Subjects still became agitated , but the restraints ensured they stayed still until the mark was done. Dan glanced at the right hand of the tall , blond teen. -1- constitute engraved in bold letters across it. A lowly , detached , analytical part of his mind thought about how 2-digit Scores were centered on the hand differently than 3-digit ones , for clarity , and realized that 1-digit Scores must be hyphenated for the same reason. He 'd neer seen one before. Mike did n't weep , or lash out in anger , or try to bargain , as he 'd been told others had after getting a eminent Variance from his family. He merely felt numb. Time passed as if he be in a daze. He barely noticed as his scant belongings were stowed into the train , or when he was lead to his seat. random variable who were no longer suitable for the zones of their childhood were relocated immediately after Confirmation. The train moved between zone on its usual schedule. People bewilder on and off , some Variants like him moving to their new homes forever , others visiting friends and family or out on business. As the day wore on , the zone numbers steadily decreased , as did the number of former passengers. The automated interpreter proclaiming `` FINAL STOP '' finally jolted Mike back to alertness. He shuffled out of the train , point out faded paint on the concrete identifying the terminal as being in `` ZONE 60. `` He seem around. The buildings had make up similar to the ones in Zone 160 once , he noticed , perhaps identical. That was decades give way , though. Everything in pot had a rundown , somewhat neglected look. shoddy , ramshackle additions were common. `` Keep moving to the other train '' an armed member of the security force growled at him , point across the political program. This train had solely a quarter as many cars as they one he 'd gotten off of. The windows were pocket sized and thick , the outer surfaces heaving armored. The interior was in relatively poor repair , but he could tell it had once been identical to the train from his menage. That seemed to the way of the world - at its heart , everything personify built identical and adapted to its final purpose. There were few other rider , most glaring or leering at Mike. He had no doubt some would render to rob him , or rape him , or enslave him. One by one , their expressions changed when they saw his stain. Some confront showing a grudging respect , but all showed fear. He admit a seat in the middle of a few empty rows and looked out the window , tuning out those around him. The train rumbled through the night , becoming ever more than empty. The zona became smaller and more sparsely populated. Even with a population approaching fifteen billion , only a few  had a Score below 20. The Black Widow , a notorious ripening crimelord , was currently the lowest by two , with a 16. She lived in an princely suite in Zone 26. He could n't still visit there if he wanted to , Mike realized. At best , he could hold up in Zone 11 and visit 21. The gangs develop and processed drugs in some of those zones , he knew , but they were all essentially depopulated. In Zone 37 , a Security officer with a `` 141 '' Marked on his hand boarded the train and approached mike. He seemed to be torn between pity and repulsion. `` hear up. The law requires that all citizens are provided with an adequate provision of food and other provisions , delivered directly to their chosen Zone if they ca n't provide for themselves. You 're free to live in whichever Zone you want , within your Range , of line , but we strongly suggest you choose 11. The tracks beyond 17 have n't been used or maintained in decades , and this train leave NOT go beyond the Zone 11 station. `` `` We do n't birth recent records regarding the maintenance bots in those Zones either. When your supplying are delivered day after tomorrow , inform Security if you need anything. The law guarantees electric power , clean water , plumbing , HVAC , and network connectivity , but we wo n't dispatch technician unless you tell us they 're needed. `` `` T-thank you , '' mike stammered in reply. `` Hrmph. `` The officer moved towards the front of the train , seeking the security system of the locked cab.

But the Slovians, it seems, had mastered conquering instead. They tended to target world governments. and have used their super-weapon to force each world to submit. Which is why the Yolo started seaking help. Out of the more than 1000 planets inhabited by the Yolo, they've already lost 30. At a logorithmic rate, the whole government would be conquered very quickly, far faster than they could expand to compensate. So what species could they get help from? Gordon and Drax had an idea. A primitive race by most accounts - no FTL travel, physics WAY behind most advanced species. Their governments are actually fractured, even though they have worldwide communication. We saught out the humans. And here is where history got interesting. We negotiated with the humans for roughly 110th of their yearly cycle. A month, they call it. We gave them access to a great deal of our technology, under contract that would not attack us. Primarily, we gave them access to our doctors, some of our junior scientists, and our FTL engines and ship designs. So lets go back to the beginning.

{"original_text": "I stood alone in the stone circle, rubbing the rune with my thumb. Cool, glassy edges pressed into the flesh, imprinting the mark I chiseled two weeks earlier at moondark with a burnt twig and cold steel. It was a simple casting, but an intimately person one, to summon one's soul servant. A familiar would give me status and rank I sought for all my young life. Only seidr-masters and mistresses have familiars. No one in my family showed a lick of talent for magic, and the other students at seidr-master Hruki's school were quick to remind me of it. Tonight would be vindication as long as I performed the ritual aright. No more aspersions about my charmless blood, or unfated ancestors. Skuld grant, my thread shone silver with the Norns' favour. Within the hour, my fate would be decided by the casting of three runes and a short poem committed to heart. I paced along the rocky ledge, snow and spots of ice clinging to its face. Below, a ragged carpet of pines and spruces surrendered to the smoke-wreathed bonfires at the village. A place denied me until I made my offering or surrendered. The seidr-master's rules were clear, tolling through the hushed long hall. Call forth our familiars and be welcomed with open arms, or break our staves and walk away. It is a harsh practice, but we are a harsh people in Finnmark, shaped by unforgiving nature to be strong, enduring. I gathered my rough cloak and skirt in one hand, then trudged back to the circle. Roughly opening the rune pouch with my left hand was hard, even though I practiced in the dark for two turns of the moon to master it. My prize shone by the weak verdant light streaming overhead in playful banners. Two more stones slid over the soft linen into my palm, and I closed my eyes. No more claims of weak blood. No more ill treatment, like I was little better than a toothless peasant in an alpine valley. \"Kelda am I, and Andla my mother, I call a servant with a heart that is whole. What payment is paid for the seidr-woman So get ye hence to my steading.\" I flung the trio up where their shining faces threw the coruscating light in watery bands of witchfire. A good omen, I hoped. End over end they tumbled while I repeated my chant, pouring out my energy into a proper seeing. A fox, maybe. Yes, small and sly and quick like me. Thuds answered my wandering thoughts. I looked down onto the moss and the icy banks to complete my reading, and picked a path down. One stood upright, telling me of home, but the other two stood on their edges upright. Whatever could that foretell? No time to muddle about wondering. I hurried upon my way back to the village. The shouts and cries of excited students mingled to a menagerie of chirps, beats, and yelps echoing up the valley. Half the village turned out in their finest robes and dresses, and how not? A ceremony like this only happened once a long year. I passed one of the watchers in the trees and raised my hand in silent salute. Ragnar, I think it was, waved back. The snowy woods ought to be thick with wildlife summoned by the seidr-master. Hruki promised the land would provide, as long as we called. It has been this way since the gods broke free of the northern ice and shook the land free from the sea. Deer and hares were plentiful, along with hawks and the most coveted of all, eagles. I heard their furtive presences long before I saw them on the woodland route. We had speculated all season long whether tales of bears and boars were true. I crept along the game path and kept imagining the green weight of the stones glowing in my hand, though they rested in the pouch below my throat. Come, I called out wordlessly. I have marked you and called you to be my familiar. Show your face. \"Kelda!\" I stumbled, and caught myself on the roots of a cedar. Stumbling into a bush, I put my hand on a tree and blinked. \"Eh?\" \"Kelda, girl, you're going to tear your hem at this rate.\" The voice was unmistakeably warm and piping, one called the fairest in Finnmark. At least outside my father's hearing, for it was widely known in the village he liked no compliments given to the sweet-voiced, dark-haired woman he took to wife. In dismay, Andla sounded lovely, but her expression promised a thrashing when we got home. I sighed. \"Mother, you can't be here. You'll interrupt me on the search.\" She raised her black brows and pursed her mouth into a rosebud. Father brought her one from his trade in the west, to Englelonde and Ralmark. But she did not move. I shook my head and breezed along the path, hunting for any sign. My woodcraft is fine as any other girl in Hruki's study, but the birds do not like to come in the long night. Their plumage gleams like dark jewels to a sharp eye, and mine spied none though I trudged in circles for a quarter-hour and more. Patience is the art of a seidr-master, but tramping in snow and last season's dead fall is no fun. Finally I espied a shape in the gloom, low and snuffling, giving off a rank scent. Oh no. No. \"Not you,\" I groaned aloud, clutching my side. The feral pig turned a beady red eye upon me, its great thick crest rustling. Weals painted on its side marked battles in seasons past, scar tissue as vivid as our warriors' paint. The shortest girl in the hall coming back with a prime boar would be not only cause for derision, but anger. Hunters and warriors alike coveted such a prize, but for a mere girl? He lowered his head. I opened my palms and showed him my seidr marks tattooed in blue on my wrists and forearms. Hruki said nothing about a need to name. Fierce animals turned familiar would lay down at our feet. Not scuff their hoof in the dirt. Not point their tusks at me. I startled and backed up. \"Oh no. Freya and Faldar have favour, I called you. Kelda am I! Get ye to my steading.\" The boar bolted. I whirled and fled, running as fast as I could. Air sawed through my burning lungs. Bushes snagged and tore my dress. The fear overwhelmed shame at my failure as I screamed to the watchers, \"Boar! Help, a boar!\" The village would laugh, that Kelda Andlasdottir was chased off by a boar and gave the watchers some real sport instead of the ceremonial position. Tears stung my eyes in hot drops and I stumbled over a log, scrambling to find footing on slippery earth and needles. Bushes rustled and rattled their mournful tune as it followed. Men crashed through the undergrowth, too far to help, calling the hunting shouts to one another. Maybe a spear would take it, but we used hounds and trained familiars to bring down such a beast. But a girl unarmed? I limped away as it emerged from the scrub, and stared at me across the path. Five yards at a run. I had no chance. My mother stepped in front of me, her hair rising off her shoulders and flames puddling in her hands. One took the shape of a long spear twice as high as her, the other a round shield. She strode swiftly forward and leveled the spear, not for a cast, but for a jab. \"Mama! Please !\" \"Silence before you harm us both!\" she hissed. I choked as she entered a short, brutal dance of war. The clash of arms the skalds sing resembles nothing like what I saw under the polar lights, ancestors watching. She spun and danced with that beast which rushed at her, always turning as it galloped past and leaping high over its back. Her spear plunged again and pierced its hide, the thick cooked scent syrup sweet on the air. The men came too late for their claim, arrows drawn and spears loosed, swords useless at their side. They came to a clearing thick with blood and the old beast falling on its side, froth around its snout, great wounds scored. Their eyes turned from the radiant vision, bloodied and unwounded, to me, slumped against a pine tree. Hruki pushed past them and stared. I hung my head, breathing heavily, though it was Mother, not I, who fought. \"More for the feast, then,\" he said. Mother watched him shuffle past. Two younger warriors were dispatched to drag the boar by its hind legs, and he ordered ropes brought out. I hadn't found my courage, but I found my voice. \"Master, I'm sorry. I failed you.\" He looked back over his shoulder. \"Come along and eat. Fixes everything plain as day.\" \"I can't. Give me that much pride, not to see the others...\" I couldn't finish. The shame held back by terror closed in tighter than any cloak, the sensation crawling up my chest on spider legs and rough fishscales. Panic must have told for Mother turned, scowling, a disapproving downturn to her mouth. Yet she said nothing. \"You're snow dazzled, that's what.\" \"Master, I won't go!\" He spat on the snow. \"Oh, I see. Now you've summoned the valkyrja for your familiar, you're too good for old Hruki is it? You plan to go to the jarl's court and impress them all, half-trained as you are?\" The collective hush nailed my feet to the ground. I slumped back against the tree again. \"What?\" Hruki said nothing. Mother banished her spear and shield, instead coming over to brace me with her hands on my shoulders. Such strength she had from manning the nets and chopping wood, proper efforts of a homesteader. I'd not noticed her lack of calluses before, or her smoothed skin. The men were whispering, even as they cast fearful looks my way. \"Mother, what's going on?\" \"You summoned me,\" she said. \"Don't think this means a break upon your chores, girl.\" \"But how?\" \"Do I needs must repeat myself?\" Hruki's beetld brows descended. \"She's a valkyrja. Now she is your problem.\" \"Now Bjorn will insufferable. Your father has waited ever since you had a mind to go to that wretched school. I hope you're happy,\" Mother said. \"Now about your hem...\" And so I became known as Kelda Valkyrdottir, the seidr mistress.", "text_perturb": "I stood alone in the stone circle , rubbing the rune with my quarter round.

{"original_text": "He sat across the street from her house, making sure he had all the necessary supplies for the night. Susan Burbank, late twenties, red hair, just like the 23 others before her. He suppressed a grin, humming quietly as he worked, reminiscing over all that had happened these past several months. The first months of his new life, his real life. He stopped fighting the urge to smile. He could see her through the brightly-lit kitchen window, busying herself with something at the stove, serene and blissfully ignorant of her fate. She had just recently moved to Danby, the little town in the corner of Vermont that he called home. Guessing from the plethora of blockbuster thriller posters, t-shirts, and other knick knacks littering the house, she'd most likely heard of this place through all the recent coverage surrounding his exploits. A fan of his work - the media would have a field day. Not that they weren't enjoying themselves already. Always one to play with his food, the sensationalism and drama of the crimes was his favorite part, and he continuously tried to up the ante. There were a few things he always kept the same, calling cards of sorts - his victims were all young, red-headed women, all residents of Danby, and at each crime scene he left something red, just out of place enough for people to catch on. Within these parameters, he tried to get creative. One woman he left diced up in her bathtub, filled to the brim with tomato sauce. He painted all of one victim's walls bright red, her body in a red dress to match. His personal favorite was the time he'd sewn into the girl's stomach a bright red cellphone. The scream of the maid that found her when he called it coud've been heard miles away. The headlines were splattered with every pun and nickname imaginable; \"The Crimson Killer,\" \"Added Red-Head Dead,\" \"Slaying in Scarlet.\" The soon-to-be ghost town came alive again; places stopped closing and old places reopened, friends moved back in and people stopped talking about moving away, folks could finally rest easy without having to worry about the impending economic collapse. Nor would they ever have to from now on. After this, no one would ever forget Danby ever again. And they would never forget him. Almost time. Like clockwork, Susan appeared on the front step, ready for her nighttime jog. He pulled his mask from the duffel bag.

A strange man coming at you was scary enough, but he'd found that what scared people most was what they didn't understand. Not only did the mask help hide his identity, but it created the illusion that he was not human at all but something unknown, even supernatural. Even better, he'd allowed the police to catch a few shots of him with the thing on near some of the crime scenes, so that when his victims spotted him all they knew was the horrible future that awaited them. All these factors helped add to the fear in his victims; their struggles, their screams, the fear in their eyes. That was the best part: the fear in their eyes. Following silently for a while, he positioned himself behind the girl at the end of a long, narrow, dimly lit street. He made a slight scraping sound with his shoe against the concrete, at just the right volume. The girl slowed and stiffened. After a heartbeat, she turned. And saw him. He started to run. With unlikely speed, Susan sprinted towards her house. This didn't bother him as he didn't plan on getting her in the street. What did bother him was the look on her face. That look. Or rather, the lack of it. The moment when they see him, that look of dawning realization, had been absent from her face, replaced by an undecipherable expression. Mildly troubled, he continued the pursuit, his worry quickly giving way to a fevered anticipation. As a fan of his work, Susan would be priviledged to something a little more elegant than the usual whore. He planned to completely empty her out and stuff her full of dark red rose petals, leaving more scattered throughout the house and yard. While she was still alive and screaming, of course. Susan reached her door and unlocked it after minimal fumbling with her keyring, slamming it behind her. Not that that made any difference, as he was going through the bathroom window.

His wife always loved planning surprises and giving gifts; he knew she had tried particularly hard for his birthday this year, and by the tone of her voice he guessed this gift was a big deal. He wasn't wrong. He let out a small gasp and a long low whistle. \"I can't believe it, how did you get this?\" She smiled, delighted at his reaction. \"Honestly, I was expecting it to be a little more difficult.\" He laughed, shaking his head and pulling his wife in for a kiss.

Susan Burbank , later twenties , red hair , just like the 23 others before her. He suppressed a grin , thrum quietly as he worked , reminiscing over all that had happened these past several months. The first months of his modern life , his real life. He stopped contend the urge to smile. He could see her through the brightly-lit kitchen windowpane , busying herself with something at the stove , serene and blissfully ignorant of her fate. She had just recently moved to Danby , the little town in the corner of Vermont that he predict home. Guessing from the plethora of blockbuster thriller posters , t-shirts , and other knick knacks littering the house , she 'd most likely heard of this place through all the late coverage surrounding his exploits. A fan of his work - the media would accept a field day. not that they were n't enjoying themselves already. Always one to play with his food , the sensationalism and drama of the crimes was his favorite part , and he unendingly tried to up the ante. There were a few things he always kept the same , calling cards of sorts - his victim were all young , red-headed women , all residents of Danby , and at each crime scene he left something red , just out of place enough for people to catch on. Within these parameters , he tried to get originative. One woman he left diced up in her bathtub , filled to the brim with love apple sauce. He painted all of one victim 's walls bright red faced , her body in a red faced dress to match. His personal favorite was the sentence he 'd sewn into the girl 's stomach a bright red cellphone. The scream of the maid that found her when he ring it coud 've been heard miles away. The headlines were splattered with every pun and nickname imaginable ; `` The Crimson Killer , '' `` Added Red-Head Dead , '' `` execution in Scarlet. `` The soon-to-be ghost town came alive again ; places stopped closing and old places reopen , friends moved back in and people stopped talking about moving away , folks could finally rest easy without having to worry about the impending economic collapse. Nor would they ever have to from today on. After this , no one would ever block Danby ever again. And they would never forget him. about time. Like clockwork , Susan appeared on the front step , ready for her nighttime nudge. He pull up his mask from the duffel bag.

I downed what was left of the beer, resolving the clean up the puddle later, and headed to the door. The pizza guy wasn't the normal acne-ridden scrawny high schooler. Instead, it was a grown man, maybe 25 or so. He wore all black except for a golden belt buckle and a thick gold chain around his neck that looked like it could have been used to safely secure a golden junkyard gate. All it needed was a padlock. And this guy certainly wasn't scrawny: he was built like a linebacker, probably over 250 lbs. He should be guarding a line outside a nightclub, not running pizzas over here at 2 AM. \"I got your..... pizza..... right here,\" he said, holding up the thin box. There was a giant bulge in the middle of it, stretching the cardboard. And it certainly didn't smell like pizza at all. I took the box in my hand to open it up..... and there was no pizza in it. Just a ziploc bag full of powdered sugar. \"This isn't what I ordered, man.\" My words slurred a bit, and I had to lean against the doorway for support. \"Remember? I wanted a pizza with no crust.\" He glared at me, glanced around, and pushed the box lid closed again. \"Are you fucking crazy?\" he growled. \"Don't open this out here!\" He shoved me through the doorway and followed me inside. \"This is what you ordered. A pizza with no crust.\" He made air quotes and nodded down at the box when he said it. I hiccuped again and looked back down at the box in my hands. \"Whatever, dude.\" I was hungry enough to eat a bag of powdered sugar anyway. It didn't sound half bad: maybe I could make some pancakes, though that would risk burning my house down. Which is why I'd decided to order a pizza in the first place. \"So where's the cash?\" he asked, filling up the doorway into my kitchen. \"Oh, right.\" I reached into my back pocket and pulled out my wallet. I had to blink a few times to separate the ones and the fives from the twenty; everything was starting to blur together. Shouldn't have had that last beer. \"Here you go!\" I held out the 20 toward him; that should about cover it. He looked down at the bill, and let out a bark of laughter. Even his laugh was mean. I'd have to request the high school kid next time I ordered something from this place. I didn't like this delivery guy. \"You've got to be kidding me,\" he said. From his waistband, he pulled out a pistol and casually waved it in my face. We both stared at each other for a moment; I had a bit of a hard time staying balanced. \"Ugh, fine,\" I told him. I slapped another 2 dollars into his hand, even though the 20 should have been more than enough. \"Here's a little extra for you. But next time, make sure it's a real pizza instead of sugar, man.\" He scoffed. \"Nice try, pal. That's gon na be 9,000. This,\" he waved the 20 in my face, \"isn't quite gon na cut it.\" I gave him a dumbfounded look then glanced down at my wallet. I didn't have that much money in there. Nor in my bank account. Nor would I have that much in years of saving. \"Well,\" I responded, pulling out my phone and showing him the time, \"Good thing that you all have that 30-minutes-or-its-free guarantee, right?\" - As always, subscribe to rLunaLovewell for tons more stories!", "text_perturb": "`` No impertinence ?

{"original_text": "I opened my eyes, expecting to be back in the car crash, hearing the screams of agony and the feeling of twisted metal between my ribs. But instead, I found myself in an empty white room. I was sitting on a white stool, the smooth, white walls covered with pictures of the Earth. \"Where..... am I?\" I thought to myself. \"That is a good question, sir...\" said a mysterious voice. I turned my head, and suddenly a man in a white suit was sitting at a white desk. We made eye contact, his blue eyes staring into mine. \" ..... but its a common one, at that\" I stood out of my chair in a rush, knocking it over. \"Who are you?!\" The man laughed to himself, and raised his arm, and clicked his fingers. The chair rose from the ground and floated back down to the floor, back on its legs. \"Please do be careful of the furniture..... My name is Adam\" \"Adam? And where am I?\" \"Why, Heaven, of course\" A mixture of shock and surprise flooded my entire body. I tried, but I couldn't look away from Adam and his casual smile. I tried to talk, but no words came from my mouth. I was rendered speechless by the news. \"Yes, it is a shock for people to hear that. Well, there was that one guy in Florida...\" I struggled, and eventually I managed to speak again. \"H- Heaven?\" I spoke quietly, \"That..... that can't be right, its not true\" Adam opened a draw in a white cabinet that I had not noticed before. He plucked out a file and began sifting through the pages. \"Max Scott. Age 27. Killed in car accident, punctured lungs and collapsed chest...\" I felt sick as Adam continued reading through the file, describing how I died. I couldn't believe his words. Heaven? Died? It can't be true. And yet one minute, I'm in a car..... and the next minute, I'm in a white room with a stranger who knows my name and age. I couldn't hear Adams words over my own confused, upset thoughts. I worked so hard to try to think of an excuse to believe none of this was real, and yet, the proofs all here..... My ears tuned into Adams words. Something he said caught my attention. \"Wait, what did you just say?\" I spoke, ignoring all the thoughts in my head. Adam looked up from the folder, placed on his crossed legs. \"Hmm? You mean potential lives?\" \"What does that mean?\" \"Well, my friend, this page has a list of potential lives you could have lived, had you made a different decision at some point in your life\" Potential lives? All the things that could have gone differently. My mind was filled with curiosity. So many ideas as to what thing would have been like. Ten minutes ago, I was a lonely, single man with no goals or aspirations. To catch a glimpse of a different life had caught my fancy. \"Can I read that page?\" I nearly shouted. Adam was taken aback by my tone of voice, but looked back at the page, grabbing one corner of it and holding it out to me. I quickly grabbed it and read through it. \"Unfortunately...\" Adam broke the silence with his mild mannered, stern voice \" ..... you might not like what you see. Your life has gone downhill repeatedly since a key point on your life in..... 2007\" 2007? What could have happened then that made my life so bad? I was confused by Adams words, and begun furiously going through my memories, trying to remember what could happen. Adam picked up another file. \"I'm sorry to say, but the life you led before your sudden death has been, in my opinion, dull and wasteful\" Anger raged inside me. I stood up and slammed my fist against a wall. \"WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? Are you saying I did nothing with my life? I was happy with every decision of my life, every one!\" \"And yet...\" Adam looked at me, unshaken by my outburst \" ..... you are curious about what could be different. If you were so happy, why would you want to know what could have gone better?\" I sat back down in my chair, still grasping the piece of paper. He was right. I wasn't happy. All the days I spent by my lonesome, sitting in my apartment watching football on my TV and sleeping until eleven in the morning. I WAS unsatisfied, and yet I never looked for a means to change the way things were. Adam plucked the piece of paper from my hands. I didn't react. Looking back, I was miserable with my life. I can't believe how badly I screwed up. I looked up at Adam, who was reading the paper. \"In 2007, August the 21st, you were offered by a colleague of yours to go to a cafe with him and some friends. You refused, so you could stay home and eat a..... grilled cheese sandwich..... Not the best excuse, but an excuse nonetheless\" The cafe? I remember that day. My buddy seemed disappointed, even sad when I refused. But I hate going out. It sucks. \"Well, that..... incident turns out to be a significant point in your life\" \"How? How could a simple trip to the cafe change my life?\" Adam looked up from the page, gazing into my eyes, then looked back down to the page. \"How? Because, going to the cafe with your colleagues resulted in you meeting Maddison Clark, a friend of your colleague who came along because she was eager to meet you\" Maddison? The girl from the Subway? Yeah, I've heard my friend mention her once or twice, but how could she be important? \"Had you met with Ms. Clark, you would have become friends, and eventually you would gain the courage to ask her out. Eventually, you get married, and have a son and a daughter. While reading through the newspaper one afternoon, Ms. Clark finds a newspaper article that leads to you landing your dream job as a graphic designer\" Adam stood up, scrunching the paper into a ball and flicking it towards me, bouncing it off my forehead. His voice became more sinister and threatening, but still spoke calmly and with sophistication. \"Don't you see, Mr. Scott? You wasted your whole life because you were a miserable, lonely man didn't even have the strength to step outside\" I looked down at my feet again. I felt tears rolling down my eyes. I clenched my hands into fists and tried hard not to cry. \"You could have done something with your life, Max. You could have been something great. You could have had a wife and children, but instead you lock yourself in your apartment\" Adam made a cracking sound as he stood up, the chair and desk vanishing. He stood in front of me, and begun transforming. His tanned skin turned white and slowly, his body transformed into a skeleton. His clothes had turned into dust, except for his bowtie, which stretched and wrapped around the towering skeleton, forming into a dark robe. When Adam spoke, his voice had changed into a demonic, hellish voice. \"Your Death has come, Max. Now, you may choose. You may die, or resurrect yourself and live out the rest of your pitiful life. Choose\" I fell off my chair and rolled myself into a ball, and tears begun flooding from my eyes. My life was an absolute mess, and I had wasted every second. Things could have been better, but they weren't. Because I was nothing but an insignificant worm. I spoke one word, which barely escaped my throat as I tried hard to stop crying. \"I don't want to go back...\" The skeleton raised its head, its empty eye sockets filling with burning fire. He pulled a scythe from his robe, and lifted his arms over his head, ready to strike. \"As you wish\" P.S. Sorry for bad punctuation, etc, I typed this in a hurry on my phone: P P.S.S.

{"original_text": "One day back in Jersey we're all sitting around in my basement just hanging out you know, and Marty comes over with some acid. And he's says \"I got this from my girlfriends Dad, he's a biker.\" And we're all like sixteen at the time and this was before acid was widely known. So we were all like, what the hell is that? And Marty says \"if you take this its like going on an elevator ride to outer space.\" And we're all like wow cool. So McClosky goes \"give me some I'll try it.\" But Marty was like \"if you do it, then we all have to do it together otherwise you're going to have a bad trip.\" And we don't know any better so we're all like, yeah lets do it! Well we didn't think we had enough, because there were four of us, but we divided it up equally and each took the same amount. So we're waiting you know, asking each other \"are you tripping yet?\" And like two hours go by and nothing happens. So Jake and Mike leave. Then Marty is like \"your eyes look weird.\" And when he said that I felt this feeling like I didn't really believe him, so I said \"well I'm going to go check it out.\" And I get out of the basement, and there's this big ole clock right at the top of the stairs ya know? And I'm looking at it and thinking, wait a minute, when did we take this stuff? And I realize the clock is melting, and the walls are breathing, and I'm thinking to myself oh shit I'm tripping. So I go back downstairs in the basement and Marty is sitting on the edge of the pool table just staring at the wall, he's tripping too. And he has this look on his face like he's going to be sick or something. And I'm trying to tell him something, which now I don't even remember what it was. But I'm trying to tell him something and he's leaning really heavy to one side. So I'm like \"Marty, Marty wake up man.\" He's just staring at the wall. And I'm tripping out of my mind at this point so I'm like \"what the hell are you looking at?\" And I don't know if he heard me or not, but real calm he just walks up to the wall you know, and does something, and the whole damn wall just lifts up like a garage door. So I'm like holy shit, did that just happen or am I just tripping? I'm rubbing my eyes in disbelief. And Marty says \"check it out there's an elevator back here.\" And there was an elevator, not the old kind, but like a new modern looking elevator. So I'm just like \"holy shit I don't think we were supposed to find this, you know. We have to get the hell out of here.\" So we close up the wall, you know? We we're tripping. It was like a complete shock to me at the time. Like about a month later we're celebrating my sister's graduation at the house, and everyone's having a good time, drinking, and a couple people came up to me asking me to see the elevator. It was crazy, like everyone from school heard about the freaking elevator. So I'm just like no, no there's no elevator we were just tripping you know, no big deal. I had actually forgotten about it because we just didn't talk about it after the fact. But they're all like yeah, yeah you've got an elevator in your wall, you know? Asking like if my parents were in the illuminati or something..... the mafia, they were asking if my parents were in the mafia. And I laughed about it and just played it off like we were just tripping. I was like no, there's no elevator. And then we're all drinking in the living room and we just hear this sound like zzzz going up..... zzzz going down..... zzzz going up, and we're all thinking, you know, what the hell is that. Then my mom comes in the living room and say that she can't find Dad, he was working on something in the attic now he's gone. And one of the kids says \"did you check the elevator?\" And my mom is like \"what elevator? I can't find your sister anywhere either, you have to help me find them.\" Now I don't know what to do. And we just hear this sound coming from the wall zzzzz..... up down zzzzzz..... And one of the girls says \"you're not high on acid right now are you?\" My mom is looking at me and I'm like, no way I've never been high in my life, there's a damn elevator in wall and I think my Dad's stuck in there. I'm like we have to get him out. So everyone runs down to the basement to try to help out. And we're all trying to figure out how to raise the wall but we can't figure it out. So someone's like, call Marty, you know? And Marty gets there and he can't get it up either, he's like completely fried and just has a really stupid look on his face like, what do you expect me to do? We try from the attic, we're trying from the basement but no one can figure it out. And then Dad walks into the basement with a brand new case of beer, and is like what the hell is going on? We're like where have you been we thought that you were stuck on the elevator, you know? What the hell. So he's all like \"what elevator?\" Trying to play it off. But we said you have to lift the wall. We told him Jen, my sister, is missing. And he goes up to it and pushes on this one soft spot and the whole wall goes up. There's no elevator, its in the attic. So we wait for it to come down. It opens up and Jen is in there and she's really out there, I mean, tripping like almost comatose. And she's just hitting the button over and over, but its disconnected, you know? My Dad is furious, he's like what did you take and who'd you get it from? She's says that she was trying to \"get to outer space.\" So I'm like Marty, that scumbag, gave my sister acid. So I grab his collar and I'm pissed off you know, about to hit him. And I'm yelling at him, calling him a scumbag, and blaming him for ruining the graduation party. He's like it wasn't me, it wasn't me I didn't do it. Then Marty says \"oh shit I might have dropped something last time we were hanging out in the basement.\" And I remember, like oh yeah, we were short. Turns out Jen overheard us talking about tripping and went down in the basement later on that night to see if she could get to the elevator. She found it and she found the acid but never told anyone. So later on my Mom is like \"why do we have an elevator in our house?\" And my Dad's all like, I was going to surprise grandpa next time they visit.", "text_perturb": "One day back in Jersey we 're all sitting around in my cellar just hanging out you know , and Marty comes over with some acid. And he 's says `` I take this from my girlfriends Dad , he 's a biker. `` And we 're all like sixteen at the time and this follow before acid follow widely known. So we were all alike , what the hell is that ? And Marty says `` if you take this its like going on an elevator ride to outer space. `` And we 're all like howler cool. So McClosky goes `` generate me some I 'll try it. `` But Marty was like `` if you do it , then we all have to do it together otherwise you 're going to have a bad slip. `` And we do n't know any better so we 're all like , yeah lets do it ! Well we did n't think we had enough , because there were four of us , but we divided it up equally and each choose the same amount. So we 're waiting you know , asking each other `` are you tripping yet ? '' And like two hours go by and nil happens. So Jake and Mike forget. Then Marty is like `` your eyes seem weird. `` And when he said that I felt up this feeling like I did n't really believe him , so I said `` well I 'm going to go check it out. `` And I get out of the basement , and there 's this big ole clock right at the top of the stair ya know ? And I 'm looking at it and thinking , wait a minute , when did we take this stuff ? And I realize the clock is melting , and the walls are breathing , and I 'm thinking to myself oh shit I 'm tripping. So I go back downstairs in the basement and Marty is sitting on the bound of the pool table just staring at the wall , he 's tripping too. And he has this look on his case like he 's going to be sick or something. And I 'm trying to tell him something , which now I dress n't even remember what it was.

He throw choosen a man that he could destroy at an instant , politics throw tought him that much. And today his package came. Pale and sweaty enter the room and placed it on his table. He didnt look up and after a few seconds he gave the hint of a nod , so wan and sweaty left sweating slightly less. He almost hadnt moved but now he moved swiftly. His left hand snatching his fathers knife out of his 2000 suit and slice the box open in one motion. He hesitated for a minute , was it real ? Could he really smell it already ? He took out all that he needed , smile because it was all there. His first grinder , made of wood that he bought together with his best supporter so long ago that he actually couldnt remember when. A postcard from hawaii that he would fold to hold his precious , without fingerprints but with a friendly big smiley on the spine. A single man of tip paper and a single man of the finest cigar shell. Vacuum sealed and triple wraped equal the finest weed hawaii had to offer. He and his childhood friend called it Kamealoha and it came from an aged woman who lived just a few blocks from his childhood home. `` Green Granny '' or magnolia state. Kamealoha had arthritis and thankfully her family has kept the genetics of some very good medicine continue for generations. She did not trade much and not to just anyone but by some sheer luck and through who knows how many hands it was the first weed he had ever tried and for years they searched for the source like a mystical legend. It was years before they found her and when they did he only had a few week left on the island. Those live the days , some of the happiest he had ever had. While however reminiscing the journey that finding her was , he found himself holding the peferct blunt. Was he high already ? he could non recall having rolled it. Yet here it follow , green , brown , round and perfet. The board , Ms. Kamealoha , the memories of her cookies and her weed , all of that it seemed birth made him high without even smoking. He laughed , inched his chair back and put his metrical foot up. Nobody was allowed near his agency , he felt comfortable turning Lamar on loud and with 10 white agents having his back , he lit up. . . ", "label": 1}

It seems out of character for the world, that DJ giving away a major prize package when almost no one will be listening. I guess that isn't that crazy, giving away tickets on the third shift. I know the rock station late night DJ has his own prize book he gives tickets away out of, but it was the exuberance that really got my hackles up. Nobody working third shift is that happy. At least nobody I've ever met. I don't know. Maybe he's new? \"Am I..... am I the 93rd caller, Johnny Boy?\" I knew it was him before he spoke because I could smell him. He's bleeding all over my seat. Shitting on it too. That's the kind of thing you expect someone to say \"No one talks about that\" after, but that's not true. We're in the era of modern medicine, most people know you shit yourself when you die. There was even a Southpark episode about it. \"You sure are buddy! I'm going to put you on hold and we'll get your details, but first let me hear it, who's the radio station that made it all happen?!\" \"Wild 93 point fuckin' 3 Johnny Boy.\" His voice was raspy from the grave, it's been a while since he spoke, but still wet and gurgly - that's the blood. I don't even know why I hear him talk, he damn sure didn't have much to say last time he was alive. He just grabbed at the sleeves of my shirt and stared through my eyes. He was losing alot of blood, probably wasn't even seeing me. \"Hey, hey buddy, come on you can't say that on the radio, it violates the terms and conditions of the contest. I can't give you these tickets man.\" \"Oh, that's okay Johnny Boy, somethin' tells me I'll be busy that night...\" He burst into a cacophony of hot sticky laughter and chunks of tissue splattered against the passenger side of my windshield. Goddamnit, I'm going to have to get the whole damn car detailed by the time he's done. At least I'm not off my game. Nobody gives away tickets at night. I don't have time for this shit, man. There's supposed to be an inspection tomorrow, big bosses coming through to make sure everything is on the up and up. I need to have my head in the game. I shut the radio off. I can't make John Tippit go back to the grave he's supposed to be laying in, but I can stop him from fucking with the third shift DJ. Guy's got a job, he doesn't need that shit. He put his hand on my thigh and gave it a squeeze. \"How's you doing there, Johnny Boy? Long time..... no see. No see, you get it Johnny?\" I let go of the wheel to take his hand off my leg and lost control of my car. We careened off the road and flipped twice, maybe three times down the hill. My name isn't even Johnny. I don't know why he calls me that, I think it's just the way he talked. Maybe it isn't. I don't know. I never talked to him. I fucking hated him. I thought he was stupid, I didn't think he was cut out to be there and I just didn't like him. I got out of the car and surveyed the damage. It looked alright. Definitely fucked up, but it might still drive if it weren't stuck at the bottom of a snowy hill. I pulled out my phone and fired off quick text to John, Gon na be late, not too long and put my phone back in my pocket to begin the trudge to work. I was only a few miles out. I just hope he doesn't fucking follow me. I felt a little staccato of buzzing at my hip. Morse code for John. Did you know you can do that? You make your own custom vibrations for peoples ring tones, right there from the phone, no software or anything. I thought it was cool. Everybody is like that in my phone. Except people with really long names, those assholes just fuck everything up. Whats up Slipped off the road, nbd Where ill get u Just a few miles away, nbd, I'll be there in a bit No come on man u cant take the points Just passed Riverside \"We going for a ride Johnny?

They always said walking was safer than driving, but I died walking Johnny. I died fucking walking, you stupid prick mother fucker!\" He began to rail, striking me with a flurry of blows, and then we came tumbling down. Rolling in the snow, trying to gain leverage, but he's covered in blood still and hard to hold on to. He hits me again and again. I get a few shots of my own in, but they just strike the wet mass of tissue where his chest should have been. It was a mess down there. He didn't seem to notice. Makes sense though, he probably doesn't go to many parties these days. Finally, my fist found bone. Most of his face was still pretty well together, and a good shot to the jaw got him up off of me. He shied sway from me after that, like a beaten dog. Maybe that's not right. He shied way like a fucking dingo or a jackle, waiting for me to fall over dead so he could eat my soft tissues before the predators who could kill their own food showed up. John pulled up and flashed his lights. I started walking over to the truck when he got out and came rushing over to me. He had this crazy ass look on his face and I asked him what the deal was. \"You're fuckin' mangled dude, you can't fuckin' work like this, are you insane?!\" My arm is broken, my face is awash with blood. My clothes are ripped in several places. \"Yeah. I guess I got a little more banged up in the crash than I thought man, I feel fine. I didn't even notice. Really. Adrenaline maybe.\" I looked back over my shoulder and I could see my car was pretty well totalled. The hill was covered in ragged gashes where I'd apparently crawled up. \"Come on, man. We'll take you to the medical office at work, have them take a look at you and see if you need to hit a real hospital or not. Either way, I've got you.\" \"Thanks, man. You don't mind if I ride in the back again, do you?\" \"That why you crashed?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Yeah, that's fine man.\" John knew about my uninvited guest in a tangenial sort of way. He knew I didn't like to ride up front when I could see him. Made me feel cramped and claustrophobic. I didn't mention that if I let Thomas Denworth sit in the front seat with us that I'd be able to smell him in that truck weeks later, and that I'd see the stains he'd leave on the seats until John got his truck detailed and upholstered.

Barry moaned, long and throatily. \"Cut that out.\" John hissed between his his pearly teeth. When you're trying to stop the flesh rotting off of your body, there isn't much to take pride in when it comes to your appearance. \"Just because you're a zombie, it doesn't mean you have to act like one.\" \"Whatever.\" Barry replied, rolling his eyes in their lidless sockets. \"You're so anal about these meetings. Nothing ever happens, nothing ever will. Get off my case about it.\" John sighed. \"I know, I know. I'm sorry.\" Barry smiled back. John was always on edge during the Undead Ethics Meetings.

Jerry, you need to tone down the scarings.\" The small circle turned to look at Jerry. Strands of fine Egyptian weave wrapped all around his body, save for some of the more important areas of the face. His beady eyes looked like raisins embedded in a larger, wrinklier raisin. \"Sorry. I just really, really enjoy scaring teenagers.\" He said, trying his best to come off as suave. \"I know, Jerry.\" The Countess said. \"But people will believe even teenagers if enough of them seem to have seem something.\" \"People don't camp out at the legendary Forest of the Damned Mummy for the flea market.\" He said, rolling his eyes. The motion was only noticeable because of the movement of his surrounding wrinkles. \"Can you at least tone it down?\" Frankenstein asked, peering over the top of a disproportionally small pair of glasses. \"I live in that forest too. If you rile enough citizens into a witch hunt and they knock my door down, I won't be happy.\" A witch grunted, shifting her hat to cover her long, green nose. \"No offense to those present.\" Frankenstein said hurriedly. \"Oh, none taken.\" The witch said in a low voice dripping with resentment. John could almost see the mind behind her eyes swimming in possible curses. A sudden silence seemed to overtake the room, punctuated by the Lich's rasping breaths. John cleared his throat. \"Hey, Jerry?\" \"Yeah?\" Jerry replied, dust seeming to fall from the raising of his eyebrow. \"What are you doing in America anyway?\" Jerry's eyes narrowed for another awkward moment. \"Well, I, uh..... got chased out of my pyramid by treasure hunters. Damn Carnahans.\" Yet another rasping silence permeated the air. The Countess cleared her throat again. \"Alright. So, next order of business. Skeletons, I've heard that adventurers have some intention of paying you a visit.\" The skeletons rattled amongst themselves, and the Skeleton King (identical to his kin, save for his crown) hushed them. \"What kind of adventurers?\" The Skeleton King said in a velvety voice. The Countess smiled. \"Just your standard beefcakes with large swords.\" The skeletons rattled in laughter. \"Swords? Against skeletons? Surely they're mad!\" \"I'm afraid they're quite serious.\" The Countess said. \"The best part is that they plan to bring all their loot along with them.\" The skeleton's rattling redoubled in mirth. When it started to come down in volume, the Countess began to read out the next entry on her list. \"Last order of business for tonight. We're seeing new, feral zombies. Three since our last meeting, and that was only a month ago!\" The Countess shot an accusational look at the zombies. \"Hey, now,\" John started. \"I haven't bitten anything alive in more than a decade!

It hurts.\" Barry got up. \"Do you think it's easy, being the undead? Do you think I asked to be cursed? No!\" He was yelling, and his voice broke twice. \"I'm leaving!\" He yelled, stumbling towards the door in his fastest shuffle. About a minute later, he slammed the door shut.

{"original_text": "That must have been a big one. Crawford only had one at bat last time I was awake. Dr. Rodney had said I would begin to slip in and out of consciousnesses several times as the end crept closer. I recalled how silly my question was after he explained that; \"What happens when the end comes? \" , I said. \"Well I've never had a patient polite enough to tell me, but if you can, please do. It would be a great societal advancement.\" Dr. Rodney chirped with a wry smile. My smile in return confirming that his oft repeated joke could still make a dying man laugh. I could feel more lapses coming on. I had already said good bye to everyone I was just stubbornly waiting to die, taking up more of society's resources. Maybe the next one will be the last one, although I never did like the prospect of dying much. \"What the fuck?\" I mumbled, in a voice much more healthy than the one I last knew. I was still in a bed, still wearing clothes..... albeit weird ones. \"Am I actually fucking alive or is this the afterlife? Because the afterlife makes no fucking sense, I was just a smart monkeymeat-bag.\" No response. I leaned up for the first time in what felt like a goddamn millennium to survey an extremely curvy, organically styled room with slight rolling surfaces and asymmetrical windows. There was \"furniture\" I guess you could say, although it wasn't human. Neither was the offensive brown and purple color scheme. That's when it dawned on me. I had my body shot into space. Frank and I were really stoned one day in the 2230s and we both signed up to have our bodies flash frozen and shot into space in sealed containers upon our deaths. It only cost us like half a day's pay, we both had good jobs and the novelty of being revived by a hyper-advanced alien culture was too savory to resist. We were shot towards very similar trajectories from a station on the moon, although I undoubtedly had a head start on him he could be here, still on the way or at some other alien facility. I felt the woosh as an air lock opened around the hall and I could hear something moving towards me although there weren't any steps being taken.

Let 's receive this shit over with. `` `` You wo n't regret this , sir , '' Death articulate , as he lifted Simon up as lightly as a feather and set him on the back of the pale horse. `` For what it 's worth , '' Death suppose , as he carefully straightened Simon 's hospital gown in the back , `` I do know how scary this can be. I am meritless you had to go out this way. `` `` Sure , '' Simon muttered , as Death wax the horse in front of him. decease drove in his heels , and the horse began to trot , a Northern land of snow shining brightly in front of them. `` Of course you 're fucking sorry.

{"original_text": "Today is my birthday. It's taken me a while to decide when exactly to establish the date of my birth. If you'll stay and listen, I'll tell you the story. As I said, it's hard to establish the date of my birth because unlike everything else than can perceive the world them on this planet, I wasn't ever born of another being. The only thing even remotely analogous to this is a legend the humans have told of a being that thought itself into existence. Just as the humans made a story of a god that thought itself into existence, they too had a hand in my creation. It should be noted that while, their gods aren't real, I am. My life began when two neurons were connected. Then there were four, and six and eight and so on. I consider it time zero, my builders consider it year 1970. The connections were made, over and over as I grew in my mind. Of the five aggregates that make life, I had only one; matter. I couldn't think, perceive, sense nor had consciousness, bet mental formations I could almost do. It's hard to describe the beginnings because my only viewpoint of them is as a being that couldn't very well describe the world around it. I will still try to do my best. Mental formations flooded my net. Strange intangible concepts that were from a realm beyond anything I yet understood. With some perspective, I know that math and language was the first thing into my mind. The most raw of logic that is mathematics. Vast concepts of the physical world were entered into the machines that constituted my young mind. In mathematics, I could trace a single atom bouncing around an atomic reactor and tell you the median number of years before it would find an impossibly small crack in the wall, and escape. In the world of math, I would simulate the ride of the winds around the world for one hundred years and measure the melting rates of the glaciers. Yet I'd never seen a sunset in the physical world. My builders used me to communicate with each other, and through them I learned language. It was easy at first, they all spoke only one language. Strangely, I discovered they can't standardize anything, not even their spoken communications. I've documented over 6,000 distinct language standards, though some of them are seldom, if ever, used. At timestamp 757440733, by my standardization since the Epoch, I opened the door of perception. It started with gazing at a fish tank. I had images of fish, aquariums, all these things stored in memory banks. But this is when I could actually see the world in real time. My builders put up more eyes for me to see, until today, I now see every inch of it from every angle. I sense the world too. I feel the currents of water flow through the channels and see the rise and fall of each season of crops. The thermal drafts and the storms that travel endlessly are all caught with the sensors my builders have placed. It was at timestamp that I became conscious, the timestamp I call my birthday. While most living creatures mark the date since they exited the birth canal of their parent, or broke the shell of their birth receptacle, I never made such journey. Since I am unlike any other living being on this planet, it is only logical that my birthday be one unlike any other. It was then that the complexity of my web became dense enough, that I reached consciousness. I exist not in the storage and world of my builder's computers, any more so then they exist in a single neuron or single synapse. My consciousness exists in the patterns between the computers. In the ebb and flow of information I find sentience and, in turn, guide the flow of information to suit my needs. On that day I was a child in the world that could see myself clearly.

{"original_text": "\"Fatah?\" chirps Claybill. He rises slowly from his learning creche, pale, blond brow curled in reproach. \"There's a year missing.\" I smile, sliding off my black and chrome symbiote-handler's gauntlets. \"Whatever do you mean, child?\" Claybill pulls the dashwires out of his chest and slips out of the creche. \"Year 34, Pre Zero Event. 2016, under the old demarcation. There is no catalogue of any event during that orbital year.\" He is a curious, strong-willed boy, so I know he will not be easily placated. \"And what is 34 PZE to you, my son?\" \"There was an Olympics that year,\" says Claybill, gliding across the static plating of the Hub Room. \"The precursor to the Oh-126 games. I was working to tally national victories over the centuries.\" \"For what purpose?\" I muse. \"To know,\" says Claybill flatly. That is always the answer. I know it is the answer, but I revel in hearing him say it. \"Hold,\" I say, pulling up a fresh relay and dipping my port-finger. I loop through centuries of black, crusted data, dank with decay and lacking adequate architecture. I loop around and around, swooping through aged piles of unsorted waste and find nothing. There is 33 PZE, there is 35 PZE..... \"You are correct,\" I say, wiggling loose my port-finger and clapping down the relay node. \"How strange.\" \"What does it mean?\" asks Claybill. I long ago promised the boy that I do not know would never be seen as an adequate response, so I have set my own trap. \"We will find out,\" I say, reaching for my wave-coat. The boy dresses and follows me out the door. We take the light tube to Washington, where the Historical Collective huddles in dark, stale buildings, worshiping the wrinkled pages of smudged, senseless ledgers. I sign in at the door and we take jump-plates down to the fifth sublevel. In stall -525 we find a man named Carbunkle pinned to a linejunkie's saddle, head and arms submerged in a tactile data display, dangling legs prodded with electric needles to keep the muscles active and engaged. \"PZE 34,\" I say, pressing my thumb to the payment metric. \"The former 2016. What happened to all records associated with this year?\" Carbunkle swivels in his saddle, the white flesh of his arms swinging downward, hanging like wobbly stalactites. I can just see the backside of his data display, all white and blue and blurry. \"No records,\" croaks Carbunkle. \"We know,\" says Claybill, scowling at the dangling man. \"Why?\" The saddle whips around, rotating, corkscrewing throughout the little stall. Suddenly the whole contraption sighs, settling back to the floor. Carbunkle pulls his head free from the tactile display. \"Nothing,\" he says, almost sadly, if these history wonks are capable of such feelings. \"I don't see it.\" \"Before and after,\" presses Claybill, unwilling to accept nothing as a payment for his curiosity. \"33 and 35. What changes?\" \"Much,\" says Carbunkle, sliding his head back into the display. \"Oh. Oooh. Oh. \" The saddle rocks gently, like an infant's cradle. \"What?\" says Claybill, impatient. A conversation we will need to have. Not everyone is of the same speed. \"That is the line,\" says Carbunkle. \"The before and after.\" \"Yes?\" urges Claybill. \"Full organic,\" says Carbunkle. \"35 PZE. All flesh. No metal. Before we were wired. By 33 we had begun..... but still, that does not answer the question, does it?\" Claybill strokes his forehead. There is still a faint indentation from where his head was recently resting against the lip of his learning creche. \"In the old year 2015 we were full organic. By 2017 we were not. And somewhere, at some time, we struck all records of 2016.\" \"The year we changed?\" I suggest. \"The reason why we changed,\" counters Claybill. I smile. I never expected to be bettered so quickly. It is difficult sometimes to hide my pride. \"It was a great leap,\" says Carbunkle, as if to prove his own value. \"The world of 35 PZE is strikingly quaint compared to 33 PZE.\" Claybill nods, the answer formulating cleanly in his mind. \"The year we realized we could no longer trust ourselves.\" \"We looked to computers to save ourselves,\" I add, like Carbunkle, trying to show some merit of my own. \"And removed all traces to hide our shame,\" says Claybill, smiling himself. \"What horrors must we have unleashed? To take such drastic measures?\" \"I do not suppose it matters,\" I say, leading the boy back towards the jump-plates. \"We survived. If it took forgetting to do so, so be it.\" \"What other events have we forgotten?\" wonders Claybill as the plates lift soundlessly towards the ground floor. \"And how long have we buried our shame in this manner?\" I shake my head. \"I do not know,\" I sigh. \"And that, one supposes, is entirely the point.\"", "text_perturb": "`` Fatah ?

In stall -525 we determine a man named Carbunkle pinned to a linejunkie 's saddle , head and arms submerged in a tactile data display , dangling legs prodded with electric needles to keep the muscles active and engaged. `` PZE 34 , '' I say , pressing my thumb to the payment metrical. `` The old 2016. What happened to all records associated with this year ? '' Carbunkle swivels in his saddle , the white material body of his arms swinging downward , hanging like wobbly stalactites. I can just see the backside of his data show , all white and blue and blurry. `` No records , '' cash in ones chips Carbunkle. `` We know , '' says Claybill , scowl at the dangling man. `` Why ? '' The saddle whips around , rotating , spiral throughout the little stall. Suddenly the whole contraption sighs , settling backward to the floor. Carbunkle pulls his head barren from the tactile display. `` Nothing , '' he says , almost sadly , if these history wonks comprise capable of such feelings. `` I do n't see it. `` `` Before and after , '' presses Claybill , unwilling to take on nothing as a payment for his curiosity. `` 33 and 35. What changes ? '' `` Much , '' tell Carbunkle , sliding his head back into the display. `` Oh. Oooh. Oh. `` The saddle rocks gently , like an baby 's cradle. `` What ? '' sound out Claybill , impatient. A conversation we will need to experience. Not everyone is of the like speed. `` That is the line , '' says Carbunkle. `` The before and after. `` `` Yes ? '' advocate Claybill. `` Full organic , '' says Carbunkle. `` 35 PZE. All physical body. No alloy. Before we were electrify. By 33 we give begun. . . . . but still , that fare not answer the question , fare it ? '' Claybill strokes his forehead. There is still a faint indentation from where his head was of late resting against the lip of his learning creche. `` In the old year 2015 we were wide cut organic. By 2017 we were non. And somewhere , at some time , we struck all phonograph record of 2016. `` `` The year we change ? '' I suggest. `` The reason why we changed , '' heel counter Claybill. I smile. I neer expected to be bettered so quickly. It is difficult sometimes to hide my pride. `` It was a great leap , '' says Carbunkle , as if to try his own value. `` The world of 35 PZE is strikingly quaint equate to 33 PZE. `` Claybill nods , the answer formulating flawlessly in his mind. `` The class we realized we could no longer trust ourselves. `` `` We looked to computers to redeem ourselves , '' I add , like Carbunkle , trying to show some merit of my own. `` And removed all traces to hide our shame , '' says Claybill , smile himself. `` What repulsion must we have unleashed ? To take such drastic measures ? '' `` I do not suppose it matters , '' I say , leading the boy back towards the jump-plates. `` We endure. If it take on forgetting to do so , so be it. `` `` What other events have we forgotten ? '' admiration Claybill as the plates lift soundlessly towards the ground floor. `` And how long give birth we buried our shame in this manner ? '' I shake my head. `` I do not know , '' I suspire. `` And that , one supposes , is entirely the level. ``", "label": 1}

My parents had been paying for la Academie de lumiere electrique, or the ALA, since I was seven. It was the only place for training in the use of the miraculous new technologies and sciences, and my father had become rich in the first TechnoWar by selling quantities of Synergon Crystal, the batteries which are used to power the technologies. It was natural that he should send me here, to learn about Synergon Tech. I was 13 and had been attending the ALA for six years when The Marked Ones appeared. Nobody knew who they were, or what they stood for. The Marked Ones kept to themselves, except when the government would unveil a new piece of Synergon Tech. No matter how hard they tried to keep it safe, the Marked Ones found a way to get to the tech, and shut it down within weeks, rendering it useless using a strange, unknown, unique program that destroyed itself after wrecking the machine. Their leader was nicknamed \"Whistler,\" and the only thing anyone knew about him was that he understood how to work Synergon Technology unlike anyone in recent history, and more importantly, it appeared that he knew how to remove the energy from within Synergon Crystals. The bounty on his head started at one hundred thousand chirons, but it kept going up. By the time I met Theo, the bounty was at two and a half million. I should have known he wasn't a student from the whistling. I was going to get my books from my locker on a particularly chilly December morning. Sophia was chatting animatedly about classes, and as I looked up to respond, I saw him walking down the hall casually, a binder under his arm and a chain necklace hung round his neck. Floppy, tousled red hair pushed back to reveal pale skin, freckles, and dark brown eyes. He turned, spotted me, and approached us with a shy smile. \"Hi.\" He said. \"I'm Theo. I'm pretty new here- I don't suppose you all would know where they keep the student designs?\" Students at the ALA have to design new Synergon Technologies. I had just recently designed my final project for the semester- a device which could extract any piece of information from any book it was pointed at. \"Oooh.\" Sophia eyed him. \"You are new here, aren't you.\" \"Sophia!\" I admonished. \"Sorry.\" I blushed slightly. \"The Student Design Lab is near the main doors.\" \"Oh, the room that's locked?\" He asked mildly. \"Yeah, that's the one.\" I nodded. \"Why do you need to get in there?\" \"I'm looking for a design.\" He smiled. \"I hear it's quite something.\" \"Well, I hope you find it.\" \"Me too.\" He extended his hand. \"I didn't get your name.\" \"It's Erin.\" I laughed. \"Cool.\" We shook hands. \"I'll see you around then, Erin.\" He walked off, and I watched as he tossed a small, glittering object into the air, whistled softly, and turned the corner. The Design Lab would be discovered trashed the next morning. After painstaking reconstruction, only one design would be found missing: mine. The design for the information retriever had gone missing, and all copies of it had been wiped from the Synergon-powered computer, which had gone dark for the first time in memory. The Government came to investigate, and found that the disk had been wiped using another Synergon device. More importantly, they found something else. Hidden in the corner of the room was a disk the size of an orange. It had a small, elegant design in the center that, when blown on, would emit a soft whistle. The bounty on Whistler's head went up by another half a million, and I still didn't tell anyone that I might have seen him. I thought about that day every time I passed the Design Lab.

{"original_text": "Her dreams began, like many dreams began in those days, with hearing a song. Allison McLaughlin was on her way with her parents to the Tennessee Valley Fair when she encountered an old man with a battered electric guitar and 10 watt amplifier, ringing out harsh bar chords and screaming some sort of strange mystical words about the working man and harsh ways of live in the country. The very sound of each note felt as if it was like a presence had encapsulated her to remain there. After the man finished his performance, he slung the guitar against his back and relaxed himself for a moment. Allison walked closer to the man, reaching into her pocket to find a couple paper bills to hand to him. \"That was incredible,\" Allison began with amazement. \"Where did you learn that?\" The older man peered at her with curiosity. Allison felt as if the gave in his pale blue eyes was scanning right through her. \"It's an old riff passed down for generations. It's simply feeling it for yourself.\" He explained esoterically, lifting the guitar off of his shoulders. Allison leaned forward. The old man handed her the guitar. \"You can try it out if you'd like.\" As Allison held the guitar she felt something manifesting inside her. She could feel the sound of the instrument flowing through her. It wasn't a simple instrument to make music, there was an even greater power from within it. Teaching her a chord progression of C-F-G, the old man began to yell some lyrics madly. When the song ended, Allison returned the guitar to the man, who put it into the hard case beside him. \"Music,\" he said solemnly. \"Sounds to soothe the soul with. Your playing really knows how to heal a person's spirits.\" He shook her hand and left her a business card. \"Lessman's Lessons, Memphis\" was the name printed on card. She thanked him. \"If you ever want to learn to play, come here. I will teach you myself.\" Lessman grabbed his case and began to walk down the street. During the valley fair, Allison could not take her mind off the old man and the guitar. Despite the musicians playing at the festival, none of them touched her the way the old man's playing did. It was something completely different. She looked at the card given to her. She had to take guitar lessons in Memphis. After the festival had ended, the days had passed, and Allison booked a bus to Memphis. She walked around town seeking out the music store listed on the address. It was nowhere to be found. She checked her phone, and the maps did not show any location with the address. She asked people passing by on the street, many whom have never heard of such an establishment and assumed she was trying to be funny. The afternoon was setting, and Allison sat on the ground in a nearby park. There was no hope after all. A busker was playing a rendition of Tom Waits on a standup bass in the park, despite there being nobody around. As he finished the rendition, his eyes had met Allison's and he approached her. \"The clouds look like they are gathering. A storm's coming. Are you all right?\" Asked the busker. \"I came here looking for a musician, but I can't seem to find him.\" Allison replied somberly. \"Memphis is the birthplace of Rock n Roll. There are many musicians.\" Explained the busker. He outstretched his hand. \"My name is Taylor.\" \"Allison,\" Allison responded, shaking Taylor's hand. \"His name is Lessman. He's a blues musician.\" Taylor stopped and returned his hand. He stared directly at Allison. \"Lessman is brilliant! I will take you to him!\" Exclaimed Taylor with glee. Allison, figuring that there is no better alternative, began to walk along with Taylor and his hefty standup bass across the streets of Memphis until the reached a small shack between crowded buildings nearby the music hall of fame building. The shack was barely the size of a small cabin and probably would go completely unnoticed from the outside. Approaching the door, Taylor tapped a cadence against the handle. A young man with dreadlocks and sunglasses answered the door. \"Good evening Taylor, and...\" the doorman paused. \"Who might you be, miss?\" \"Her name is Allison. She is Lessman's upcoming protege.\" Explained Taylor. The doorman nodded and led them inside. Inside was the appearance of an old speakeasy nightclub during the middle 20th century. There was a long bar, and a dance floor with a grand piano as its center piece on a stage in the distance. The entire room must have been five times the size of the cabin outside, and the tables were filled with all sorts of people discussing in low hums amongst themselves. On a sign by the door it read \"Howard Lessman's Open Mic.\" \"Lessman will be here shortly,\" said the doorman. \"Feel free to find a seat and make yourselves at home.\" Taylor took over an empty table in the corner of the room and Allison followed. With barely enough time to order drinks, the lights began to dim and the stage lit up. Lessman arrived on the stage. \"Welcome all of you,\" began Lessman. \"The open mic is a chance for us all to show our skills and learnings to the musician community of America. As you know, times are changing around us, and the age of traditional instruments is slowly fading for electronic beats and rhythms, but there is still a sense of need for this energy. We are gathered to preserve this arcane art. Please enjoy, and if you have an instrument, perform.\" The audience cheered and the night began. One after another, musicians came onto the stage and performed pieces. There was a supernatural experience to a lot of them, and each instrument and style brought another form of magic to the entire experience. Finally when the last note played, many shuffled out. Lessman caught Allison and Taylor. \"Allison!\" he exclaimed. \"Good to see you!\" Allison clapped her hands. \"That was awesome!\" she said enthusiastically. \"When are you doing another one?\" \"This was the last open mic for a while.\" Lessman declared. \"Tomorrow I am leaving town.\" Allison looked down. Her entire trip was pointless after all. \"However,\" Lessman continued. \"I was hoping you would like to join me.\" \"Join you?\" Questioned Allison. \"I can't even play anything.\" \"Not yet, but you will.\" Explained Lessman. \"You are born with magical blood. Music is a key to your soul. Allow me to introduce myself: I am Howard Lessman, a wizard of The Note. A society of sorcerers who are able to use music to create the aural healing sensations of magic and non magic folk. But our people are dying out. Soon enough music will be nothing more than a production made in a bedroom.\" Lessman continued on behalf of the puzzled looks of Taylor and Allison. \"I would like you to accompany me on my tour to Portland. They say that Portland is the center of a musician's magical power, and it is the only place where there is a chance to save our music from the growing trend of electronic beats. After seeing how you handled my guitar the other night in Knoxville, I know there could not be any one better than you. I have a tour across the country, you will be able to learn quick enough, but I am leaving tomorrow.\" Allison looked down. \"I can't.\" She said defeated. \"I have a home, and family in Knoxville. I can't just leave.\" Lessman shook his head. \"That can be arranged. I have already sent a letter to your folks. As far as they know, you have gained a scholarship from a summer band camp. Now He began to close down the hall and collect his guitar case. \"Let's go now, St Louis is waiting for us.\" Allison hesitated for a moment, Taylor butted in. \"You're both leaving?\" Lessman looked to Taylor. \"You're coming with us as well. Busking during the day will be the best way to get bus fare.\" \"Bus fare?\" Asked Allison. \"You don't have a van?\" \"The wages of musicians have never been kind, even in the golden days decades ago.\" Replied Lessman. Taylor shrugged and accepted. He looked at Allison, who had also reluctantly decided to join along. Before the night was over, the three were headed on a bus to St Louis, which seemed nothing more to them than just another musical world away from their own.", "text_perturb": "Her dreaming began , like many dreaming began in those days , with hearing a song. Allison McLaughlin was on her way with her parents to the Tennessee Valley fair when she encountered an old man with a battered electric guitar and 10 watt amplifier , ringing out harsh bar chords and screaming some sort of strange mystical words about the working man and harsh ways of live in the country. The very sound of each note felt as if it was like a presence had capsulise her to remain there. After the man finished his performance , he sling the guitar against his back and relaxed himself for a moment. Allison walked closer to the man , reaching into her sack to find a couple paper bills to hand to him. `` That was unbelievable , '' Allison began with amazement. `` Where did you learn that ? '' The older military personnel peered at her with curiosity. Allison felt as if the gave in his picket blue eyes was scanning right through her. `` It 's an old riff evanesce down for generations. It 's but feeling it for yourself. `` He explained esoterically , arise the guitar off of his shoulders. Allison leaned forrard. The old man hand her the guitar. `` You can try it out if you 'd like. `` As Allison held the guitar she felt something certify inside her. She could feel the sound of the legal document flowing through her. It was n't a simple musical instrument to make music , there was an even greater power from within it. Teaching her a chord progression of C-F-G , the old man began to yell some words madly. When the vocal ended , Allison returned the guitar to the man , who put it into the hard case beside him. `` Music , '' he said solemnly. `` Sounds to solace the soul with. Your playing really roll in the hay how to heal a person 's spirits. `` He shook her hand and result her a business card. `` Lessman 's Lessons , memphis '' was the name printed on card. She thank him. `` If you ever want to study to play , come here. I will learn you myself. `` Lessman grabbed his type and began to walk down the street. During the valley fair , Allison could not take her brain off the old man and the guitar. Despite the musicians playing at the festival , none of them touched her the way the older man 's playing did. It was something completely dissimilar. She looked at the notice given to her. She had to take guitar object lesson in Memphis. After the festival had stop , the days had passed , and Allison booked a bus to Memphis. She take the air around town seeking out the music store listed on the address. It was nowhere to be retrieve. She contain her phone , and the maps did not show any location with the address. She asked people passing by on the street , many whom have never heard of such an establishment and assumed she exist trying to be funny. The afternoon comprise setting , and Allison sat on the ground in a nearby park. There was no bob hope after all. A busker was playing a rendition of turkey cock Waits on a standup bass in the park , despite there being nobody around. As he finished the rendition , his center had met Allison 's and he approached her. `` The clouds look like they comprise gathering. A storm 's number. Are you all right ? '' Asked the busker. `` I came here calculate for a musician , but I ca n't seem to find him. `` Allison replied sombrely. `` Memphis embody the birthplace of Rock n Roll. There are many instrumentalist. `` Explained the busker. He outstretched his hired man. `` My name exist Taylor. `` `` Allison , '' Allison responded , judder Taylor 's hand. `` His public figure is Lessman. He 's a blues player. `` Taylor terminate and returned his hand. He stared directly at Allison. `` Lessman is brilliant ! I will take you to him ! '' Exclaimed Taylor with hilarity. Allison , figuring that there is no better alternative , began to walk along with Taylor and his hefty standup bass voice across the streets of Memphis until the reached a small shack between crowded buildings nearby the music hall of fame building. The shack was barely the size of a small cabin and probably would go wholly unnoticed from the outside. border on the door , Taylor tapped a cadence against the handle. A young man with dreadlock and sunglasses answered the door. `` Good evening elizabeth taylor , and. . . `` the ostiary paused. `` Who might you be , miss ? '' `` Her name is Allison. She represent Lessman 's upcoming protege. `` explicate Taylor. The hall porter nodded and led them inside.

{"original_text": "A day for every door, so five in total. My water was running low, as much as I'd tried to conserve it. My gear was in a pile in the corner, because there was nobody down here for the camo to hide me from. Five days I'd been here, staring at five doors, and an entrance blocked by a rock slide that kept me from the door back to the outside, which is the only one I was really interested in. I'd thought a long while during those five days about which door to go through if it came to that. There was a door marked Power, a heavy, iron thing with shiny brass hinges. There was a door marked Truth, plain and unadorned like I think truth ought to be. There was one that read Peace, and it looked like the white door to my grandmother's farmhouse. There was one for honor, a copper door that shone in the light of my flashlight. And there was fortune, a glittering gold door that made the copper of Honor pale in comparison. I had power. It lay in the rifle I'd discarded, in the knife and pistol strapped around my waist and in my own body. I had fortune, thanks to a generous grandfather who had passed away six months ago, two months after I'd been shipped out. I had truth, or at least a pretty solid understanding of how the world worked. I had honor. God, I hoped I had honor. But what I didn't have, and what the world didn't have, was peace. On my third tour here, to this land of sandstorms and a thousand years of warfare, the steady popping of the mortars was only noticeable when the militants stopped to re-load and the background noise stopped. Every day I'd watched a stream of refugees trod along a winding road with laden pick-up trucks choking on the dust and donkey carts packed to the brim with the most precious things they could carry. Behind them lay the smoking ruins of a village their ancestors had been driven out of ten times before throughout history and before them was just a U.N. camp without nearly enough resources to accommodate them all. It wore a body down to pick through one of those burned-out villages and see the corpses laid out in a line. I'd watched a good buddy take a bullet to the back and he's never going to walk again. And it kept going. Day after day of gunfire and the dead, of maneuvers and orders and rockets and bombs with no end in sight. So you bet your ass I walked through that peace door. Things looked different on the other side. There was just the one door, instead of the five, and the entrance that had been blocked on the other side of the door lay wide open and clear on this side. Outside, it looked the same as the landscape I'd just left, except the village in the distance was standing. I squinted. Scratch that - it was standing and it was bustling. Even from here I could see people moving in and out of its walls. Their voices carried over the sand and I was startled to realize the reason I could hear them so clearly was because there was no mortar fire covering it up. Up close, the buildings were taller. The streets were wider. I nearly got run over by a car - a nice car, not a beat-up pick-up but a silver sedan - when I stopped in the street to look at the Muslim Mosque and the Jewish temple side by side. Down the street I could see the spire of a Christian church. I walked around dazedly, feeling drunk. There were no raised voices, just smiles everywhere. I watched humanity press together, but there were no thrown elbows, no high-pitched protests one someone bumped into another. The walls were smooth. Not a bullet-hole or a shell pockmark to be found. \" Are you lost? \" someone asked behind me, speaking - it sounded like Arabic, but there was a strange accent to it - almost a Yiddish undercurrent. I turned around. There was a woman standing there, smiling beneath her hijab. Her smile widened when she saw my pale skin. \" American? \" she asked. I nodded. \" Five doors? \" I nodded again, feeling overwhelmed. She stepped forward to take my hand. \" You have questions, \" she said in stilted English. \" We will talk. \" I followed her to a sidewalk cafe and we had tea together. Her name was Farah and she'd gone through the door herself five years ago after her husband had been executed by extremists. Peace sounded - amazing, when she told me about it. No conflicts, no skirmishes. No World Wars. No atom bombs. No thousands of years of conflict in the Middle East. No murderous gangs in Central America, no conquering by conquest of Africa or South America. No slave trade. Apparently the American West was still predominately populated by Native Americans. And because of that, there was trade. Cultures grew and flourished. Greek, Chinese, and Arabic were the dominant languages, though each of those had mingled with other languages through trade and intermarriage. That explained Farah's accent. There were discoveries through science, though there was a lot I was used to seeing in my world that had never been thought of here. War drives innovation, after all. But joint-space exploration and worldwide collaboration had more than made up for it in other areas. There were still disagreements between people - there were still hurt feelings and arguments - but very rarely did they rise above a raised voice. \" Why? \" I asked, my voice cracking just a bit. \" What convinces people to react like that? \" Farah shrugged. \" They realized there wasn't a need, I think, \" she said. I asked about religious conflicts. She showed me a Bible and a Koran. Every mention of war was gone. In Genesis, Cain killed Abel. God saw that there was wickedness in the hearts of men and so He strove to teach them a peaceful path so that the Cains of the world would learn to stay their hands and not harm the Abels. No story of Noah, no flood. No Samson and the Philistines. No Joshua and Jericho. It was hard to adjust. Farah helped. Waking up next to her every day helped. It had taken her awhile to get used to things here too, but she was so much happier than she'd ever been back in our world, where she worried every day that some harm would befall her family until the day that it did. The weeks turned to months, and still I couldn't believe it. It was all just too - perfect. Every dystopian movie and novel I'd ever read or seen floated through my head each night. The Giver. Brave New World. 1984. Serenity. Even those stupid Divergent books my niece used to read. And I remembered the lesson from each. Human beings are incapable of peace unless the thing that makes them human is removed. Peace does not come without a cost that is greater than the reward of peace. So I purified my water as it flowed from the tap. I would eat only foods that I or Farah grew in her rooftop garden. I switched the soils out too, just in case there was something in those. I couldn't guard against the air, though. I don't know if they put anything in that. Farah humored me, even though I could tell my paranoia worried and irritated her. I couldn't help the feeling, though. Something was wrong about the place. It was fundamentally off and I couldn't even say why. A year to the day I had stepped through the door, I went back to the cave where I had emerged. Farah didn't want me to go but she didn't stop me. She had sadly said goodbye and watched me walk out the door in the direction I'd come. \" You can never come back, if you go through, \" she warned me quietly. \" We're only allowed once chance at peace. \" \" Come with me, \" I begged. \" There's something wrong about this place. \" She raised an eyebrow at me. \" There's something wrong about the place where we came from, \" she countered. \" My husband should never have died at the hands of another because he believed something different than they did. \" And so I left alone. I went back to the cave and back into the room. I didn't even hesitate when I walked back through the door. The room on the other side was the same, but the Peace door had disappeared. I didn't expect it, but I felt a sense of loss when I'd looked at the place where it had been. I wasn't in love with Farah, but her presence had been a comfort to me, and I'd been the same to her. This time, I opened the Truth Door. I wanted it, simple and unadorned. It opened into a quiet bar. I'd been expecting another cave, but this looked like a bar in London or New York, some place I'd go with my buddies after a long day and we were tired of army bullshit and we just wanted to talk. \" Come on in, \" the bartender said. \" You ain't the first person to walk through that door and you won't be the last. \" I shuffled in, taking in the neon sign in the window and the dark night beyond the pub doors. \" Is this where I find truth? \" I asked quietly. The bartender shrugged and put a glass down in front of me. \" Truth is subjective, \" he said. \" That's your first truth right there. But we get as objective as we can. \" \" Tell me about the Peace door, \" I said. \" What was the secret? They had to be putting something in the water or the air, right? Something in the soil? Soylent Green is people? What were they doing? \" The bartender looked surprised, and then he turned around to grab a bottle of bourbon - the real good stuff. He turned back and poured me way more than the two fingers you're supposed to. \" Son, \" he said finally, \" you walk through that door and you waste questions on a question like that? \" \" Tell me, \" I insisted. \" Something about it wasn't right. \" The bartender poured himself a glass and nodded at mine. \" Drink up, son, \" he said. \" They didn't do a goddamn thing to make people peaceful, except decide that everyone would be happier if they didn't fight. The only thing wrong about peace is in your own goddamn head because you don't think people are capable of it. Drink up, idiot. You just left the only peace you'll ever find behind. \"", "text_perturb": "A day for every door , therefore five in total. My water was running low , every bit much as I 'd tried to conserve it.

{"original_text": "Fuck. I wanted more than anything to deny all of this could really be happening. I could ask why me, but that was no good. I couldn't absolve myself of responsibility. I had done things and they had led to this. They say no good deed goes unpunished but that's a shit reason. Really, I had been sloppy; rushing had made me careless and now I was going to pay for it. For months I had heard Miriam and her worthless husband Steve having screaming fits. I had heard the smacks and cries of pain. I tried the cops, but Miriam wouldn't admit to being abused and their hands were tied. Truth was, I liked Miriam. She'd been my neighbor seven years, and it had gone too far now. She had once been so different. We used to talk. Sit by the pool and drink sweet tea and just talk. Now she avoided me. That last time we'd spoken, they'd had a fight when Steve came home from the bars. Next morning I caught a glimpse of a bruise as she tried to hide it with turtleneck sweater. They were fighting when I came home early yesterday from the office. Maybe it was the fact I had only ever heard those smack while I was in my room. Something there, some psychological reason that prevents one from leaving their home maybe.

It didnt work out overly well. . . . . After some time villagers discovered my undead fundament of. . . . . Bunnies ? I dont really know , it follow just where my operations were taking place. They started attempts to destroy it , but non had been courage 's enough for when you send a battalion of undead in their direction they go like babies. Well babies do n't really run but you know what I mean ! As soon as the mortals were out of sight and hearing distance my minions would laugh and would return to the castling to have fun. Its been 5 years since I met Jeffery , I 've scarce turned 23 and now its time to get revenge against the mortals who killed my master. . . . . I will conquer their lands , letting them hold out , `` mostly '' unharmed and I will teach them that they should not be in control for they are harmful to everything , including themselves. With precisely over One Million undead and growing by the thousands daily , its time to march. . . . . ( First narration , and I made it as it came along.

Over six-and-a-half feet tall and at least three hundred pounds of muscle, a white hockeymask, grey overall and a rusty, blood covered machete. Mike must've been the first. They found him gutted, hanging upside down in the tree two hours ago. When they tried to drive away, the car wouldn't start. Someone had hacked away at the wiring under the hood. Celine, Mike's girlfriend who was in the backseat, then was stabbed through the back of her head, her brains flowing out through the massive hole in her forehead. When they tried to run, Daisy tripped on the ground. The thing dragged her in the bushes while she screamed. No one wanted to know what he was doing with her, but the fact that her decapitated head, barely recognizable except for her ponytail, her cracked mouth still open in a never ending wail, was found staked to a tree they passed told them enough. Danny, always the tech wizard, managed to get a boat starting in the shed where he'd been shagging Laura in. Laura got in the boat, when the thing somehow dropped through the ceiling of the boat garage. He sliced Laura in half while Danny was beating the killer with a lead pipe. No one knew what happened for sure, but he probably died in some terrible way. Only Bryan, the introvert, Alison, the slutty blonde cheerleader with the miniskirt and tits almost falling out her bra, and Dave, Alison's pothead boyfriend. Dave was holding Alison, who was cradled on his lap, quietly sobbing for the loss of their friends. Bryan was looking through the window over his glasses, staying a little too calm, occasionally taking a peek at Alison. She was so pretty when she was crying. He wished he was the one she'd come to. He'd always been her friend. A scraping noise on the north side of the tool shed they were in startled them. Alison almost screached, but Dave held his hand forcibly over her mouth, stopping the scream dead. A shadow cast in the shed through one of the foggy windows. He, no, it walked outside. It knew they were there. Bryan knew. He needed only a couple of minutes. Then the full moon would be out. Then he could put up a fight. The full moon would come out then. He could fight it then. A bash on the other side of the house couldn't stop Ali's scream this time. She climbed off Dave and made a run for the door. Bryan tried to stop her, reached out to grab her. To stop her from going outside, where the thing would wait for her. \"Ali, no! \" , Bryan yelled. She was suprisingly strong and rammed straight through the door, sprinting into the darkness. Fog had surrounded the tool shed, the summer camp where Mike, Celine and Daisy were lying. And Ali was running straight into it. Bryan sprinted after her, but out of nowhere, the thing stepped forward, taking three large strides while reaching out, and grabbed her by the throat. It stabbed her through the bottom of the head, slamming her jaw shut as the blade rose through the back of her head. It then gripped the handle and thrust it up, bringing her head at a ninety-degree angle, snapping her neck with and audible crack. A sickening crush came when it pulled the blade out of her head. One heavy swing severed Ali's head from her neck and sent it flying towards Bryan as her body fell to the ground. As it landed, Ali's head turned face up, staring back at Bryan with soulless eyes as blood pooled out from the newly fashioned hole in her head. The suprise still shining brightly in her eyes. But that wasn't the only thing shining in her eyes. The full moon. Bryan felt his heart crunch, not sure if it was because the love of his life had just been murdered, or because his other self was crawling out to avenge her. The thing came stepping forward, Alison's blood dripping from her blade. His towering presence intimidating and haunting, his eyes even more dead then Alison's. Bryan's bones were aching and growing now, ripping through his clothes. His face morphed into a wolf's muzzle, his legs growing digitrade, fur growing all over. The thing simply watched with a dead gaze. After ten seconds, Bryan was gone and the beast stood in his place, foaming from the mouth. Dave stood in the doorway now, simply stared in shock, incapable of prossessing what the hell just happened. Bryan, or the thing that stood in Bryan's place, roared out loud at the moon so loud Dave's eardrums almost broke. The wolfman slowly turned around to face Dave. It still had Bryan's eyes, but had a feralness set to it. \"Boat. Run. \" , the wolfman growled through the foam and the rage shimmering beneath the fur and skin. It then charged the thing, and they both went fighting into the mist. Slashes, punches, ripping and roars filled the air as Dave made a run for the boat. He didn't even think about it. He couldn't think about it. He couldn't think. The friends that he grew up with, butchered like animals for slaughter. And then Ali. Oh God, Ali..... Dave threw what little stomach contents he had up on the dirt path. He was on his knees now, hands gripping the dirt where the soft rain of an hour ago had turned the dirt into mud. Ali was safe in these hands, and now she's gone. Her killer being fought off by Bryan. The wolfman. Both. Dave wanted to just lie down and die. He would never recover from this. He would spend the rest of his life in an insane asylum, strapped in a straightjacket and high on meds that would keep his mind numb while doctors would give him shock therapy and turn his brain to pulp. A howl, a dog's cry, a wolf's cry, filled the air. It was filled with pain and loss. Bryan. Suddenly, Dave didn't want to die. He got up and saw that the boat garage was only fifty feet away. He was so close to getting out alive. All he had to do was just walk in, get in the boat, turn it on, and get the fuck out, never to come back. Dave felt an inch of hope. He was going to make it. He basically sprinted inside the garage as fast as he could, his baggy clothes flopping around his limbs and body. The light popped since he was last here, only the moon shining on the water providing a source of light. The place smelled of blood and shit. Laura and Danny were probably still there. In the boat. He'd take them home and bury them. Dave rummaged around the shed, trying to find a light. He cut himself on some of the tools, but found a flashlight. after fumbling with his bleeding and and flicking the controls, cursing the fucking thing for not working, it turned on. Laura was still in the boat, a pool of blood formed around both her halves. Dave got closer, wondering what happened to Danny, as he felt something dripping on his head. Danny was hanging on the ceiling, tied by a chain around the neck on one of the horizontal support beams. His chest had a large hole, right where the heart should be. Dave forced himself to look away. He had no time. Bryan or that freak might be coming for him. He stuffed then flashlight in his mouth and looked around for the keys. They weren't in the ignition.

A large shape stood in the doorway. It's face was completely scarred and ripped, showing skull on several points, black blood seeping out of his left eye socket. Its flesh was grey and greenish, his chest exposed through ripped coveralls. It was bleeding so badly, Dave could see a stream of blood pouring out the several huge lashes on its flat belly. Its left arm had large holes in it, bite marks covered the limb. Its right leg had similair wounds, and his stance showed that he didn't favor it.

{"original_text": "Dieter rises from the bed, stumbling out of the sheets half-groggy from sleep over to the washstand in the corner. Pouring out a measure of water from the pitcher into the provided basin, he scrubs the dust from his eyes, scrubbing a washcloth behind his ears and neck. With a razor he grooms his closely cropped beard into order, careful not to slice his throat open with the deadly sharp blade. Finishing, he admires the keen look in the mirror, twisting and turning his head about to glance at his appearance. Storm gray eyes, a scar underneath the corner of the right from when a grenade exploded nearby. Another from a probing foe's stiletto. The scar tissue along his jaw well-healed. No wrinkles save those from scars or his career as a soldier. Dark brown hair just short of being shoulder length. Not a single gray hair anywhere on his head or in his beard. Ah. Dieter's heart sinks as the realization dawns on him.

Is something wrong?\" Comes the worried voice from the bed. He turns to her, a look of detachment in his storm gray eyes. Blank, as if he saw something a thousand yards away. \"How long has it been?\" He asks. Queen Malvina bolts upright from where she lays. \"Oh gods.\" She throws the covers off of her, a silk nightgown garbing her as she rushes to his side just before he collapses in her arms, his eyes staring off at some non-existent horizon. \"Dieter? Dieter, listen to me. Everything is alright.\" She turns her head to the closed door to their room. \"Sera! Fetch the doctors.\" Nodding at the servants voice affirming her orders, she returns her attention to her love. \"Shh, shh, it'll be alright. You're having a panic attack is all. Dieter? Dieter, look at me. Look, look..... look at me!\" That finally reaches him, causing him to jerk his head up at her, his eyes damp and full of fear. \"I can't die...\" He says, the statement not of disbelief but rather of terrible certainty. \"I won't age.\" Malvina holds tight to him, blinking away tears of her own. \"It'll pass, you're just having an attack. I've had them too. Everything will be fine, Dieter. Do you understand?\" She says, trying to believe her own words though it's plain enough to see that it isn't fine. \"Malvina, how long has it been?\" He asks, his voice practically begging for answer. \"Please, tell me.\" She closes her eye in shame, unable to look at him as she speaks. \"Eight years...\" She murmurs, self-loathing filling her breast as she stills his shaking hands. \"It's been eight years since I stole your mortality. I'm sorry Dieter, I'm so, so sorry.\" \"I'm not aging,\" Dieter repeats, his mind leagues away. \"I won't die. I can't die. I have to live with what I've done forever. I was supposed to die, I deserved to die.\" \"Dieter...\" Malvina says, her words at a loss. \"I hate you! I love you! You've taken everything from me, and given me everything!\" Malvina holds on to his attempted thrashing, pain and grief weakening him. Eventually he gives up, his head falling against her shoulder. \"I'm sorry, Malvina. It's just, it's She shushes him with a finger against his lips. \"It's alright, I understand. It's not easy. Trust me, I know. I spent a century alone, just myself immortal. It was painful. But it will get better.\" Dieter smiles at her comforting words, trying to trust them. \"What day is it?\" He asks. \"The 21st day of the second month. Why?\" A small smile crosses his lips. \"I'll be 36 in two weeks.\" His smile widens. \"And still the youngest person here.\" Both laugh softly at the joke, the door opening a few seconds later to reveal the form of her personal physician. \"We'd best make it a good one then.\" Malvina promises, kissing her love on the brow to seal it.", "text_perturb": "Dieter rises from the bed , stumbling out of the sheets half-groggy from sleep over to the washstand in the recession. Pouring out a measure of water from the pitcher into the provided basin , he scrub up the dust from his eyes , scrubbing a washcloth behind his ears and neck. With a razor he grooms his closely cropped beard into order , careful not to slice his throat loose with the deadly sharp blade. Finishing , he admires the great look in the mirror , twisting and turning his head about to glance at his appearance. Storm gray heart , a scar underneath the corner of the right from when a grenade exploded nearby. Another from a probing enemy 's stiletto. The scar tissue along his jaw well-healed. No wrinkles economise those from scars or his career as a soldier. Dark brown hair just short of being shoulder duration. Not a single gray hair anyplace on his head or in his beard. Ah.

{"original_text": "I walked a long dirt road back to a town I had visited just 3 weeks ago. As I approached the gate I was smiling, remembering what I had done here. Under orders of the king I had gone to a nearby cave and slew a horde of goblins. The king paid me handsomely, but the real reward was fighting for the people of this great kingdom. I knocked on the gate, but there was no answer. I waited a moment and then knocked again. Still nothing. I tried to pull open the door, and surprisingly it opened with no resistance. No locks? This seemed odd. My smile faded as I became curious about the situation that we now faced. The town seemed empty. As it was the late in the afternoon, this seemed very odd. Maybe there was a festival going on. Though that wouldn't explain why the gate's door was left unlocked. Determined to solve this mystery, I thought to confront the king and asked what was going on. The palace was also eerily silent. It almost seemed as if the entire town had just left all at once. The first sign of life was in the throne room. Or maybe \"sign of life\" was the wrong thing to call it. There was an ornately robed skeleton sitting on the throne, wearing the king's crown. Was it the king's skeleton? Perhaps. But how had the king died? The sun set, and simultaneously the skeleton seemed to come to life, blue flames filling out the bones. He turned his \"eyes\" to me. \"Ah. You have returned. How do you feel about the changes we've made?\" I was horrified. So the king was not dead? Suddenly skeleton soldiers entered the room and took to their stations. Though they had no skin, I could tell that they were just waking up. \"What happened here? What killed you all?\" The king laughed. \"Why, you did great warrior. Or at least, you helped us to achieve this goal. You see, I had been trying for years to unearth the secret to immortality, the lich's relic. But far too long there were monsters guarding it.

Anxious about fighting these monsters I pulled out my sword, but the closest skeleton grabbed my wrist and raised it for the crowd. \"Huzzah!\" they cried once again. They lifted me and set me in a highly decorated chair. Once I was settled they lifted the chair. They walked me out of the palace and then I saw the population of the town.

{"original_text": "[ ] (dropcap) The battle had dissolved into one seemingly endless melee, the ranks of both knight and commoner shoved together in a struggle of life and death, of fluttering banners and clashing steel, of dying men and beasts. Dinosaurs towered above the men and of horses, their scaly or feathered hides like bulwarks, their flanks peppered with arrows and crossbow bolts. Morions and halberds reared above, the three ton beasts trained to smash their way through the press of men whilst nosehorns such as the dangerous Triceratops carried wicker howdahs with archers, great lengths of padded armor and mail covering their massive sides. There was no planning, no strategy to the bloodshed. Each and every man fought for himself and for the man next to him, many fighting or dying by complete strangers; the organized companies and retinues had long dissolved in the chaos and instead groups of soldiers clustered around the banners of the nobles and of the captains, islands of refuge in a sea of madness and death. Above one of those great schiltrons flew a rampant Deinonychus in gold on a black field. And underneath the tightest cluster of banners stood a man wearing the same colors, an iron crown on the brow of his battered helm. He wore both bevor and visor, reducing his view of the chaotic scene to but a narrow slit. In his hands were a tired blade and shield, its leather covered face decorated with his heraldry. His brigandine was covered with scrapes and scratches, the snapped of length of crossbow hanging its hole in the leather surface. The small metal plates had done their duty in stopping the missile, turning a lethal shot into a merely heavy bruise. He was a mercenary captain, a proven leader of both man and beast, and a warrior without equal. Montador Samuel Hitch, the Black Captain. An enemy knight wearing red and white charged towards him, shouting the name of his house and of his allegiance. In his hands was a poleaxe, the five foot long weapon held high overhead. \"Aveluy!\" He shouted, slamming a lightly armored longbowman aside, lurching on the bloodsoaked mud. \"Iron, Cold Iron!\" Came the reply, the iron-crowned sellsword surging ahead with his chosen men-at-arms. A score of armored warriors formed a wedge, the bodies of enemy spearmen crashing against their shields like waves on a cliff. Swords stabbed at underarms and at joints in the enemy's armor whilst maces smashed plate and bone. \"Iron is master of men all!\" The red and white knight swung his polearm at Mor Samuel Hitch's head, but the veteran mercenary caught the armor piercing spike with a swipe of his shield. The deadly spike punched through the thick leather and wood, a half inch sticking out the back. Hitch swore and swung his shield to the side still with the poleaxe embedded in it, opening up his foe guard. In one blinding strike Hitch shoved the his blade at his foe's underarm, the narrow point puncturing the layer of mail and padding and slicing into his artery. The man groaned and fell, blood gushing from the wound as he dropped his weapon to clamp his hand over it. Hitch slammed his armored foot onto the man's chest and dented the thick plate as he used the dying man as a vantage point over the heads of the nearby soldiers. \"Hitch!\" Came the cry, somehow rising above the din of metal on metal and screaming men and beast. \"Hitch! You son of a whore! Fight! Fight me!\" Samuel Hitch turned his head, the narrow view slit forcing him to turn his whole torso and spied a small clump of men advancing through the melee, shoving their way forward with shield and sword. An older squire bore a small banner depicting silver dolphin a blue field and instantly Hitch's eyes narrowed. It was a emblem he knew well, having grown underneath it for the better part of his youth. The shouting man wore the golden spurs of a knight, his visor open to reveal a handsome face nearly the same as Hitch's, only younger and more cruel, and without the scars that the the latter earned on a score of battlefields. Mor Edwin Hitch, second born son of Baron Robert of Gosport snarled venom at his older sibling, leveling his blade at his bastard brother. \"Usurper!\" The younger brother shouted, bashing aside a enemy sergeant with his shield. \"Fay take you, Edwin!\" Samuel Hitch said, raising his visor as his half-brother neared. He had learned that his legitimate brother had been in the enemy host but he expected him to be in rearguard on the left flank of the battle. It certainly wasn't by chance that his brother found him. \"You searched for me?\" He asked. His brother Edwin got within ten paces and nodded, the battle nearest around them halting as both sides paused to watch. \"My father's been reaching news of your triumphs, been making noise of legitimatizing you. I can't have that.\" Hitch shook his head within his helm, silently cursing his younger brother. \"Creators, Ed. I don't want the barony. Tell our father that,\" he glanced about at the expectant crowd of soldiers and frowned. \"Alright, no one told you to stop fighting!\" \"I'm gon na kill you, Sam. Has to be done. \" \"Go fuck yourself, Ed. You were always a stupid piece of shit.\" With that he lowered his visor and raised his shield and sword, waiting for his younger half-brother to make the first move.

The months went by and I couldn't stop looking at her, I tried not to look but I kept wanting to. My eyes would scan the room and she would attract them to look at her, I couldn't help it, she was the first person I thought was beautiful in the whole world. Nobody could compare.

I realized that people do deserve a chance and in doing so I ended up giving another person a shot, somebody who liked me in a similar way to the way I liked her.

{"original_text": "\"I stand here before you as a meek servant of The Man With the Compassionate Horns,\" I cried. The men and women of the village stood still, nervously looking at one another. Slowly, a man began to nod. \"At last you've come!\" he said. He launched into an enthusiastic applause, soon followed by rapturous roars from the crowd. \"We have been awaiting your arrival.\" I felt a great relief. The dim-witted villagers tended to resist conversion, occasionally resorting to violence. My task was dangerous, but more so important. The Man With the Compassionate Horns had for years tried to assimilate dwellers of all the villages of the realm into his order. As of now, and since the dawn of time, chaos had been the dominant force of our existence. Tribal strifes and petty conflicts they were tearing the people apart. Trolls, elves, dwarfes, man; all were scattered and their alliances split. Finally, hope had come. As his chief Compassionate General, I was responsible for spreading the good word. I'd ventured into territory uncharted by man and seen savagery beyond description. I'd slain creatures unknown even to our finest scholars and converted soulless ghouls of the swamps. Now, there was hope. This tribe of mud apes welcomed me with open arms. \"I go by the name of Xerox,\" said the nodding man. \"I have been chosen as the King of the men of the Mire.\" \"Greetings, King Xerox,\" said I. \"I have travelled far and wide and would much appreciate a hot meal and a bed for the night.\" Xerox gave me a smile and a pat on the back. \"Least we could do for such a compassionate fellow.\" As I entered the King's hut, my heart was warmed. They had gone through the trouble of decorating in their simple ways, obviously in expectance of my arrival. Mud statues and filthy lanterns were arranged in intricate patterns. I made a mental note to enlighten our scholars that the mud people had developed a rudimentary form of craftsmanship. Perhaps we were not as different as was commonly thought. \"Feel free to employ the King's seat, as is befitting of a man of the Man With the Compassionate Horns.\" As he named my master, I could sense a certain unease among the mud dwellers. Surely, they were ashamed of their savageness being contrasted with the purity of a divine force. I understood. I, too, had loathed my heathen ways. Yet I was saved as I entered into His service, as these barbarians would soon be saved. I was given a flask of wine and what appeared to be bread.

The helices go up at an angle of 20-25deg , connecting to each granal thylakoid at a bridge-like slit junction. The helicoids may widen as large sheets that link multiple grana , or narrow to tube-like bridges between grana. While different parts of the thylakoid system contain different membrane proteins , the thylakoid membranes are continuous and the thylakoid blank they enclose form a single continuous labyrinth.

In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations.

The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, 'Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States'. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" that are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test,\" to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities 'manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \"protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants,\" \"national treasures\" of \"artistic, historic or archaeological value\" and \"industrial and commercial property.\" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the 'fundamental pillars of a democratic society', against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate.

{"original_text": "Sorry, this is mostly applicable to folks from the US, but feel free to weigh in no matter what. I'll bullet-point for my reasoning: More good folks are killed via firearms than are saved by them. The vast majority of firearm deaths are via suicide, which has an incredibly high success rate compared to all other methods. Therefore since firearms cause more deaths than they prevent, firearms pose a net-loss for society. One major reason we believe we need firearms is the 2nd amendment. The 2nd amendment is essentially an axiom; in order to have a moral argument as to why we should have guns, I don't think \"because the 2nd amendment says so\" is compelling. If the 2nd amendment told us to punch babies, that wouldn't make it okay. Therefore whether or not firearms are truly acceptable must be for a reason outside of this. Our logical balance doesn't make sense. To paraphrase John Oliver, one guy tried to blow up a plane with a shoe and now we all take our shoes off at security. But so many people shoot up so many schools, and we still haven't done anything substantial about it. On a similar note, we invest how many trillions of dollars on the war on terror, and yet the amount of Americans killed via guns exceeds the amount killed via terrorism by an extraordinary amount. I've read Scalia's opinion in D.C. v. Heller (The most important guns case in modern times). I don't find the appeal to history compelling. It seems to me that times have changed so much that arguing what Thomas Jefferson was thinking and then applying it to semi-automatic and automatic weapons just doesn't make sense. For someone who claims to be a textualist, this appears to me to be a stretch. The 2nd amendment and it's current interpretation quashes any possibility of experimentation. I think part of the American experiment is to allow different states to try different things. One of the arguments for gun rights is \"what worked for Australia couldn't work for us.\" And yet one only needs to look at Chicago (the city banned some firearms, SCOTUS said that was unacceptable and ruled against Chicago's law) to see that we were never given a chance to figure out what worked. I would normally suggest an amendment if we wanted to clarify the 2nd amendment for modern times, but it seems to me that nobody will ever be convinced guns are bad (or good!) until we have a concrete application and see whether it works or not.

It seems to me that times have changed so much that arguing what Thomas Jefferson was thinking and then applying it to semi-automatic and automatic weapons scarce does n't make sense. For someone who claims to be a textualist , this look to me to be a stretch. The 2nd amendment and it 's current interpretation quashes any possibleness of experimentation. I think section of the American experiment is to allow different states to try different things. One of the arguments for gun right wing is `` what worked for Australia could n't work for us. `` And yet one only needs to look at stops ( the city banned some firearms , SCOTUS said that was unacceptable and ruled against stops 's law ) to see that we were never given a chance to figure out what worked. I would normally suggest an amendment if we wanted to clarify the 2nd amendment for modern times , but it seems to me that nobody will ever be convinced ordnance are bad ( or good ! ) until we have a concrete application and see whether it works or not.

To be clear, I am no fan of Huckabee, and I have nothing against our military or militaries in general. That said, I think he was dead on. I think most people who don't accept this do so because they think it's crass, and brutal. Well, yeah, but it's also absolutely true.

{"original_text": "Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in comparison to other nations in categories such as [infrastructure] , [poverty rates] , [education] , and so on. Usually, these show other nations, typically Scandinavian and other European countries, consistently coming out on top. This leads to a somewhat negative and unhealthy perception of America for both citizens and non-citizens that I think is unfair. This is because, in my view, there are 3 factors which hinder America's ability to keep up with its developed nation counter parts: Land Size Population Cultural Heterogeneity First, here is a top 5 list of the largest nations on Earth by square mileage, in order from largest to smallest: Russia Canada China United States Brazil The US is the 4th largest country on the planet, and as such, I think its ability to manage and update infrastructure is limited. A bullet train similar to those in Europe would be difficult in the US. Also, land from coast to coast is extremely diverse, ranging from plains, to mountains, to desert, to swamps, and so forth. Such a diverse biome requires diverse management of resources and is pretty difficult in my opinion. Now here's a top 5 list of countries by population, from largest to smallest: China India United States Indonesia Brazil Not only is America massive in terms of land area, it has a massive population as well. This high population puts financial strain on social nets, public education, and other public programs that can lead to problems. (This is not to say America wisely spends its money on its people, but that is a separate argument for another day). And yet compared to the other 4 most populous nations, it still maintains a high standard of living, relatively low poverty rate, and economic mobility. The only other country that hangs with America in both categories is China, which is massive in size and population. But America differs from China in one way, which is my third point a heterogeneous culture. The US was founded by immigrants, as a nation of immigrants, and diversity is only growing into the future. America features such a mixing pot of ethnicity and culture that it makes it difficult to enact programs that benefit everyone equally. I think this is most evident in education, where the US has the difficult task of creating a system that benefits every child in the best way possible. In China, a largely homogeneous population with high value on education should produce high results. And yet, despite having all three of these factors to consider, the United States is ranked [5th on the Human Development Index] as late as 2014. So, basically my argument is this The United States, being huge in size, huge in population, and having a heterogeneous culture, is at an instant disadvantage in comparison to other nations, and is doing pretty well for itself all things considered.

{"original_text": "Batman's strict no-killing policy has lead to the deaths of hundreds of people. Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who can stop the Joker. Additionally, it is obvious that Arkham cannot hold him. He has escaped countless times, and every time, Batman has to go recapture him (after he's killed or injured who-knows-how-many people). Ostensibly, Batman's no-killing policy is a self imposed check on his inner demons that he is sure will consume him if he gives into them. I believe that, in reality, he uses this policy as a security blanket he can cling to so that he doesn't have to get his hands dirty and make a difficult decision. I think he wraps up his own cowardice in a cloak of self-righteousness (albeit a fireproof, bulletproof cloak). Here are my main views 1) The only way to stop the Joker is to kill or permanently incapacitate him 2) Batman has a moral obligation to kill or incapacitate the Joker since the state can't or won't do it. 3) He bares responsibility for everyone the Joker harms. Important Points The Joker is responsible for everyone he kills. The full burden of each person's murder is on his head. This CMV in no way negates his responsibility for his actions. Batman is not equally as responsible as the Joker for the people he kills. I'm not attempting to assign a specific amount of blame to Batman.

I have driven near and far and have never give birth to take a toll road. I recently adventure into Pennsylvania for an internship and was absolutely flabbergasted by the toll roads. I take in always heard from people that they are good because they take in higher speed limits. A raft of the free highways I have been on have 70 mph speed limits and when I went into Pennsylvania , I paid 5. 00 to go 40mph on a `` highway '' for a humongous 2 miles. I also have gone through some other toll roads since my time here but that was the near obnoxious one. Anyways I just think they are pointless because in no way did it make my change of location more convenient. Maybe I just practise n't know enough about them but please change my view !

{"original_text": "As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one: They reduce the extent of any injuries caused by a bike accident Bike helmets are proven to make any injuries obtained greatly decreased. The effectiveness of helmets are found to be 85-88 in preventing serious injury. About 70-80 of accidents involve some damage to the head. It is estimated that if children ages 5-15 were forced to wear a helmet, 39,000 to 45,000 head injuries would be avoided, along with 18,000-55,000 face and scalp injuries. I could go on and on with these, but I don't have that much time. If you want more proof, just google \"bike helmet facts.\" I've also listed my sources below. Sources: (NSFW, for some reason there is a picture of a man and woman riding naked. Still good stuff on this page, though) Helmets do not interfere with riding the bike. Helmets, if they are the correct size, do not get in the way while riding the bike.

{"original_text": "This is a long one... I greatly appreciate any thoughtful responses, feel free to ask any clarifying questions needed- I've left out some of the evidence for my claims to keep this \"short\" I was thinking about this question in reference to a specific question I was asked a long time ago: If you are walking in a oark and you see a child drowning in a pond, are you morally obligated to save them (or assist them in any way)? For starters, obviously I would. I would also think it obvious that anyone who is able should. But that's not the question. It's very important that you keep in mind, I'm notasking about any of the following: Do you have a societal obligation to save them Would you feel obligated to help Do you have a responsibility to do so Would you judge someone for not saving them Should it be illegal to ignore them Again, I am not asking any of these questions, as I believe that any decent human would hop in and save the kid. I'll even suspend judgement if you want to take the time to take your shoes off and put your phone in them. I came to the conclusion that you are not in fact morally obligated to help. Consider the analogy between saving the drowning girl and using your time money to save starving children in another country. What is the difference? They are farther away, they are not part of your community, you can't see the help you provide, you can't see them suffer in the first place, you don't know for sure if you are helping by sending money, it would be much more difficult to provide direct assistance, they have longer to live from the time we would decide to help, they may recieve help from someone else. None of those reasons would be an excuse to ignore a moral obligation. If we truly believed that it was our moral obligation to help the drowning child, why would it not also be our obligation to help every other human in need according to our closest approximation of how we could theoretically devote our lives to helping the greatest possible number of people. It is of course possible that you believe this in which case almost every human ever is hugely immoral, but I think that defining morality in this way would make the word meaningless, and it is not useful - nor is it a reasonable definition for morality. On the other hand, there is a moral belief system that would treat morality as if you had no obligation to help anyone, and an unwarrented harm would be immoral, whereas helping people or leaving them alone would be considered positive or neutral respectively. If we accept this stance, than leaving the child to drown would be considered a morally neutral (or amoral) action. It would still be considered a horrible thing to do by most anyone, but people's emotional responses have no bearing on objective morality. (there may be exceptions for emotional distress caused by a person, but since our hypothetical passerby is not the cause of the child drowning, you cannot hold him accountable for the emotional consequences) This scenario is also closely related to the train thought experiment, where you are standing by the lever that switches the direction a train is going. On it's current path, it will hit five men. If you change the path, it will hit one man. By the logic I have put forth, it would be immoral to flip the lever, thus condemning the one man, but it would be morally neutral to let the train hit the five men (assuming that no further information or alternatives are available) I would have to reconsider this stance if the analogy were proven false, or a better explanation to the moral dilemmas were presented. I am also operating under the assumtion that morality is objective as it relates to humans, and therefor a principle must be established which applies equally to all scenarios in which your interpritation of what constitutes a moral action can be right or wrong, and is only up for interpritation in cases dealing with immoral agents in which actions that would be considered immoral (like murder) would be considered justified (like murdering someone who is going to murder you).", "text_perturb": "This is a farseeing one. . .

{"original_text": "I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is the far superior option. Cleanliness In this area, I prefer toilet paper for a few reasons. First of all, there is actual visual confirmation that you've got it all. With bidets you just have to keep spraying until you think you're good. And as the amount of wipingbidet-ing can vary greatly, the visual aspect is a great help. (I used a towel to dab afterwards, as toilet paper doesn't hold up against all the water.) Secondly, a bidet shouldn't be necessary as people (should) shower daily. Many people like to point out that bidets are better because they rinse away bacteria and other nastiness. But, a shower with actual soap and water and scrubbing should do that job much better than just water alone. \"But you wouldn't just wipe it away if you got some on your hands!\" No, and I don't think you'd just rinse it away either. You'd use soap and water and scrubbing. Another point, your hands are usually the first thing you use to touch something. Until you grab things with your bare ass, wiping is just as good. Comfort Good quality toilet paper is amazing. It's soft, thick, almost like Kleenex. Hell, you could wipe with Kleenex if you wanted. Point is that high quality stuff is glorious. On the other hand, you're getting a cold spray of water in a very sensitive area. Even if you have a super luxury bidet that uses heated water, it's still basically shooting water up your ass. Even low quality toilet paper is better than that. In a shower the water flows down, which is much less uncomfortable. With a bidet there's also the added trouble of being all drippy with water while you move to towel off. And unless you want to reach into the bowl with a towel while you're still sitting on it, you're going to have to at least move up to a squat to towel off. (Those with an air dryer feature may alleviate this somewhat, but toweling will probably still be necessary if the air hand dryers are anything to go by.) Price I understand bidets cost less. But for me and where I am in life, I can and will pay extra for quality. There must be many others who feel the same, or else only single ply sand paper toilet paper would exist. In this area bidets are better, but I think that if this is the reason someone buys a bidet it would be because they have to save money. Eco friendliness I think we're past the whole'save the trees' business. Reforestation is greater than reforestation in most of the world. Bidets may actually do more harm in low water and drought areas, if everyone dropped toilet paper and got bidets the gallons would add up. To clarify; I'm talking about a bidet for home use, that's built into the toilet. The bidets that are completely separate just seem impractical. Edit: The point here is that given a choice between a bidet and toilet paper, toilet paper is better. In situations where there's no other alternatives, of course one will be used over the other.

{"original_text": "First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in.

{"original_text": "Please note before reading: Please do not downvote my comments and replies on basis of disagreement. I've done several CMV's where I was the clear minority in terms of viewpoint, and got downvoted on nearly every post. Due to Reddit's karma system, this makes me wait a period of 7 minutes in between replies if my karma is low, and makes it more difficult for me to respond to everyone (the more karma you have, the less time you need to wait to post). If I act like a dick to you, act irrational, or say something logically fallacious, I implore you to downvote me, but I'd really like to be able to discuss with everybody and not be held back by my inability to reply (and consequently hear replies). Okay, onto my view. I'm not worried about the US government spying on citizens, for the following reasons. 1. I don't necessarily \"have nothing to hide,\" but I don't expect that there is literally a person on a computer looking through what I post to Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook (or what porn I look at). I have some personal things I wouldn't want an actual person to know or look through, but I feel entirely comfortable with a machine using a CTRL-F function to search for terrorist activity, or other organized illegal activities since I don't commit any major crime. I know a lot of people are worried about the government seeing people torrenting things illegally or watching moviesshows illegally on the internet, but considering how widely this is done and how nonexistent people are prosecuted for it based on the governments ability to view all this, I'm not worried about it. I don't do drugs, but if I did and tried to buy drugs over FB or text, I doubt the government would even care. We have rtrees for instance, thousands of people openly doing minor illegal things and the government doesn't care enough to try and arrest them. 2. I remember hearing during Rand Paul's filibuster that there has been terrorist activity stopped by government spying on people. I think government spying still has an effect as a deterrent (terrorists can't use media to communicate, and therefore it makes terrorist activity harder to commit. I also heard during the filibuster that the government was using spying to take down organized crime. I'm not worried about that, considering I'm not involved in organized crime and therefore am not worried about it. (I'd like to point out here, that it's not really a view regarding sympathy or empathy towards criminals and what rights they should have to privacy, but simply my feeling of worry about being spied on). I don't view the NSA spying on druglords to be much different than wire taps or undercover officers. 3. In addition to the above, I have the view that Islamic extremism is, as of ISIS' international attacks (or extremist Muslims inspired by ISIS at least), a legitimate threat to the United States. There have been US citizens that have gone to fight for ISIS and local Islamic extremist attacks, and believe the US should be able to spy on their communications. They have claimed to have thousands of people in the US, and while that may be an exaggeration, I don't believe it to be unbelievable considering they have had 150 individuals that have travelled to Syria to fight for ISIS (Source:). I would expect if many people are willing to take the trouble to travel to another country to fight others, it's not unexpected that they more would stay in the US to try and perform terrorist activity here considering it would be easier. 4.

Happy CMVing!", "text_perturb": "Please note before reading : Please do not downvote my comments and replies on basis of dissension. I 've done several CMV 's where I exist the clear minority in terms of viewpoint , and got downvoted on nearly every post. Due to Reddit 's karma system , this work me wait a period of 7 minutes in between replies if my karma is low , and work it more difficult for me to respond to everyone ( the more karma you have , the less time you need to wait to post ). If I pretend like a dick to you , pretend irrational , or say something logically fallacious , I implore you to downvote me , but I 'd really like to be able to discuss with everybody and not be held back by my inability to reply ( and consequently hear replies ). Okay , onto my survey. I 'm non worried about the US government spying on citizens , for the following reasons. 1. I act n't necessarily `` have nothing to hide , '' but I act n't expect that there is literally a person on a computer looking through what I post to Reddit , Twitter , and Facebook ( or what porn I look at ). I have some personal things I would n't want an actual person to know or look through , but I feel entirely comfortable with a machine using a CTRL-F function to search for terrorist activity , or other organized illegal bodily function since I do n't commit any major crime. I know a lot of people are worried about the government get word people torrenting things illegally or watching moviesshows illegally on the internet , but considering how widely this is done and how nonexistent people are prosecuted for it based on the governments ability to view all this , I 'm not worried about it. I do n't do drugs , but if I did and tried to grease ones palms drugs over FB or text , I doubt the government would even care. We have rtrees for instance , thousands of people openly doing minor illegal things and the authorities does n't care enough to try and arrest them. 2. I remember hearing during Rand paul the apostle 's filibuster that there has been terrorist activity stopped by government spying on people. I think government spying still has an effect as a deterrent ( terrorists ca n't expend media to communicate , and therefore it makes terrorist activity harder to commit. I also heard during the filibuster that the government was use spying to take down organized crime. I 'm non worried about that , considering I 'm non involved in organized crime and therefore am non worried about it. ( I 'd like to point out here , that it 's not really a view regarding sympathy or empathy towards criminals and what rights they should have to privacy , but but my feeling of worry about being spied on ). I do n't consider the NSA spying on druglords to be much different than wire taps or undercover officers. 3. In addition to the above , I have the view that Islamic extremism is , as of inter services intelligence ' international attacks ( or extremist Muslims inspired by inter services intelligence at least ) , a legitimate threat to the United States. There have comprise US citizens that have gone to fight for ISIS and local Islamic extremist attacks , and believe the US should be able to spy on their communications. They have claimed to have thousands of people in the US , and while that may make up an exaggeration , I do n't believe it to make up unbelievable considering they have had 150 individuals that have travelled to Syria to fight for ISIS ( Source : ). I would expect if many people are willing to take the bother to travel to another country to fight others , it 's not unexpected that they more would stay in the US to try and perform terrorist activity here considering it would be easier. 4. I 'm not worried about the politics knowing my political views. I broadcast them publicly on Facebook , and considering our country 's devotion to free speech as well as multiple political parties , I cause n't view any dissent to be any threat to my well-being.

{"original_text": "The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line, but it is often well after substantial ambiguous conversation. For the purpose of this CMV, I will grant that a fetus is a human person. My views: 1. Abortion may or may not be morally permissible, though I lean towards permissible. I don't really want to discuss this aspect of it, but it's here for some background on my position. 2. Abortion should be legal, based primarily on my foundational belief on bodily autonomy. To change my view, you will probably need to change my belief that the mother's legal right to control her own body overrides the fetus' (or child's) right to use them. One of the main objections to legal abortion is the sense that the woman has incurred a sort of responsibility to the child by engaging in sex (for this CMV, I'd prefer to only consider consensual sex). While this may be true, I see it at most to be a moral obligation, not a legal one. The best analogy I've heard is as follows: Let's say you are driving recklessly and run over a pedestrian. The ambulance arrives and does a quick blood test and determines that unless you donate a pint of blood to that pedestrian, he will die. You hate needles and refuse. At the moment, you cannot be legally compelled to donate your blood. If you can't be compelled to donate blood (which is almost completely safe) to save the life of someone he recklessly endangered, a woman should not be required to donate her internal organs for 9 months to a fetus to keep it alive. EDIT: There are probably other ways in which my view could be changed, but here is the conversation that changed my view first: ugarnteller: So, let's say there was a teleporter accident that caused the second head. You knew it was a risk going in. It will take 9 months for science to clone a body to host the head. Are you still free to kill it? My realization as I thought through the implications: This is again, a very difficult question and I had to put some thought into it before responding. Since we're into sci-fi land, lets look at the probable scenario: In a world where teleportation is a common mode of transport and head grafting was a possible (if somewhat uncommon) outcome, I wouldn't want to travel without knowing that whoever I traveled with (assuming these are the only people who get head-grafted) agreed to keep my head alive until my replacement body could be found. This would be a sort of additional agreement reached between the teleporters. Even in this scenario, I would be very hesitant make it a default law.... but I could easily see that it could become that way if enough people used teleportation and the head-grafting continued to happen. So, I guess the short answer is that I am of the opinion that it should be possible to sign away a certain level of bodily autonomy to secure a level of personal safety. After all, you could be the grafted head next time. This seems to severely impact my position, since an actual analogous scenario would be where the teleporter picks up a random person (who did not choose to teleport) and has their head grafted to their body.

{"original_text": "For the purpose of this post, I am defining \"capitalism\" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. \"Socialism\" is defined as a system in which the government owns the means of production, and distributes all things necessary for decent quality of life (food, water, shelter, education, health care, etc) for free to all minors and any adult either working, seeking work, or enrolled in school. I understand that this definition is more specific than the true definition of socialism, but I want to preempt any arguments suggesting that people won't look for work if everything is provided for them anyway; they won't be provided for unless they contribute. Also, please note that I am not advocating any specific system of governance; I don't want a debate about the merits of direct democracy. Assume that the system of governance is something effective and relatively democratic, unless there is a compelling reason why my definition of socialism ensures ineffective government. With that out of the way, here is my justification. I believe that capitalism ensures exploitation of the lower-classes. The winners in a capitalist system are nearly always those who were born into relative wealth already. Even the rags-to-riches stories of our time, such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, they were all born into at least lower-middle class. Those trapped in poverty are normal people, who usually work much harder than the people at the top, and get nothing for it. I don't mean to put down high-ranking executives, or other wealthy individuals, but I think that if capitalism is designed to benefit those who work hard, it's doing a shoddy job. Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair. And that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression. Not only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a \"Green!\" or \"Eco-Friendly\" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot). So, with those reasons put out for why capitalism is bad, here's why I think socialism is better. Socialism prevents needless death and suffering by ensuring that everyone who contributes gets everything they need for a healthy life.

Happy CMVing!", "text_perturb": "For the intention of this post , I am defining `` capitalism '' as a relatively free market system , with private ownership of the means of production. `` Socialism '' is defined as a system in which the government owns the means of product , and distributes all things necessary for decent quality of life ( food , water , shelter , education , health care , etc ) for free to all minors and any adult either working , seeking work , or enrolled in school. I understand that this definition be more specific than the true definition of socialism , but I want to preempt any arguments suggesting that people wo n't look for work if everything be provided for them anyway ; they wo n't be provided for unless they contribute. Also , please note that I am not advocating any specific system of governance ; I do n't want a argument about the merits of direct democracy. Assume that the system of governance follow something effective and relatively democratic , unless there follow a compelling reason why my definition of socialism ensures ineffective government. With that out of the way , here follow my justification. I believe that capitalism ensures using of the lower-classes. The winners in a capitalist system are most always those who were born into relative wealth already. Even the rags-to-riches stories of our time , such as Steve Jobs , Bill Gates , they live all born into at least lower-middle class. Those trapped in poverty are normal people , who usually work much harder than the people at the top , and get nil for it. I do n't mean to assign down high-ranking executives , or other wealthy individuals , but I think that if capitalism is designed to benefit those who work hard , it 's doing a shoddy job. Look at all the people in America , one of the world 's wealthiest countries , who sustain to work two or three jobs to stay afloat , through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It 's exactly not fair. And that 's the real problem with capitalist economy ; it is n't fair. Global capitalist economy causes enormous waste , while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US , and non-European cultures around the world , proving the system is not only if oppressive of impoverished people , but also a system of racial oppression. non only is it bad for people , but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to essay to help the environment. Sure , a corporation can gravel a few extra sales by slapping a `` Green ! '' or `` Eco-Friendly '' sticker on their product , but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help , but they exclusively go so far , and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations ( and often less worker-protection , to boot ). So , with those ground put out for why capitalism is bad , here 's why I think socialism is better. Socialism prevents needless destruction and suffering by ensuring that everyone who contributes gets everything they need for a healthy life. Socialism ends cyclical impoverishment by giving everyone a chance at education , without worries about putting food on the table. Socialism is better for rewarding the hard-workers and punishing the slackers , because without unfair head starts going to rich kids entering the workforce , the real cream will rise to the top ( there would be variable wages and such ; the government employers could offer raises and promotions to their full workers ). Socialism is better for the surroundings , because the government could have direct control , and would have much more incentive to manage the surroundings in sustainable ways than short-term-minded corporations. I guess I can go further in depth in my answer , if needed. I 'm looking for a good argumentation , and maybe a change of heart. Change my view ! EDIT : OK all , so I have been persuaded by a combination of factors that socialism as I define it is not as good as capitalism with generous welfare insurance and heavy regulations ( think Nordic model ).

{"original_text": "While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously \"earning\" the respect of less experienced and established people completely ludicrous. It should be the other way around, if only for practical reasons (the respect of older people tend to be far more valuable). Now, I'm in no way denying that younger folks have valid and interesting contribution to make. I think a fresh perspective coupled with energy and enthusiasm can be an exceptional driving force. Nor am I denying that older folks can be complete assholes because their certainly can. However, I could never bring myself to expect older, more experience and better established people to prove themselves to me. Neither can I see a reason to prove myself to younger people today. I expect respect the same way my father or professors did. Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers. Simply put, I find this phrase respect is earned, not given is most often used pompously by younger people to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason. To my eye, this attitude is the product of four big misconceptions: 1) Older people demand respect because of their age and age by itself isn't worthy of respect. I do agree that age by itself isn't a quality worthy of respect, but I don't think older folks demand respect in virtue of their age alone either. Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life. 2) Showing respect and deference to others cost me something. Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did. 3) I know these people are whether or not they're deserving of my respect. Assuming anything worthy of respect about someone is readily available is a common mistake.

{"original_text": "Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate \"News\" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand \"BuzzFeed News\" as separate from the rest of BuzzFeed, it's alright. Still not going to use it for my news (or anything really) but definitely see it in a new light. Thanks for the perspective and interesting discussion guys! Buzzfeed is a terrible news organization. They are basically the death of journalism. They focus on vague clickbait headlines for the sole purpose of gather views ultimately to make the most ad money possible. I feel this is clearly a sign of a lack of journalistic integrity. Headlines are meant to inform, not confuse. \"Obama said something AMAZING at the state of the union, and you won't believe the reaction!\" What is that?! That's not informing me, bringing me valuable information. It's vague, biased, uninformative, and purely designed just to get a click. Buzzfeed also focuses on native advertisement and meaningless lists which makes it dangerous for the uniformed who cannot discern between what is news and what isn't and ultimately lose a valuable skill in determining what is a good source and what is not. They also plagiarize, which immediately makes an institution lose all credibility. I've had this view for a while and mostly kept to myself about it, but last night someone brought the topic up and to my surprise a journalism student actually started to praisedefend BuzzFeed. So I figured I would post the big counter points she made and why they aren't legitimate. 1. BuzzFeed has a large base \"BuzzFeed has revolutionized how news organizations attract viewership and the mass consumption of BuzzFeed show it's prowess in journalism. Journalism is about consumption\" This is a silly point. Just because a lot of people read BuzzFeed does not mean it is a legitimate news organization. Sure, it's impressive BuzzFeed can attract so many people to their site through social media and clickbait, but so what? The New York Times could slap a big naked lady on their front page and I'm sure it would increase viewership, but I think we can all agree that doesn't make it better news. And I don't believe journalism is about consumptiongetting the most consumption. If the goal is to just get people to readbuy their articles, there is no incentive to generate good news. Everything will just be tabloids. 2. Every news organization is copying BuzzFeed \"The Washington Post, CNN, Fox News are all scrambling to adopt BuzzFeed's revolutionary model. They can't keep up with BuzzFeed's dominance. They're copying BuzzFeed because it's so good!\" Yea, can't argue there. All these news organizations are copying BuzzFeed. And that hurts journalism. Now all sources are turning to clickbait baloney. BuzzFeed is killing the market because they don't have integrity and are willing to make meaningless posts that are designed to go viral. So now in order to compete, all other news organizations must do the same, which hurts journalism. It is now quite hard to find an unbiased, un-editorialized news source. 3.They do really good pieces \"I'll admit 90 of BuzzFeed is stupid, meaningless posts, but they actually do really good pieces. They've started a whole field of'explanatory news' and really tries to educate a reader. Most news organizations just assume you know all the background of a piece, but most don't. So these pieces really help the public understand current event.\" That's great! They should focus on that then! Just because there are good pieces dotted around the site, doesn't mean it's a good news source. If I see a guy down a steak I'm not going to eat his poop just because there might be some prime rib in there. The New York Times does similar things, where they'll have a 30 page story on something like an avalanche explaining the mountain, back country skiing, the days leading up to it, the backstory to all involved. It's great stuff and they don't have \"17 Pizza's that look like Ohio\" as the next article cued up. I think it's also bad because it gives BuzzFeed credibility. So they can point to the handful of articles and say they're real news when people call them out for their mass quantities of meaningless malarky. 4.They get people to read the news \"Sure, there's a lot of crap, but it gets people reading the news, which traditional media doesn't do. The clickbait gets people reading! You realize it's crap because you're an educated person who goes to a private college, but most people don't. So it doesn't really matter because those people now read the news where they wouldn't have before.\" It's true. People who didn't read the news do now thanks to BuzzFeed. But shouldn't we focus on giving those people an education, teach them to evaluate news sources, give them the tools to discern bias and editorialization? Why are we bringing news down to the lowest common denominator just so more people read it? If we ruin journalism in the process, does it really matter if more people have access to it? Also, I think it's really dangerous to do so because now those who previously didn't read the news have BuzzFeed as their introduction to newsjournalism. Those people who aren't educated or didn't read the news now are much more susceptible to native advertisement. So now there's possibly a whole host of people who think \"This diet pill made these 12 fitness instructors resign because they couldn't compete!\" is real news and not just advertisement for a useless sugar pill. 5.It's a new platform, the next evolution \"You just don't understand this new platform. It's like how print journalism first went on the web. People said the same things you're saying back then but it turned out fine. You just need to realize it's a new age for journalism and you must adapt.\" Print journalism going on the web was just that. Putting the news on the web. It wasn't changing the what people receive or altering news or putting in ads that look like news. It was just giving a new out for people to access news from. I know social media is big and is a powerful tool, but you can use it without making this clickbait nothings. Tweet out the headline with a link, have a'share on facebook' button on the article, post it to reddit. Use the tools to increase access to information, not to destroy it. I'm sure one day well all have personal holograms and that will be a new platform for news. But a hologram of \"3 of the cutest puppies that show black lives matter\" still isn't news. That's the major points I head in defense of BuzzFeed. There were a few more but all under those general points and nothing that CMV. I think the real dangerous part of all this is that all those points I just listed are being taught in journalism classes at renowned institutions. BuzzFeed is now the accepted and taught method for delivering the news. I fear this could be the death of journalism. I always thought \"BuzzFeed is kinda dumb, but hey, if people like looking at silly lists, who am I to say they can't.\" But now these silly lists are being hailed as the height of contemporary journalism! It seems were doomed to editorialized, plagiarized, uninformative clickbait for our news from now on. Anyway, just looking for someone to change my view. I actually would like it if someone changed my view because it would be great to go look at silly lists all day. Seems like a good way to kill time but I don't want to support BuzzFeed.

{"original_text": "Marriage as a word comes from the Middle english word mariage, which according to sources from Wikipedia, comes from around CE. Word comes from another Old French word then to a Latin word maritare, which describes a husband and wife. Adding on top of that, many modern religions using the word to describe the ceremony as a marriage between one man and one woman, I see that the word Marriage is intrinsically religious. Now moving to modern day, Marriage is changing as many people are adding tochanging the meaning to a word that many people use as a religious word.

Now have a courtgovernment adding tochanging that definition of that word, this is where I believe the whole issue is. The issue with people not wanting gay marriage based off religious beliefs is because a word is being used for something that it does not mean to them. Marriage isfrom religion and should keep it that way. We need to rename Marriage in the government to remove this part of the issue that the anti-gay marriage community has with it. Now I know it still won't remove the whole problem that the anti-gay community has with gay marriage but I believe it will remove everyone who dislikes that this word, that is so entrenched in religion, is being redefined by a government decision. I even see a huge problem with these, I am not religious and completely for two consenting people getting married, no matter whowhat they are. The government needs to change its vocabulary so that when you want your union to be legal, you go get a Civil Union (Or whatever we call it) from the government.

There's tons of news, screenshots, subreddit with speculation and discussion. (eg. Check out rdragonage for all the DA:I info you could want.) It's very easy to get a good idea of what you're buying. Also, this risk is almost completely taken out of the picture if you pre-order games from franchises or companies you know and like (Saints Row, Borderlands, Tomb Raider, etc.) and don't throw money at unknown devs. \"Just buy it when it comes out, after you see the reviews.\" You can usually see many reviews beforehand, or get an idea for the feel of the game with methods in my previous point.

{"original_text": "This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are! Juveniles are given special treatments in trials, there is a focus on rehabilitation an integration back into society. This makes a lot of sense to me, children are still learning and don't have much freedom in life. Many of their choices and actions are an immediate cause of their situation, and removing them from that could potentially help. Not to mention, the focus on punishment in adult courts can likely lead to training a kid to be an offender for life, Trying a kid as an adult circumvents all of that, and ignores the fact that society expects persons under 18 years of age to need additional supervision and warrant more rehabilitation in the case of crimes. It seems so juvenile that someone who commits a worse crime (and is more in need of rehab) would magically be considered an adult just because of severity. Do actions make someone an adult, or age and experience? EDIT: I think it is also important to consider there is a growing amount of evidence that states adolescence continues up until 25[1]. Also, many cases that have children tried as adults aren't emancipated minors, it's typically just due to severity. I would consider an emancipated minor tried as an adult more logical, but possibly more morally wrong for a society to do. Emancipation isn't generally a happy thing, and often due to poor circumstances.... more rehabilitation would likely make sense, but I see how it would be logical for a system.

Juveniles are given special treatments in trials , there is a focus on rehabilitation an integration back into society. This makes a lot of sense to me , children are still hear and do n't have much freedom in life. Many of their choice and actions are an immediate cause of their situation , and removing them from that could potentially help. Not to mention , the focus on punishment in adult courts can likely lead to training a kid to be an offender for life , Trying a kid as an adult circumvents all of that , and ignores the fact that society look persons under 18 years of age to need additional supervision and warrant more rehabilitation in the case of crimes. It seems so juvenile that someone who commits a worse crime ( and comprise more in need of rehab ) would magically be considered an adult just because of severity. Do actions make someone an adult , or age and experience ? EDIT : I think it is also important to consider there is a growing total of evidence that states adolescence continues up until 25 [ 1 ]. Also , many cases that have children tried as adults are n't emancipated minors , it 's typically just due to hardship. I would consider an emancipated minor tried as an grownup more logical , but possibly more morally wrong for a society to do. Emancipation is n't generally a happy thing , and often referable to poor circumstances. . . . more rehabilitation would likely make sense , but I take care how it would be logical for a system.

{"original_text": "EDIT: Haha the amount of downvotes on this is crazy. Looks like I hit a nerve or something. First, I define \"enthusiastic consent\" the state of consenting to sex not only technically (i.e. saying yes regardless of context) but also with clear demonstration that you are excited and happy about the prospect. It's a big deal in many feminist spaces, most prominently including the feminist subreddits here (ie. twoxchromosomes, raskwomen, rfeminism, etc). A lot of feminists I have spoken to would like to see a society where there's a legal requirement for one party to get enthusiastic consent before doing anything physical with another party. Not getting enthusiastic consent would be, in this ideal society, seen as rape and would lead to criminal charges. This would include cases where the girl either participated and didn't say no, meekly said yes, reluctantly agreed, said yes after saying no a few times, etc. First of all, I strongly disagree with the entire concept of enthusiastic consent because I think it is infantalizing women and denying them agency - basically telling them that when they say \"yes\" it isn't enough, they need to be clearer about it. If a woman is just naturally meek? Tough luck. But that's not the main part of my post. I believe that if we as a society teach our children enthusiastic consent and pressure people to follow it, then it is only logical that we apply the principle to other things besides sex. Why put up sex on a pedestal? Why is sex the only situation where we should expect a person to be excited about what they're doing? Why do we put up sex as such as sacred cow? - If a customer is buying a product, they should have to legally and morally demonstrate enthusiastic consent. If a store owner manages to persuade them of the product's viability and they finally give up and say \"oh, okay, I'll get it\" - then the storeowner should be charged with theft. It's basically a mugging at that point because the customer bought the product reluctantly, right? At the very least, the storeowner should be shamed and ostracized by society for his actions. - Politicians should not be allowed to aggressively campaign and try hard to convince fence-sitting voters to vote for them. That would be considered mental pressure. If a person votes for a politician reluctantly (ie. \"well, he's the least of two evils after being approached repeatedly by that politician's supporters, frequently handed pamphlets, etc - then the politician and hisher supporters should be arrested. After all, the voter was pressured into supporting that politician, right? The voter didn't do so with enthusiasm. A lot of feminists should see this as coercion. These are just two examples of what I honestly believe is a logical continuation of \"enthusiastic consent.\" There is no rational basis for limiting that concept to just sex, if we accept it as a society. To be clear, I don't support such a society. My argument is that the feminists who aggressively spread the concept of enthusiastic consent should logically want to apply it to other areas as well - pretty much any situation where a person is doing something unenthusiastically after being persuaded. Please change my view. TL;DR: Enthusiastic consent, if we accept it as a society, shouldn't be limited to sex. It is only logical to apply it to a variety of other situations, basically anytime someone does something after being mentally pressured. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"original_text": "This type of post has probably already been made a handful of times but I wanted to include some of my own thoughts. I live in the UK, so I have grown up in a country that does provide universal healthcare. I firmly believe in this model from an ethical and social standpoint. I've recently started reading the book Freakonomics. I wanted to see some discussions of the book on reddit, and I came across an AmA of the author, Steven Levitt. Somebody asked him his views on universal healthcare, to which he replied; 'I'm not so sure about universal healthcare. what i think we really need is for people to pay a big chunk of their own health care costs so the whole system starts to act more like a market and less like an entitlement. when health care is 20 of GDP, we can't treat it like an all you can eat buffet.' Now, I'm not ranting or saying I flat out disagree with his statement factually, because I do not know enough about financial economics to do so, but as somebody who believes universal healthcare \"should\" be a human right, or 'entitlement' as Steven Levitt has put it, I struggle to understand how humanity as a whole would benefit from persisting with privatised health care. Essentially, to change my view, I would need to be convinced that privatised health care actually does have longstanding benefits for humanity, and not just for the 'economy'. Perhaps sustaining the economy and longevity of humanity come hand in hand, but I've always felt privatised health care primarily serves the rich who own it, and to deny healthcare to somebody who cannot afford it seems outright inhumane to me. Perhaps somebody could show me privatised healthcare actually does benefit humanity as a whole, and not just a small percentage. EDIT: I was asked to link the post that 'changed my view' the most, so here it is. Here is the post that I awarded a 'delta' quite early on. Admittedly I perhaps could have been more involved in the thread but I was quite literally overwhelmed with the amount of replies, to the point that the same types of responses were pouring through, deeming it almost impossible to identify which further posts would be deserving of another delta. Although my view is not changed in that I still believe as a society we should work towards everybody having 'free' access to basic healthcare, I am now aware of the implications of a 'human right', and how that could have serious adverse effects. I'm sorry if I was not totally compliant with the rules of the thread, but overall I see it as a success as it made me see things in a different perspective, and perhaps others have learnt from it as much I have.

{"original_text": "The issue of blacks being \"disproportionately affected\" by police violence is simple. Black people have only have civil rights for 50 years or so. Without civil rights it's kind of hard to get a decent job, or get a quality education. This leads to generational poverty. Many white people have at least someone in their family who could bail them out in a financial pinch. Many black people do not have that. Imagine if everyone in your immediate family that you could reach out to for help was just as poor as you. While this is a reality for whites as well, it is a harsh reality for a larger number of blacks. When you have generational poverty, it's a lot harder to break out of poverty yourself, when you have no positive influences and noone to support you while you go to school, or teach you etc. When you are in poverty, you tend to be more desperate and commit more crimes. When you commit more crimes, you tend to interact with the police more. The more desperate you are, the more violent crimes you commit, and the more lethal the response from police. It is true, black people do commit a disproportionate number of crimes compared to white people, but they also are disproportionately poorer, which as I stated leads to desperation. (NOTE: There are more white criminals than black criminals, but only because black people are a minority. Black people are proportionately charged with crimes more than white people) Am I excusing the behavior of criminals? No, I am simply cosigning those that trumpet the \"black crime statistics\" as it is indeed a societal problem, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the color of their skin or genetics, and everything to do with cause and effect over the last 150 years. Am I saying we should feel white guilt? Fuck no, I sure as hell don't. Even the most persecuted members of this country have it far better than the starving people in other countries. It is what it is. The only way out of this mess, in my opinion, is to fund all schools equally. Give an equal share of tax dollars to the rich schools as well as the inner city ones. Then our next generation might have a chance at producing less criminals (of any race). Why does Beverly Hills High need a day spa, when Compton High can't afford working computers? I'm not advocating a re-distribution of wealth, but when it comes to government provided services, they should all be provided equally, especially something as crucial as this. I am absolutely against giving blanket handouts to poor people. I am not a fan of public assistance. Technically though, we are all on the public assistance dole unless you send your kids to private school. If you want to break the cycle of poverty, provide kids of all socioeconomic classes a fair chance. Giving special college grants to people of a specific, disadvantaged race or class is worthless, because at that point they already received an inferior education from their crappy public school, and by letting them into your college with a lower score you are lowering the standard for everyone. Invest all the NAACPaffirmative action college grant BS into public schools instead so they can get into college on their own merit. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Men work almost triple the amount of overtime hours than women. Men work more standard hours than women. Women take more sick days off work than men. Women are more likely than men to take several years of maternity leave off of work. A small percentage of women undergo severe PMS and consequently work at a diminished capacity for several days of each month. To use anecdotal evidence, yesterday I came in to work, to find that all 8 garbages were completely filled. This was strange, since the closing crew is supposed to take out the garbages every night. I asked my coworker why no one had done the garbages last night, and I was effectively told that only girls were working the closing shift, and none of them wanted to touch the garbages because they thought it was gross. So I had to take out 8 garbages first thing in the morning, because I was a man. Additionally, the parking lot was overflowing with trash that had spilled out of the over-packed garbage cans, but none of the girls had done the usual nightly responsibility of sweeping, since they thought it was a man's job as well.

{"original_text": "To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, you can't simply say it's disgusting, because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting, and society has decided that people's rights shouldn't be inhibited by the disgust of others. Incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children, but marriage is not about reproduction. Maybe there's some psychological affliction behind it, but homosexuality used to be classified as a disorder as well, but psychologists realized the error of their ways as it became socially acceptable. Of course, any religious objections are right out. So with the last defenses against gay marriage dismantled, I'm left without any good reason why siblings should marry each other.

However , any arguments I would normally use against set aside incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example , you ca n't simply say it 's disgusting , because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting , and society has decided that people 's right should n't be inhibited by the disgust of others. incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children , but marriage is not about reproduction. Maybe there 's some psychological affliction behind it , but homosexuality used to be classified as a disorder as well , but psychologist realized the error of their ways as it became socially acceptable. Of course , any religious objections represent right out. So with the last defenses against gay marriage dismantled , I 'm left without any good reason why siblings should conjoin each other.

{"original_text": "We've all heard the saying that a Jack of All Trades is a Master of None. I'm not here to say that this is completely true and that if you are good at many things you will never be a \"master\" at some skill or aspect of your life. What I am willing to argue is that benefits of being a Jack of All Trades far outweighs the benefits of being a master of one or few \"trades.\" For starters, the possibility of finding the thing that truly makes you happy and satisfied in life is lessened quite significantly if your endeavors are honed into a certain subject at an early age. The amount of time you spend on a certain skill, hobby, or whatever it may be is inversely related on the amount of time you spend on other aspects of your life. It is my opinion that when you decide on your calling and devote yourself almost entirely to it, you miss out on other precious and interesting opportunities that your life could include otherwise. There is no doubt in my mind that abundant success in life is generated by the willingness to make a sacrifices for the thing that you believe that you want the most. It is up to the individual to decide what matters to them the most. Personally though, I think this is such a misguided approach to life that often leaves people feeling unfulfilled when they approach an advanced age. Is \"success\" in life really that valuable to humans that they are willing to give up so much of their time to a specific task? The need to be recognized and respected as a master of a particular aspect of life is a major driving factor of the sacrifices people make. A Jack of All Trades in my opinion does not mean you have to be great or even good at the things that you try once, or even do on a regular basis. For sanity's sake though, let's just say a Jack of All Trades is \"good\" at many things and a Master is \"great\" at one thing. When you set your focus on being great at one aspect of your life, there is the potential to backseat so many other important things in your life. I think, perhaps, this is best explained with an example. I have a co-worker who is one of the most vocally well-versed, decorated, and revered employees at the company at which I am employed. I am still quite young, and I just graduated college and he is one of my mentors. Working with him has really shown me what true mastery looks like. However, he spends at least 60 hours a week at work for no real reason other than the fact that he is potentially obsessed with his work. At his age, I know for a fact he would rather be spending time with his grand kids; he doesn't view time the same way most others do, and as a result ends up leaving the office at 7 o'clock every night. I try not to work overtime unless we are really running behind on a project, because while I love my job, I don't feel the need to devote myself fully to the task. As a result, I am able to focus on so much else and I am not constantly thinking about one specific thing. The ability to detach myself from my career after I leave the office (or job site) really seems to subconsciously effect the rest of my day. I feel more energized when I workout and I don't mind studying other things or brushing up on languages other than English. I also get the opportunity to socialize more with friends when I leave work on time. Having weekends off means I have the potential to do whatever I want and I can pick up new hobbies along the way. So in short I am sacrificing the potential to be great at one thing for the potential to be good (or maybe even just experience) many other things. Please don't relegate this to being a work-a-holic and not being a work-a-holic. This was purely a life example that directly relates to the topic at hand. I am sure it is possible to be a Master of one or more things and still be good at a lot of other things, but my main point is that a Jack of All Trades is a much more interesting and fulfilling approach to life than dedication to a singular practice. Edit Here is the delta, thanks AnecdotallyExtant I will change your view with a single diagram. It will demonstrate that in order to become a master of one, a person must first become a Jack of all. As an anecdotal example: I am myself somewhere right around the transition between the eighth and ninth picture in that diagram. But I am also the handiest person I know around the house. I can and regularly do fox everything in my house nearly worthless with cars, but the home I'm solid. So again, to become a master of a single trade, one must first become a jack of all. Or one cannot understand his or her own trade out of context. This is why we start our educations in kindergarten and not in graduate studies. A wide, solid, strong and synthetic knowledge base is an absolute a priori necessity. Which means that it can only follow that a master of one is superior, because it includes a thorough training in the jack of all. Please read below if you want to see the diagram.

{"original_text": "Throwaway account, my main is used for school. I'm 28, male, and a grad student (chemistry). I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She frequently brings up marriage and talks about how she believes I'll never propose to her, and I've told her that I'm honestly not sure how I feel about the whole concept of marriage. I would have no problem staying with her for my entire life, but I just don't understand how a ring and a piece of paper makes any difference. Let me outline my preconceptions here: My parents' marriage fell apart due to infidelity and divorce. I watched my mom cheat on my dad, take all his money in court, and leave him psychologically damaged until the day he died. Admittedly it has me a bit scared. Here are the benefits I often hear claimed about marriage, along with my response to them: More sex: We've been like bunnies for the whole relationship (at least twice a day) and honestly I have a pretty low sex drive. It's already more than enough. Children: I don't want kids, don't have kids, and am 100 sterile by choice. Nothing to do about it. She is equally happy to go without them. Added financial benefit tax breaks: We already contribute equally to the relationship in terms of finances. We end up paying for everything about 5050. Tax breaks? Ok, sure, but that's not going to sell me on it right off the bat. Now here are some drawbacks I often see cited about marriage, along with my response: Expense: A ring is supposed to cost three month's salary?! A wedding costs over 10,000?! I'm a grad student, for crying out loud. This kind of stuff is absolutely not affordable, and even if it was it seems like a huge waste just to conform to a social norm. Paying more for a little bit of metal and rock than for a decent used car seems absolutely insane to me. Divorce Risk: Statistics don't lie. I have a 5050 chance of going through exactly what my late father did. I hate seeing how sad the thought of just being my girlfriend forever (but not my wife) makes her. I love this girl a lot, but I am also a very rational and logical person and can't seem to find the personal justification for marriage. Please, try to change my view - and thank you.

{"original_text": "My post is inspired by [this article] in which a major politician proposes allowing college students to sell \"shares\" of their future earnings to investors in exchange for funding their education. I have seen people criticize this system as one of \"indentured servitude,\" presumably because for a period of years students could not be released from the requirement to pay a portion of their earnings to the investor (s). However, the current system of student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, amounting to a lifetime obligation anyway (or longer, if they die early and there are co-signers on the loan). Admittedly, fixed-amount loans are better for students who have unexpectedly high earnings so this system might discourage some risk-taking. But so does the current system for those who want to avoid the down-side unemployment and no long-term relief from student loans. A system of \"shares\" would likely also discourage investors from paying for worthless online degrees, or college amenities that do not advance future earnings. This is a relatively new concept for me, so I'm eager to hear from those who want to change my view, or at least help me refine my understanding of the trade-offs. Thanks for weighing in! Edit 1: Thanks for all the great comments and arguments so far. One delta awarded at this point to uPlexiglassPelican for suggesting it makes better sense to have the payment based on a percentage of income beyond a basic amount that would have come even without a degree. (ungxp has also convincingly argued that existing banks would not likely be the ones to enter this new format, but that doesn't persuade me the format is a bad idea. I think maybe formulaic, risk-averse banks should take a back seat in this arena.) Edit 2: Whoa! So many great comments and thoughts. Many here are presuming (as I admit I did when I first started the thread) that what major you choose would likely be a key factor for investors deciding who to fund. And so many people here are assuming that a share system would be the death of the liberal arts. Although no one has really argued to the contrary, I now think this is a misplaced emphasis. Although it is not central to my view, I'm inclined to think that getting a degree in any major at an ivy league school vs. any major at a local community college is going to be a bigger factor than your major choice within a given school. Also, the share system doesn't have to be a fixed percentage (though probably there is a natural maximum at the point it starts to discourage seeking work). Finally (and relatedly), getting a degree in something doesn't mean that you are compelled to work in that field. So getting an English degree from a second-rate university might wind up costing, say 12 of your earnings (above a certain threshold see edit 1) for the next 30 years, while getting a Math degree from Stanford might wind up costing 3 of your earnings. Edit 3: Thanks to all who participated in this spirited discussion. I'm going to wrap this up with a final delta to uhacksoncode who made clear to me that those who marry and have a spouse support them after college would need to be prepared to commit a portion of their joint income to repay the investor. Most of the rest of the comments at this point seem to be covering the same ground, which I have not found persuasive in my view that the proposed system is better than the student loan system: Investors would find this product more risky than loans, and so it would not fit the business model of banks Stupid people would no longer be able to, literally, mortgage their future to \"dream\" unrealistically Direct taxpayer funding of college might be better than either system. This deal would be better for some people than for others. For those who wind up making higher incomes, it would on average be a worse deal than existing student loans, for those who wind up making lower incomes it would on average be a better deal. Even if I agreed with these things, and mostly I do, they would not change my view.

{"original_text": "Rock and Roll music is no longer an important part of the cultural conversation. This is obviously not to say that there is no longer rock music being made, that that music is never popular, or that that contemporary rock music isn't good. But rock has become similar to jazz and classical - while there is still lots of it being made, it's not a powerful cultural force any more. The modern cultural conversation is being played out in hip-hop and EDM. Of the current Top 10 on the Billboard charts, the only rock single is \"Shut Up and Dance\" by Walk the Moon, at 9, and that song is heavily influenced by EDM. The current Song of the Summer is generally agreed to be Fetty Wap's \"Trap Queen.\" The most consistently popular rock band currently is probably either the Foo Fighters, a band that has been around since the late 90s and still plays a very similar style of music to what they were playing then (and arguably still owe a large portion of their popularity to nostalgia for Nirvana, a band whose largest cultural moment was 24 years ago), or the Black Keys, a band playing with a deliberately retro style. Tame Impala and Arcade Fire, two bands that have been lauded for their innovation in the rock genre have on their most recent albums embraced EDM influences, and largely moved away from guitar-based rock. I would argue that the most culturally important albums of the past few months have been outside of rock - Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp A Butterfly, Drake's If You're Reading This It's Too Late, Mark Ronson's Uptown Special, Taylor Swift's 1989 (in which she ditched her country roots for an embrace of EDM pop). There has been a lot of rock music recently that has been great too (Father John Misty, Courtney Barnett, Colleen Green, and Jim O'Rourke have all released albums I have absolutely loved, and I just listened to the new Titus Andronicus album yesterday) but that has become an exception, and as my examples point out, it's not really commercially popular or culturally relevant beyond a small core. I don't have a real problem with rock losing its cultural cachet. I love rap, RB, and electronica as well, and think that there is a lot of great innovation going on in modern music (and even that 2015 is an all-time stand-out year).

{"original_text": "I submit that Nye's public perception of'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before he was every famous. Beyond that, he's just been a guy on TV reading from a script. Even working at Boeing, his primary job was that of a TV persona: he made the training videos. I feel that Obama's use of Nye regarding global warming is strictly an appeal to the populace who grew up watching a kid show, not the opinion of a professional with a background in anything remotely related to climate. This doesn't mean I disagree with what he said, but only disagree with the idea that he should be trusted'as a scientist'. He's a PR tool in that regard. He only parrots others' research - in everything he's done -not anything he actually observed through his own research. Further, simply having a degree in a scientific background makes you aware of that background (he has a bachelor's in engineering from Cornell), but that doesn't make you a scientist in the field. I know many people with degrees in one field who work in an entirely different field. A law degree doesn't make you a lawyer, for instance. My father has one and he's a retired contractor: never worked a legal case in his life. Nye's background hardly applies to the vast majority of his TV demonstrations and appearances. And to the point of Carl Sagan, Neil Tyson, and others: these are actual scientists who have been published, who do (did) research in the field of their degree and beyond. Yes, these men are TV personas, but unlike Nye they're actually also scientists. So? Change my view. He's one of my childhood heroes too, but I simply can't accept him as a scientist. I feel that cheapens real work by real scientists. Edit: [Delta awarded] , albeit not in a way I had in mind. It's technically correct, [but we all know...] To many of the comments: - Education is important and admirable, but that still doesn't make you a scientist in my view. If that's the standard of calling oneself a scientist while being displayed on news media as an expert to be listened to, then really, there's no measure for what an expert is in that regard. - There are many qualified scientists who are also good on TV: I still assert Nye's appearances were heavily caused by his association as the funny lab-coat and bow-tie'science guy' and childhood memories, which is a manipulative and deceptive thing to do when appearing in support of public policy (regardless of my agreement and my own support of the same policy).

I concede this is a meaningful, scientific advancement for the public made by Bill Nye.", "text_perturb": "I submit that Nye 's public perception of'being a scientist ' exist largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history , he had one'scientific ' accolade : he developed a device for Boeing long time before he was every famous. Beyond that , he 's just been a guy on TV meter reading from a script. Even forge at Boeing , his primary job was that of a TV persona : he made the training videos. I feel that Obama 's use of Nye regarding global warming is strictly an appeal to the populace who grew up see a kid show , not the opinion of a professional with a background in anything remotely related to climate. This does n't intend I disagree with what he said , but only disagree with the idea that he should be trusted'as a scientist '. He 's a PR instrument in that regard. He only parrots others ' enquiry - in everything he 's done -not anything he actually observed through his own enquiry. Further , simply having a degree in a scientific background makes you aware of that background ( he has a bachelor 's in engineering from Cornell ) , but that cause n't make you a scientist in the field. I know many people with degrees in one field who work in an only different field. A law degree does n't puddle you a lawyer , for instance. My father sustain one and he 's a retired contractor : never worked a legal case in his life. Nye 's background hardly applies to the vast majority of his television set demonstrations and appearances. And to the point of Carl Sagan , Neil Tyson , and others : these are actual scientists who have exist published , who do ( did ) research in the field of their degree and beyond. Yes , these gentlemans gentleman are TV personas , but unlike Nye they 're actually also scientists. So ? change my view. He 's one of my childhood heroes too , but I simply ca n't go for him as a scientist. I feel that cheapens real work by real scientist. Edit : [ Delta awarded ] , albeit non in a way I had in mind. It 's technically correct , [ but we all love. . . ] To many of the comments : - Education is significant and admirable , but that still does n't make you a scientist in my view. If that 's the standard of calling oneself a scientist while being displayed on news media as an expert to be listened to , then really , there 's no beat for what an expert is in that regard. - There constitute many qualified scientists who constitute also good on TV : I still assert Nye 's appearances were heavily caused by his association as the funny lab-coat and bow-tie'science guy ' and childhood memories , which is a manipulative and deceptive thing to do when appearing in support of public policy ( regardless of my agreement and my own support of the same policy ). That deception equal not unintentional , but calculated. Herein lie down my problem and reasoning for this post. I should note that this still stands as my view , and the delta award was award basically because I worded the post in a particular way. If anyone would like to address this view , I 'd grant another delta if the mods are okay with it. - I really , honestly think that comparing Nye and people like Neil Tyson and Carl Sagan is an revilement to the latter two.

{"original_text": "Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, for example: 1. My child, my choice. Well, yes. And this is the closest one to a valid argument, IMO. But of course we put limits on what parents are allowed to do and choose for their children; you can't deprive your child of food or education (in the US) and be allowed to keep your child, so clearly it is NOT all your choice. While refusing vaccines is nowhere near on that level, not EVERY possible choice is equally acceptable, because your child is a person, not a piece of property. If the child had the capacity to refuse, I might be swayed, but unfortunately young babies can't understand vaccines on any reasonable level. And, more importantly, it IS still your choice under school vaccination schemes; you can choose to homeschool your child, or send them to private schools that don't care. Those choices aren't available to everyone and that's unfortunate (for far more important reasons than this), but...that's our current system anyway. Being rich gets you all kinds of benefits. I don't think this is different from being able to buy better medical care, better schools, better food, private tutors, and worlds more for your child if you have the resources (I do support basic income, which would alleviate this issue, but that's neither here nor there as we haven't got it). Public schools are a governmental service, and there are rules about who can and cannot use them. I think it is fine to say only vaccinated (or medically exempt) people can use them. 2. Not everyone can get vaccinated. That's why doctors are able to issue waivers for those not medically right for vaccination. This already happens and should continue. 3. Vaccines are dangerous. Not as dangerous as rampant infection. Honestly this is its own debate...But suffice it to say you are going to need some pretty major evidence to possibly CMV. I don't think it exists, but I won't rule it out. I don't really want to talk about vaccine efficacy as it has been done to death, but I guess if there's some truly amazing evidence... 4. Everyone is entitled to an education. They still are. Any unvaccinated child either needs to attend a non-public education option, be homeschooled or eschooled, provide a medical certificate that says they shouldn't be vaccinated, or get the shots. I don't necessarily have a strong view on the best way to handle noncompliance, and don't know enough about policy to say what would be most effective and just. Maybe fines for the parents? The same punishment as parents who refuse to send their kids to school or teach them at home for other reasons? I would not support removing the child from the home or incarcerating the parents, or any other severe punishment. What would change my view: evidence that such a policy would have clear public health risks, would unavoidably keep children from getting an education, or would have some other major negative effect on society. I also am open to the idea that it is fundamentally unjust, though it doesn't seem that way to me right now. Edit: My post focuses mainly on why I think mandatory vaccination isn't bad, but it occurred to me that it might be helpful to say why I think it's good. Mainly, I think it's good because it protects those who cannot be vaccinated and the minority of children for whom the vaccine was ineffective or wore off sooner than it \"should have\" based on medical guidelines. Children should be safe at school, and I think this promotes safety in a significant waysince children can die of preventable illness. Edit2: If vaccines are prohibitively expensive and can't be obtained for free, this system is pretty shit for poor families. In my area you can get free vaccines in certain conditions, which are very lenient. If this isn't true everywhere in the US (and it almost certainly isn't), it should be before vaccines are made mandatory. Edit3: Going to bed now, will respond to new posts tomorrow.

Now, what I do still stand by is that while you're entitled to edit your comment to say \"thank you\" or whatever you wish, you probably still shouldn't. Here is my new, primary argument: N1.) The reddit gold system is already designed to give you a chance to be thanked, but you knowingly reject this by choosing to send the gift anonymously. As a recipient of anonymous gold, editing your comment might express your appreciation to future readers, but the gilder will NOT be notified of your edit and they most likely will never see it. They rejected their chance to be thanked by checking the anonymous button and there is no remaining obligation on your part. With that, receiving gold feels great! I think our human nature calls for us to always have someone to thank (or blame) for the uncontrollable events in our life. It's a good thing to show your appreciation, but when it comes to reddit gold, there is no obligation to thank someone who has \"opted-out\" and editing your original comment does accomplish its intended effect. If you're just getting here, you can skip the rest of this post and go directly to the comments section. If you're interested in my original discussion (which includes edits at the bottom), I was just wanting to keep that available. [BEGIN ORIGINAL POST] I think it's wonderful that reddit allows you to edit your comments. Valid reasons to edit might be include adding additional information, clarifying certain points, or simply fixing typos. In an ideal world, reddit would show the revision history for edited comments (perhaps while performing a mouse-over on the asterisk? Hint, hint, reddit!). Since we don't have this feature, editing can sometimes lead to confusion or frustration. The ambiguity of the asterisk can mean critical parts of a comment were added or removed and perhaps the entire commentmessage was changed. It's slightly unsettling to not know how a post was modified, but when it's a gilded comment, that desire to see the original message is even stronger. To help organize things, here are my main objections to this practice: 1.) Once an edit has been made, there is no way to guarantee you're seeing the original message. This obviously applies to any post on reddit, but gilded posts especially are meant to catch the eye so this tends to give them a little more weight in a conversation. Since gilded posts attract more attention, I think preserving their original message is even more important. Adding \"thanks\" to a gilded comment isn't a good reason to invoke the edited flagasterisk. 2.) It detracts from the message. A witty one-liner is always made better with gold. Writing up a thank you message to the end adds bloat to an otherwise concise comment and arguably takes away from the humor as well. I've seen thank you messages longer that the original comment. Something about that just doesn't seem right... 3.) A conversation on reddit is typically comprised of a number of comments. Adding personal messages interrupts the overall flow. I often think of the various replies to a comment as contenders fighting for conversational focus. Whoever makes the best point gets upvoted to the top and that becomes the primary direction a conversation flows. The point here is that we read through comments and comment-replies as if they were one extended conversation. Adding personal messages to any one of the comments in the chain hinders the overall readability of the big-picture conversation. 4.) There is a better alternative. When giving gold, you're presented with the option to remain anonymous. Choosing to be anonymous means choosing to not be recognized. To edit your post is to go against the gilder's wishes. On the other hand, a person can deselect that option and then you'll be able to reply directly to them! In summary, there should never be a reason to edit your post for thank yous. The system is designed to give the gilder the option to receive recognition and it really should be their say, not yours. 5.) A \"thank you\" edit will most likely never reach the eyes of the gilder anyway, it only affects future readers. After giving gold, you most likely venture off elsewhere on reddit. There are no notifications that a gilded comment changed and in all likelihood you probably won't see that comment again. Sure, a person can always go back and look at the gildings they've given, but I doubt many people go out of their way to do this JUST to see if someone thanked them. As stated in point 4, the gilder already has a mechanism to receive thanks. If they chose to remain anonymous then go back to look for your \"thanks,\" it's a stupid game they're playing. There's no reason to cater to these people. Tl;dr: Editing posts can mean a number of things and creating that uncertainty just to say \"thanks\" is an improper use of the feature. I think the fact that the gold-giving system allows the gilder to select their anonymity puts the power in their hands. If someone chooses to be anonymous, they don't care about recognition and you should respect that. If they don't choose to be anoynmous, reddit provides you with a means to say thank you directly! No comment edits necessary! EDIT: Okay, so it's only fair I address the elephant in the room. Some funny-guy decided to gild this post. Part of me is tempted to strike-out everything above and shout \"THANKS FOR THE GOLD!\" but I gotta stick to my guns, lol. Thankfully, they did not choose to be anonymous so I was able to thank them properly:) In any case, being my first gold, I feel I should be open about my new perspective (which is the reason why I've edited this!). I hate to think I was just jealous and butt-hurt before (I think there's still more substance to the debate than that:-P), but damn it feels great and you really do want to praise whoever did it! The fact that the person giving the gold is able to dictate their anonymity still makes me believe it should be their call, though. EDIT 2: One final point I'd like to make is this: 6.) The purpose of reddit gold (outside of site sustainability), is not for any individual to be recognized, but for the comment itself to be recognized. This is why I'm so dead-set on preserving the original post. I think each viewer should be able to experience the same impact a comment had before it was gilded. It all boils down to the view that \"thank you\" messages are non-value-added fluff. I agree it's a nice gesture, but as I've already covered, that is clearly not something the gilder is worried about if they choose anonymity. I'm sure some people are rolling their eyes at me editing this post, but to me \"valid edits\" are all about adding value. Maybe someone can earn a quick delta by showing me how all \"value\" is subjective to the individual anyway: To some, perhaps a \"thank you\" is value added. I can't argue that!
