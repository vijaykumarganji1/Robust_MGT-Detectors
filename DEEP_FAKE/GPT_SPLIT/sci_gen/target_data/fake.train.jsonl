To solve DDAEs , different numeral methods have been developed , such as the method of steps , the collocation method , and the generalized differentiation method. Additionally , sensitivity analytic thinking can be performed on DDAEs to understand the effect of parameters on system behavior. This can help in optimizing the organization 's performance or designing controllers to regulate the organization. Overall , DDAEs provide a useful framework for modeling and analyzing systems with time-delays , and advancements in numerical methods and sensitivity analysis have made them more accessible for hardheaded applications.

{"original_text": "This paper proposes an adaptive human pilot model that is able to mimic the crossover model in the presence of uncertainties. The proposed structure is based on the model reference adaptive control (MRAC) framework, which allows the pilot model to adapt to changes in the aircraft dynamics and disturbances that can affect the pilot's performance. The crossover model is a well-established human pilot model used in aerospace applications, which represents the pilot's behavior as a combination of inner-loop and outer-loop control actions. The inner-loop control is responsible for stabilizing the aircraft around the desired trajectory, while the outer-loop control adjusts the trajectory to achieve the mission objectives. The proposed pilot model consists of two parts: the first part is a fixed structure that contains the inner-loop control actions, and the second part is an adaptive structure that contains the outer-loop control actions. The fixed structure is designed based on the crossover model, and its parameters are tuned using experimental data. The adaptive structure comprises an adaptive controller that uses the MRAC algorithm to adjust its parameters based on the aircraft's behavior. The MRAC algorithm works by comparing the output of the adaptive controller with the output of a reference model, which represents the desired behavior of the system. The difference between the two outputs is used to calculate the error signal, which is used to update the adaptive controller's parameters. The update process continues until the adaptive controller's output matches the reference model's output. In this way, the model adapts to changes in the system's dynamics, which can improve its performance in the presence of uncertainties. The proposed pilot model is tested using a simulation-based case study, where it is compared with the crossover model and a baseline model. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline model and is comparable to the crossover model in terms of tracking accuracy and control effort. Moreover, the proposed model's adaptation capabilities are demonstrated by introducing disturbances to the aircraft's dynamics, where it shows improved performance compared to the crossover model.

{"original_text": "Over the last 30 years, researchers have investigated connections between dimension for posets and planarity for graphs. Here we extend this line of research to the structural graph theory parameter known as treewidth. Treewidth is a measure of how \"tree-like\" or \"branching\" a graph is, and captures the idea that many graphs of practical interest have a hierarchical structure. More formally, the treewidth of a graph G is the minimum width over all tree decompositions of G, where the width of a tree decomposition is the maximum size of a bag (subset of vertices) in the decomposition. One way to think about treewidth is that it measures how easy it is to decompose a graph into smaller \"tree-like\" components.

{"original_text": "Batch Normalization (BN) is capable of accelerating the training of deep models by centering and scaling activations within mini-batches. In this work, we propose Decorrelated Batch Normalization (DBN), which not only normalizes the activations, but also reduces their correlation, leading to improved generalization performance. DBN achieves this by introducing an additional transformation to the BN operation, which decorrelates the feature channels. This transformation is based on the Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD) of the channel covariance matrix, and it is applied separately to each channel in a mini-batch. The benefits of decorrelating the feature channels are twofold: 1. It reduces the redundancy of the features, making them more informative and improving the overall representation power of the model. 2. It makes the optimization landscape smoother, reducing the sensitivity of the network to the choice of hyperparameters. Experimental results on various benchmarks show that DBN can improve the performance of state-of-the-art deep models, including ResNet, WideResNet, and MobileNet, while keeping the same computational cost as BN.

The basic idea here is to construct a sequence of tables, where each table represents the optimal solution for a subset of items.

At each step, we consider all possible bins that the current item can be packed into. For each bin, we compute the cost of packing the item into that bin using the best solution found so far for the remaining items. Finally, we take the minimum over all possible bins to obtain the optimal solution. The time complexity of this algorithm is O (nm2), which can be quite high for large problem instances.

In this network, multiple RISs are spatially distributed to serve wireless users, and each RIS can adjust the phase shift of the reflected signals to improve the signal quality and coverage. The goal of this paper is to optimize the allocation of wireless resources, including transmit power, subcarrier allocation, and RIS phase shift, to maximize the system capacity subject to the constraints of user quality of service (QoS) requirements, power budget, and RIS hardware limitations. The proposed approach in this paper leverages a joint optimization framework that incorporates the user-RIS and RIS-RIS interference constraints, which are modelled as convex quadratic constraints. A three-step algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem by first obtaining the optimum subcarrier allocation, followed by an iterative RIS phase shift optimization, and finally the transmit power allocation.

{"original_text": "We propose a machine learning framework to synthesize reactive controllers for systems whose interactions with their adversarial environment are modeled by infinite-duration, two-player games over (potentially) infinite graphs. Our framework uses a combination of reinforcement learning and formal methods to learn policies that guarantee the system's safety and performance objectives. The system's model and specifications are encoded in the form of a game graph, and the learner interacts with the environment to improve its policy over time. Our approach starts with a reachability game, where the objective is to reach a desirable state or avoid an undesirable state. The learner uses reinforcement learning to generate candidate policies, which are then checked for their satisfaction of the safety and performance constraints specified in the game structure. If the policy is unsatisfactory, the learner modifies it using a guided search approach, such as counterexample-guided abstraction refinement. Once a satisfactory reachability policy is learned, the framework can generalize it to a larger class of games by using model checking and synthesis techniques.

Our framework uses a combination of reinforcement learning and formal method to learn policies that guarantee the system 's safety and performance objectives. The system 's model and specifications are encoded in the form of a biz graph , and the learner interacts with the environment to improve its policy over time. Our approach starts with a reachability game , where the objective live to reach a desirable state or avoid an undesirable state. The learner uses reinforcement learning to generate candidate policies , which are then suss out for their satisfaction of the safety and performance constraints specified in the game structure. If the insurance policy is unsatisfactory , the learner modifies it using a guided search approach , such as counterexample-guided abstraction refinement. Once a satisfactory reachability policy is learned , the model can generalize it to a larger class of games by using model checking and synthesis techniques. This allows the learner to synthesize a insurance that satisfies the system 's objectives in a wide range of environments. overall , our framework provides a powerful tool for synthesizing robust controllers for infinite-duration , two-player games over infinite graphs.

More specifically, we consider a setting where agents have heterogeneous values for the same chore, and we want to allocate the chore in a way that maximizes the minimum weighted payoff for each agent. This involves assigning different weights to each agent's valuation of the chore and taking the minimum of the weighted payoffs. One approach to achieve WMMS fairness in chore allocation is to use market-based mechanisms. In these mechanisms, agents bid on the chore and the chore is allocated to the bidder with the highest bid. However, to achieve WMMS fairness, we need to modify the usual bidding mechanism to take into account the weights assigned to each agent's valuation. One way to do this is to use a weighted Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, where the payment each agent is charged is proportional to the change in the minimum weighted payoff caused by their presence in the allocation. Another approach is to use algorithmic mechanisms, such as the random priority rule, to generate a random allocation of the chore that is proportional to the weights assigned to each agent's valuation.

A pseudoinverse is a generalization of a matrix inverse, which has been shown to be useful in solving linear systems when the matrix is not invertible. In the case of a sparse feature matrix, computing the pseudoinverse can be challenging, as the matrix may be very large and have many zero entries. One way to efficiently compute the pseudoinverse of a sparse feature matrix is to use iterative methods that leverage the sparsity of the matrix.

{"original_text": "We present a channel spectral estimator for OFDM signals containing pilot carriers, assuming a known delay spread or a bound on this parameter. The estimator is based on modeling the channel as a sparse tapped delay line and using compressed sensing techniques to recover the sparse tap coefficients of the channel. Specifically, we use a dictionary-based approach where a set of basis vectors is constructed, and the channel is modeled as a linear combination of these basis vectors. The pilot subcarriers are used to estimate the channel response at a few discrete frequencies. These estimates are used to construct a sparse vector that represents the channel taps. The entire channel spectrum is then estimated based on this sparse vector using the basis vectors in the dictionary. The main advantage of this approach is that it requires fewer pilot subcarriers than traditional methods, which results in higher data rates. Additionally, it is more robust to the presence of noise, since the sparsity assumption ensures that the estimation error is concentrated on a small number of taps.

{"original_text": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models usually use large target vocabulary sizes to capture most of the words in the target language. The vocabulary size is a big factor when decoding sentences during the translation process. As a result, larger vocabulary sizes can lead to longer decoding times and higher memory usage. To optimize the performance of NMT models, researchers have developed different methods to reduce the vocabulary size while maintaining translation quality. Some of these methods include: 1. Subword Segmentation: This method segments words into smaller subword units, allowing the model to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and rare words more efficiently. 2. Word Pruning: This approach removes infrequent words from the vocabulary, reducing the vocabulary size. 3. Dynamic Vocabulary: This method limits the vocabulary size during decoding based on the most frequent words encountered in the source sentence. 4.

State-of-the-art approaches for accurate visual localization use scene-specific representations, resulting in a high computational cost and limited generalization to new scenes. However, recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the development of more efficient and generalizable methods for visual localization. These methods use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn a mapping from images to poses. This mapping can be applied to new images to estimate their poses, without the need for scene-specific representations or feature engineering. One popular technique for visual localization using CNNs is to train a regression network to directly estimate the camera pose from an input image. This is typically done using a dataset of image-pose pairs, where the poses are acquired using external sensors, such as GPS or LiDAR. The network learns to predict the camera pose by minimizing the difference between the predicted pose and the ground truth pose. Another approach is to use a CNN-based feature descriptor to match keypoints between images. The feature descriptor is trained to encode local image patches into a low-dimensional vector that is robust to changes in lighting, viewpoint, and occlusions.

One possible outcome of increased data efficiency in machine learning is that it could lead to more job displacement, as machines become capable of performing tasks that were once only possible for humans. This could have a significant impact on employment opportunities and the workforce, as people would need to adapt to new roles and industries. On the other hand, increased data efficiency may also lead to the creation of new jobs as businesses and industries expand their use of machine learning technologies.

This approach is especially effective when the pre-trained model is similar to the new dataset in terms of domains and styles.

{"original_text": "In a sponsored search auction, decisions about how to rank ads impose tradeoffs between objectives such as revenue and welfare. In this paper, we examine how these tradeoffs should be made in the context of a multi-sided search market. Specifically, we consider a market consisting of advertisers and consumers, where advertisers bid for ad space and consumers search for information using a search engine. The objective of the search engine is to maximize social welfare, which is the sum of the utility derived by both consumers and advertisers. To achieve this objective, the search engine needs to balance the revenue generated by ads with the relevance of the ads to consumers. This can be achieved through various ranking algorithms and mechanisms. One such mechanism is the use of quality scores, which take into account factors such as relevance, landing page quality, and user experience. Furthermore, the search engine can also consider the diversity of ads displayed to consumers.

Let V (G) denote the vertex set of G and N[v] denote the closed neighborhood of v in G. Consider any vertex v in G. Since C has a distinct intersection with N[v], there are two possibilities: either v is in C, or there exists a vertex u in C such that u is adjacent to v. Case 1: v is in C. Since v is in C, it follows that every vertex in N[v] is also in C. Hence, the size of C is at least N[v]. Since this holds for every v in G, we have C sum{v in G} N[v] 3. Case 2: There exists a vertex u in C such that u is adjacent to v. Since u is adjacent to v, it follows that every vertex in N[u] is also in C. Hence, we can replace u with v in C and obtain a new identifying code C' such that every vertex in N[v] is also in C'. Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that every vertex u in C has a non-adjacent vertex in C. Consider any vertex v in G. Let Cv {u in C: u is not adjacent to v}.

Since every edge in the subgraph induced by N[v] is incident to at most 2 vertices in N[v], we have Cv E (N[v 2. Let E (G) denote the set of edges in G. Counting the edges incident to all vertices in G, we have: sum{v in G} E (N[v 2E (G) . Therefore, sum{v in G} Cv sum{v in G} E (N[v 2 E (G) V (G) - 1. Since C sum{v in G} Cv C inter V (G) , and every vertex in C has a non-adjacent vertex in C, we have: sum{v in G} Cv 2C 3.

{"original_text": "Search is a central problem in artificial intelligence, and BFS and DFS the two most fundamental ways to search. In this report we derive results for average BFS and DFS search times on random graphs. We consider undirected graphs with n vertices and m edges, where each edge is chosen independently with probability p. We assume that the graph is connected, meaning that every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. We first consider BFS. Starting at a given vertex s, BFS visits all vertices in increasing order of distance from s. The algorithm maintains a queue of vertices to visit next, initially containing only s. At each step, it removes the first vertex from the queue, adds all its neighbors that have not yet been visited to the end of the queue, and marks it as visited. We model BFS as follows. For each vertex v, we associate a random variable Xv that is the distance from s to v in the graph. We assume that Xs 0 and that Xv is infinite if v is not reachable from s. Our goal is to compute the expected value E[Xv] for each v. To compute E[Xv], we use the \"one step\" property of BFS. Let u be a vertex at distance i from s that has just been removed from the queue, and let v be a neighbor of u that has not yet been visited. Then we have E[Xv Xu i] i 1p This is because the distance from s to v is one more than the distance from s to u, and there is a 1p probability that the edge (u,v) exists. Using this property, we can compute E[Xv] recursively. Let V1, V2, ..., Vk be the neighbors of v that have smaller distance than v in the BFS ordering. Then we have E[Xv] 1 1p (E[XV1] E[XV2] ... E[XVk This is because the first step of BFS from s visits all neighbors of s, so the contribution of the neighbors to the expected distance of v is given by the formula above. We can solve this recursion using dynamic programming. We first sort the neighbors of each vertex by increasing distance in the BFS ordering. Then we compute E[Xv] in increasing order of distance from s. For each vertex, we compute E[Xv] using the formula above, taking the values of E[XV1], E[XV2], ..., E[XVk] that have already been computed. The running time is O (n log n m), dominated by the time to sort the neighbor lists. Next, we consider DFS. Starting at a given vertex s, DFS visits all vertices reachable from s in depth-first order, meaning that it explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking to explore other branches. The algorithm maintains a stack of vertices to visit next, initially containing only s. At each step, it removes the last vertex from the stack, adds all its unexplored neighbors to the end of the stack, and explores the first such neighbor. We model DFS as follows. For each vertex v, we associate a random variable Yv that is the number of steps taken by DFS to explore v, starting from s. We assume that Ys 0 and that Yv is infinite if v is not reachable from s. Our goal is to compute the expected value E[Yv] for each v. To compute E[Yv], we use the \"two step\" property of DFS. Let u be the parent of v in the DFS tree, and let w be a neighbor of v that is not its parent.

{"original_text": "We introduce a new regularizer in the total variation family that promotes reconstructions with a given Lipschitz constant (which can also vary spatially). We prove regularizing properties of this functional and show that it indeed enforces the desired Lipschitz constraint on the reconstructed signal. The proposed regularizer is particularly useful in applications where the reconstructed signal needs to be smooth but cannot have sharp edges or oscillations, such as in medical image reconstruction. The regularizer is defined as follows: mathcal{R} (u) int{Omega} abla u (x) ho (x) dx where u is the reconstructed signal, abla u is its gradient, Omega is the reconstruction domain, and ho (x) is a spatially varying weight function that enforces the Lipschitz constraint. The Lipschitz constant at a point x is defined as: L (x) sup{h1} rac{ abla u (x) cdot hh} where cdot denotes the Euclidean norm.

This can make them less suitable for applications that require high error tolerance, such as quantum communication or fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TE jobs are computationally intensive and time-consuming, as they require performing multiple iterations of the full training of deep neural networks. To efficiently schedule TE jobs in a computing cluster, a few approaches can be employed. One possible approach is to use a dynamic scheduling algorithm that prioritizes the jobs with the lowest remaining processing time in the queue. This approach ensures that the TE jobs that are closer to completion are scheduled first, thus reducing the waiting time for the researchers. Additionally, using preemption strategies can help to maximize the cluster utilization by interrupting low priority jobs and allocating the resources to TE jobs when available. Another approach is to use meta-learning techniques to learn from the outcomes of the previous TE jobs and adaptively adjust the scheduling priorities based on the historical performance.

{"original_text": "Inference on a large-scale knowledge graph (KG) is of great importance for KG applications like question answering. The path-based reasoning models can leverage much information over paths other than pure node features, which makes them effective for KG inference. However, as the size of the KG increases, the computational cost of reasoning over all possible paths in the KG also increases exponentially, which makes path-based reasoning models impractical for large-scale KGs. To address this challenge, several approaches have been proposed, such as sampling-based methods that only consider a subset of the paths or pruning-based methods that selectively remove less relevant paths.

These conditions provide a way to check the state observability and controllability of time-varying nonlinear system. The authors present a few examples to demonstrate the applicability of the extended rank and file conditions for nonlinear systems. The results obtained from the examples picture that the extended rank conditions are useful in designing control strategies for time-varying nonlinear systems. In summary , the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of mastery systems by extending the observability and controllability rank conditions to time-varying nonlinear systems. This leave enable researchers and practitioners to have a better understanding of the observability and controllability properties of such systems , leading to the development of more effective control strategies.

The attention maps are computed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes the current frame as input. The resulting maps highlight the regions of the image that are most relevant for object localization. Second, we use a temporal attention mechanism to track object regions across frames. This is done by computing a dense correspondence field between consecutive frames and using it to propagate the attention maps from one frame to the next. This allows us to maintain consistent object localization across frames, even in cases where the object moves or undergoes significant deformation.

{"original_text": "We study the problem of distributed coverage control in a network of mobile agents arranged on a line. The goal is to design distributed dynamics for the agents to achieve uniform coverage of the line with a prescribed density. This problem has applications in autonomous vehicle platooning, robotic surveillance, and environmental monitoring. To address this problem, we can use a consensus-based approach where the agents adjust their positions using information from their neighboring agents. The dynamics can be designed such that each agent moves towards the average position of its neighbors while avoiding collisions.

The motion information is then utilized by computing the optical flow between consecutive frames over each appearance group. This results in a set of motion models that capture the common patterns of motion within each appearance group. Once the AGMFs are extracted, they are fed into a deep autoencoder neural network that is trained in an unsupervised manner to reconstruct the input AGMF sequence. The autoencoder network is then used to compute reconstruction errors, which are used to determine the likelihood of a given sequence of AGMFs being anomalous or normal. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on two challenging video datasets.

We use the concept of Bayesian Nash equilibrium to analyze the proposed game-theoretic framework , where each factor selects its action based on its private information and the beliefs it holds about the other agents ' private information. Our framework 's main advantage is that it enables decentralized decision-making in multi-agent system of rules while maintaining a global objective , ensuring task allocation efficiency , and incentivizing agents to accomplish tasks with minimal costs. Furthermore , our framework is scalable and adaptable to changing environmental conditions , making it suitable for various practical applications such as golem task allocation and resource allocation in wireless networks. Overall , our proposed approach has the potential to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-agent systems in performing complex tasks , making it a valuable addition to the field of multi-agent systems and game possibility.

{"original_text": "Recent advances in Fourier analysis have brought new tools to efficiently represent and learn set functions. In this paper, we bring the power of Fourier analysis to the design of machine learning algorithms for set data. We propose a novel approach that exploits the Fourier transform of set functions to learn representations that capture the inherent structure of sets. Our approach uses a neural network architecture that learns a mapping from the original set to a compressed representation space that preserves the relevant information about the set. The key idea is to use the Fourier transform of the set function to convert it into a vector of Fourier coefficients. These coefficients capture the frequency content of the set function and provide a compact representation that encodes the structure of the set. We then use a neural network to learn a mapping from these Fourier coefficients to a lower-dimensional representation space. Our approach has several advantages over existing methods for learning representations of set data. First, it is a principled approach that leverages the powerful machinery of Fourier analysis. This allows us to capture complex structures in sets, such as correlations and dependencies between elements, that are difficult to model with other methods. Second, our approach is computationally efficient, as the Fourier transform can be efficiently computed using fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms. This makes our method practical for large-scale datasets, which are common in many applications. Finally, our approach is flexible and can be applied to a wide range of tasks involving sets, such as classification, clustering, and regression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms existing methods for learning representations of set data.

{"original_text": "The introduction of LTE over unlicensed bands (LTE-U) will enable LTE base stations (BSs) to boost their capacity and offload their traffic by exploiting the underused unlicensed bands. However, to ensure fair coexistence with other wireless technologies sharing these bands, the LTE-U system needs to implement listen-before-talk (LBT) protocols to avoid interfering with other systems. This is a significant challenge for LTE-U, since the timing and duration of LTE-U transmissions must be carefully coordinated to avoid collisions with other systems sharing the same band. To address this challenge, LTE-U systems use a carrier sensing mechanism to detect the presence of other wireless signals before transmitting. If the channel is occupied, the LTE-U BS waits until the channel becomes available before transmitting.
