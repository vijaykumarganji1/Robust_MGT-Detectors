{"original_text": "This paper presents a tool for addressing a key component in many algorithms for planning robot trajectories under uncertainty: evaluation of the safety of a robot whose actions are governed by a control policy. The tool is called SafeMotion, and it uses a combination of numerical optimization and simulation-based methods to analyze the safety of a robot motion over a specified time horizon. SafeMotion takes as input a control policy and a set of initial states, and it outputs a safety metric that reflects the probability of the robot colliding with obstacles or going beyond specified physical limits during the execution of the motion. One of the interesting features of SafeMotion is its ability to handle non-deterministic behaviors and uncertain environments. SafeMotion can evaluate the safety of a motion under different scenarios where the robot encounters different configurations of obstacles or disturbances. This allows SafeMotion users to gain a more complete understanding of the safety of a control policy under different conditions and to determine the worst-case scenarios that must be avoided.

{"original_text": "In this paper we study the problem of designing a distributed graph visualization algorithm for large graphs. The algorithm must be simple to implement and the computing infrastructure must not be a limiting factor. With this in mind, we propose a decentralized approach that can efficiently handle graphs with millions or even billions of nodesedges. The algorithm works by dividing the graph into a number of partitions, each of which is assigned to a particular processor. Initially, each processor is only aware of its own partition and the connections between nodes in that partition. As the algorithm progresses, processors exchange information about their respective partitions and build a global representation of the graph. To visualize the graph, each processor independently calculates the position of nodes within its partition. We use a force-directed layout algorithm that simulates physical forces between nodes to determine their positions. The positions are then combined to create a global layout of the entire graph. To improve the efficiency of the algorithm, we use several optimization techniques. For example, we use a spatial index to reduce the number of pairwise force calculations between nodes. We also employ caching to avoid unnecessary computation when nodes remain static. Our experimental results show that our algorithm scales well with increasing graph size and number of processors.

The scheme is designed using the flux-vector splitting (FVS) approach, which separates the numerical flux into two components: a wave-propagation flux and a hydrostatic flux. The wave-propagation flux handles the advection of fluid properties such as temperature, density, and momentum, while the hydrostatic flux represents the vertical variation of pressure due to gravity. To ensure stability and accuracy of the scheme, we derive a set of thermodynamic consistency conditions that satisfy the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy, as well as the second law of thermodynamics. These conditions enforce a balance between the wave-propagation and hydrostatic fluxes, and ensure that the numerical solution does not violate any physical laws. The scheme is implemented using a second-order Godunov method with piecewise parabolic reconstruction (PPM) in space and a third-order TVD Runge-Kutta method in time. We test the scheme on a number of benchmark problems, including the rotating shallow water equations with and without temperaturedensity gradients, the geostrophic adjustment problem, and the baroclinic instability problem.

In this paper we propose a novel efficient learning scheme that can handle such large datasets. Our approach is based on the use of deep learning techniques, specifically a deep neural network architecture called a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a training strategy called stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with mini-batch updates. The CNN framework is particularly suited to handling high-dimensional data, such as images, and has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks. The key idea behind CNNs is to leverage the local and spatial correlation of image pixels by using convolutional filters that extract meaningful features across the image. SGD is an optimization algorithm commonly used for training deep neural networks. It works by iteratively adjusting the weights of the network in the direction of the negative gradient of a loss function, with the aim of minimizing the loss. As the name suggests, SGD updates the weights in a stochastic manner by sampling a subset of the data (called a mini-batch) for each iteration, which reduces the computational cost and enables efficient processing of large-scale datasets. Our proposed learning scheme combines the power of CNNs and SGD with mini-batch updates to efficiently learn from large-scale datasets in a scalable and effective manner.

Next, we remove the fence by inpainting the regions that are occluded by the fence with pixels from the surrounding background.

Following recent work in simplifying and compressing neural networks, one approach to reducing the size of RNNs is through the use of techniques such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. Pruning involves removing weights, connections, or entire neurons from the network that have very low values or do not significantly contribute to its overall performance. This can significantly reduce the number of parameters and improve the efficiency of the network. Quantization involves representing the weights and activations of the network with lower precision, for example, by using 16-bit or 8-bit integers instead of the standard 32-bit floating point values. This reduces the amount of memory needed to store the network parameters and can speed up the computations. Knowledge distillation involves training a smaller, more compact model to mimic the behavior of a larger, more accurate model.

{"original_text": "Transient execution attacks, also called speculative execution attacks, have drawn much interest as they exploit the transient execution of instructions, e.g., during branch prediction, to leak data. Transient execution is a feature of modern processors that allows them to execute instructions speculatively ahead of time to improve performance. In a typical processor pipeline, instructions are fetched, decoded, executed, and then the results are written back to memory or a register file. However, with transient execution, instructions are fetched and executed speculatively, even before the processor has finished decoding instructions earlier in the pipeline. In the case of branch prediction, which is used to predict the outcome of a conditional jump instruction, the processor will speculatively execute the instructions in the predicted path, even if they might not be needed. This allows the processor to execute instructions faster by reducing the number of pipeline stalls caused by waiting for the outcome of a branch instruction. However, this speculative execution can potentially reveal sensitive data, particularly if the instructions being executed are accessing data that the attacker is interested in. For example, an attacker may be able to leak secrets such as encryption keys or other sensitive data by carefully crafting instructions that are executed speculatively, and then observing the effect of those instructions on the processor's cache.

SIC is a technique where users decode the strongest sign first , remove it from the received sign , and then decode the next strongest sign. This process continues until all signals have exist decoded. Overall , this network simulation allows for efficient use of resources and high spectral efficiency due to the use of NOMA and SIC techniques. ", "label": 0}
{"original_text": "Most state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches only achieve high accuracy in good conditions. In practically-common but less-discussed adverse environmental conditions, their performance can decrease enormously. Existing studies usually cast the handling of adverse environmental conditions as a problem of domain adaptation, transfer learning, or adapting the model to the specific challenge. However, there is much ongoing research in developing methods that can generate more robust and accurate semantic segmentation under a variety of challenging environmental conditions. Some of the techniques include incorporating self-supervision, adversarial training, multi-modal learning, and data augmentation. These techniques can help expose the model to different data distributions in training, which in turn can make the model more robust to different environmental conditions. Another important approach is to use real-world data augmentation techniques by creating synthetic data that mimics real-world conditions. By doing this, the model can learn to handle the challenges it may face in the real world. Overall, precise semantic segmentation in changing and adverse environmental conditions remains a challenge.

{"original_text": "Multi-target multi-camera tracking (MTMCT) systems track targets across cameras. Due to the continuity of target trajectories, tracking systems usually restrict their data association within a local neighborhood. In single camera tracking, data association is typically based on the appearance or motion model of the targets. However, MTMCT systems face additional challenges, such as occlusion and camera view changes, which can cause significant shifts in appearance and motion. To overcome these challenges, researchers have developed various techniques for MTMCT, including tracklet-based association, graph-based association, and deep learning-based methods. Tracklet-based association uses short-term trajectory segments, called tracklets, to associate targets across cameras. Graph-based association constructs a global graph, where nodes represent targets and edges represent spatial and temporal relationships between them.
