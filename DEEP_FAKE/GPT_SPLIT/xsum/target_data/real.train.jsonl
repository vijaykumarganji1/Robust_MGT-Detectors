{"original_text": "Seven people have denied conspiracy to defraud at Cardiff Crown Court after six insurance claims worth PS144,000 were made between 2009 and 2011. Matthew Davies, 33, of Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, said he suffered injuries in a \"genuine\" crash. A guitar worth PS1,850 was also damaged, he said. On Monday, the court heard Mr Davies, who runs a valeting business, expressed his disapproval of personal injury claims during an interview about his own. \"It's not something I agree with,\" he said at the time. \"I understand the reflection that personal injuries and claims have on the price of people's insurance policies.\" The prosecution said he was also recorded as having stated everyone else \"is doing it, so I'm going to put one (a claim) in.\" Mr Davies told the court he and fellow defendant, Adam Fear, 27, also of Pontypridd, played together in a band called Heroes and Outlaws. They went for a jam session at a home on Shelley Walk in Rhydyfelin, Pontypridd, on 15 October 2010, Mr Davies said. He told the court the pair were later driving out of the area when Mr Fear's car collided with a BMW at the junction of Dyffryn Road and Cardiff Road. When asked whether he was telling the truth and the crash was genuine he said: \"Yes, it was.\" The court heard Mr Davies attended his GP a week later. \"Initially, I was fine but on the Sunday and Monday evening I could not sleep very well. I had numbness in my fingers and ringing in my ears,\" he said. He also told medics he was suffering with neck and back pain after the alleged accident. Mr Davies visited Caerphilly Miners' Hospital on 3 November 2010, having consulted with a firm of injury specialist lawyers. When quizzed by prosecutor Christopher Clee, Mr Davies said he had \"no idea\" why details about his injuries and the accident appeared to differ in the various medical notes. Mr Davies told the court he discovered his Gibson Les Paul Custom electric guitar was damaged only when collecting it from the wrecked vehicle after the crash. He said it only later occurred to him that he might make an insurance claim on it but, as he had failed to find a receipt, he ended up having to \"cut his losses\" and accept an offer of PS300 for the damaged instrument. His fellow band mate Mr Fear has already told the court he is innocent of conspiracy to defraud.

He was caught after approaching MI5 officers, who were posing as a fellow extremist, via social media. Syed was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years and six months. Last year, his brother was jailed for life for plotting to behead someone on Remembrance Sunday. Judge Michael Topolski QC said Syed wanted to carry out \"an act of mass murder\" and therefore a discretionary life sentence was warranted. Prosecutors say Syed's plans ranged from becoming a suicide bomber to staging a gun attack, and while he initially boasted of working with others, those people did not materialise. Instead, over the summer of last year, he made increasingly urgent efforts to secure weaponry. After he went online looking for help, a purported jihadist fighting overseas, known only as Abu Isa, introduced him to another extremist going by the name Abu Yusuf.

Teen admits planning'London bomb attack' Duncan Penny QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey there was initially some \"suspicion on both sides\" before Abu Yusuf concluded that Syed was a \"committed brother\" he could deal with. Syed then began talking about his aspirations and gave his contact a shopping list, saying he wanted \"do martyrdom\" after first causing \"damage\" with a machine gun. \"Can you get the gear?\" asked Syed. \"You will be involved right? \"Two things. Number one, machine gun and we need someone who can make a vest you know the dugma [button] one.

Syed floated the idea of going to fight overseas with his new-found friend - but revealed his passport had been cancelled by the authorities. He tried and failed twice to get fraudulent loans of thousands of pounds to cover the cost of firearms - and eventually agreed to meet his contact in a coffee shop in Slough, Berkshire, to finalise an alternative plan. Over two meetings, he talked about his aspirations and then handed over PS150, asking for a bomb packed with nails. The conversation was secretly recorded. \"I was thinking of Oxford Street,\" he told his contact. \"If you put those things inside called nails, do you know what that is, nails?

{"original_text": "Media playback is not supported on this device Since dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights, skittling well-meaning people frantically waving warning flags, and only slowing down to shout obscenities and honk his horn, the louder the better. But that can happen when your mind is scrambled and you don't know what's what: you might be in the driver's seat but your hands aren't on the wheel, your feet are up on the dashboard and there's a brick on the accelerator pedal. Another way of looking at it is that Fury's crash actually came on that fateful night in Germany and he has been spewing smoke ever since. The morning after the Englishman's stunning upset of Klitschko and his acquisition of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, he admitted he might struggle to cope. But not even those closest to him could have anticipated how true that would prove. Having beaten the various boxing authorities to the punch and relinquished the belts before being banned, stripped or both, it's anyone's guess as to when - if ever - he'll have his keys back and his engine revving again. Fury has been speaking about his mental health struggles for years, with disarming and often alarming frankness. So his pronouncement immediately after his victory over Klitschko and the recent news that he was withdrawing from the scheduled rematch because of depression was not a shock. When I interviewed him in 2013, he described himself as \"an all-action man in anything I do. If I'm drinking, I'm drinking until I can't stand up. If I'm going out for Chinese, I'm going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese. If I'm eating cake, I'm eating the whole cake. I don't know what you'd call me. An idiot, maybe?\" Hardly surprising, then, that having fulfilled his dream of winning the world heavyweight crown, Fury would lose focus. Most people having fallen down drunk or eaten a whole cake would steer clear of booze and Battenbergs for a while. But Fury is not most people. Fury is not the first boxer to lose motivation having reached the pinnacle of the sport, and he certainly won't be the last. Not many people climb Everest twice. The repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional After pulling off one of the greatest shocks in sporting history by beating the seemingly invincible Mike Tyson in 1990, Buster Douglas didn't train much, got fat and lost the world heavyweight crown to Evander Holyfield in his first defence. The American promptly retired, almost doubled in weight, then nearly died after falling into a diabetic coma before being struck down by depression. Same old, same old. Jess Willard's victory over the great Jack Johnson in 1915 was almost as unbelievable as Douglas's upset of Tyson, and his reign even more shameful. Willard clearly didn't fancy fighting much, defending the world heavyweight crown once in four years before being bashed up by the great Jack Dempsey. Sometimes depression can be triggered by a lack of motivation for the thing that defines you, sometimes that lack of motivation is triggered by depression. Either way, Fury claims he hasn't been near a gym for months and has been drinking like a fish and hoovering up cocaine instead, in a forlorn bid to mask the pain. Media playback is not supported on this device In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine this month, Fury accused the British media of conducting a \"witch hunt\" against him and the British public of racism. It is important to separate the different links in Fury's sometimes rambling trains of thought. Before and after his victory over Klitschko, sports writers openly discussed whether Fury should be saved from himself. Different journalists operate under different editorial guidelines, but the view of most was that they had been sent to Germany to report on a fight, not Fury's controversial outbursts. As such, the repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional. Almost every boxing writer proclaimed Fury's performance as one of the finest ever by a British fighter, and they were right. But the problem with a siege mentality is that you forget what's happening beyond the castle walls, who your real friends are, and paranoia sets in. When Fury threatened violence against a journalist and later took aim at bisexual, transsexual and Jewish people, it was internet vloggers - to whom he had granted intimate access - who provided the platform. The so-called mainstream media (newspapers and major broadcasters) had been frozen out, ironically because they had dared to report what he had told those same vloggers. Fury's camp would do well to memorise a quote attributed to George Orwell: \"Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printing. Everything else is public relations.\" How many times has Fury been saved by journalistic self-censorship? In threatening that journalist, the Mail on Sunday's Oliver Holt, for reporting that he had compared homosexuality to paedophilia, Fury betrayed his sense of entitlement - not only because of his feats in the ring, but because of his religious convictions. If it's in the Bible, how dare anyone question his beliefs? If you make questionable statements about gay people or Jews or women, the media will come down on you, whether you are a fine boxer, a deeply religious man, a nice bloke really, none of the above or all of them. Fury's Traveller heritage doesn't come into it, as least as far as most of the media is concerned. \"I know Tyson personally and he's a really nice guy,\" says Ricky Hatton, Fury's fellow Mancunian and another boxer who has struggled with depression. \"But sometimes he puts his mouth into gear before his brain and when someone puts a camera in front of him he feels he has to say something outrageous.\" Fury fans frequently claim that Anthony Joshua is given preferential treatment by the media, but this is because the IBF heavyweight champion - Fury was stripped of that belt shortly after winning it because he would not face the federation's mandatory challenger - largely conducts himself like a gentleman. As for Joshua's brushes with the law, they have been covered at length in the media and he has clearly learnt from them. However, some of the racial abuse Fury receives on social media is despicable. When you are called every name under the sun on a daily basis, it is likely to have an effect on your mental wellbeing. No wonder, as Fury also stated in his interview with Rolling Stone, that he feels like everyone is out to get him. On Wednesday, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) met to discuss what should be done with Fury, and has suspended his licence, pending a meeting with him. It could hardly do otherwise. It did the same to Hatton in 2010, also following allegations of cocaine use, and, as the BBBofC's general secretary Robert Smith has pointed out, \"cocaine is against the law of the land.\" There was also Fury's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and a subsequent ban to consider (Fury has an appeal hearing scheduled in November), as well as the allegation that he refused to take a drugs test (a misdemeanour that can lead to a four-year ban) and the argument that a man with severe mental health issues shouldn't be anywhere near a boxing ring. It should also be remembered that the BBBofC has already fined Fury twice for misconduct and that it has boxing's image to think about - as mad as that sounds. Even if Fury hadn't voluntarily given up his belts, the WBA and WBO would have stripped him of them. It might seem callous, but the sanctioning bodies are businesses, the heavyweight belts are their biggest money-spinners and it is only fair that other boxers should be allowed to fight for them. It makes no difference whether a boxer has meningitis, a broken leg or mental health issues, the sport must move on. As WBO chief Jose Izquierdo put it: \"We can't have a belt held hostage.\" One can only hope that, during his absence from the ring, Fury gets the help he so desperately needs and returns fitter and more focused. \"Being someone who lives by the seat of his pants and for the moment, this could be the end of him,\" was Hatton's grim assessment. \"He doesn't like boxing and finds the training hard. It's not looking good. \"But I was in a dark place, didn't care if I lived or died. I did very well in boxing but near enough everything wrong in life. The only way I got out of it was by asking for help. I fought through it and I hope Tyson can do the same.\" Fingers crossed that Fury will be remembered for that fine performance against Klitschko in Dusseldorf - and for many fine performances in the future - rather than as a wreck, spewing smoke on the side of the road as bright lights flash by.", "text_perturb": "Media playback is not supported on this device Since dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November , the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights , skittle well-meaning people frantically waving warning flags , and only slowing down to shout obscenities and honk his horn , the louder the better.

{"original_text": "Wasps goalkeeper Neil Parry had already denied Dobbie three times before the striker curled in a drive off a post. Parry saved again from Dobbie after the break, but the 33-year-old would not be denied his fifth goal in three Challenge Cup outings and 12th goal of the season for the Championship side. His close-range header killed off the lively League One visitors' hopes. And it ended a run of eight games without a victory for the Dumfries side - a sequence that had ended with Gavin Skelton standing down as manager earlier this week. The side under caretaker Jim Thomson, who had been football development manager, for the first time became the second into the last four. Dundee United had earlier beaten Dunfermline Athletic 1-0 at East End Park. League One leaders Livingston host Welsh champions The New Saints, while Ayr United visit Championship rivals St Mirren, in two Sunday quarter-finals. A Grant Anderson header had grazed the Alloa crossbar before Dobbie made the breakthrough at Palmerston Park. The Wasps had their moments, with Jamie Longworth being denied by goalkeeper Lee Robinson and Greig Spence going close with an overhead kick with Jim Goodwin's part-time side only one goal behind and looking the more likely to score.

It has been years since her party won here in Germany's most populous state. Sunday's vote in North Rhine-Westphalia is the last ahead of the general election in September. And it is viewed as a bellwether. This is Social Democrat country. The centre-left SPD currently rules in coalition with the Greens but polls suggest that could be about to change. In recent weeks Mrs Merkel's centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) have been closing in and support for the SPD has dwindled. The rivals are now neck-and-neck in the polls. It is not often that a German regional election is considered so important. Martin Schulz, the charismatic SPD leader, has thrown down the gauntlet. If his party wins here, he declared recently, he will be the next German chancellor. It is a statement he may live to regret. When Mr Schulz, ex-president of the European Parliament, returned to domestic politics there was an immediate surge of support in the polls for his party. The CDU looked on nervously as commentators noted for the first time in years that Mrs Merkel was no longer unchallenged in her bid for a fourth term in the chancellery. But since then the Social Democrats have suffered two humiliating electoral defeats at the hands of Mrs Merkel's conservatives, in regional votes in Saarland and, last Sunday, in Schleswig-Holstein. The party has slipped in the national polls and, even here in the SPD heartland, the so called Schulz effect appears to have dwindled. \"His approval ratings will only stabilise once he says very clearly what he wants to do,\" says Brilon's SPD mayor, Christoph Bartsch. \"In the eyes of the voters that hasn't happened yet. We need a clear programme and clear policies on topics which matter to the electorate.\" Here the issues that matter include internal security and the economy. On security, the CDU's candidate for North Rhine-Westphalia has promised to make the state the envy of other German regions. There is a powerful industrial lobby here. On the edge of town, under a chimney smoking into the clouds, huge lorries deliver logs to the sawmill.

Mr Ansorge will not discuss his preferred choice of party or candidate, and Germany as a whole has four months left to make up its mind. In Brilon's market square, among the flower stalls and vans selling fish rolls, one enterprising pub was advertising \"Schnitzel Angela Merkel\" in honour of the chancellor's visit to the town. Few of the diners seemed tempted, and the cost of EUR19.54 (PS16.50, 21) - presumably chosen to reflect Mrs Merkel's birth year - was perhaps a little steep. \"I think she really will be chancellor again,\" said one stallholder. \"She's very self-assured, reliable and calm. And she's a woman - I like that.\" An elderly man nearby wasn't convinced. \"She promised too much and invited too many people without asking us. She wasn't thinking properly and too many bad people came to the country.\" Later, the rally finished, Angela Merkel posed for pictures with the band. She laughed as she refused to take the baton from the conductor. But make no mistake, this woman wants German voters to continue dancing to her tune.

{"original_text": "The new bill, which would affect digital maps from Google, Apple, and Uber, is facing stiff opposition from campaign groups. It also bans \"wrong\" information, including disputed international borders. The government said the rules would not create barriers to business if the bill became law. The bill bans all types of geospatial information, maps, raw data or photographs, acquired by any means, including satellite photography. Offenders could be fined up to 1bn rupees (PS10.4m). It also requires anyone who has already gathered such information to apply for a licence to keep it. It was designed to regulate both the creation and distribution of geospatial information in India \"which is likely to affect the security, sovereignty and integrity\" of the country, the Ministry of Home Affairs said. Critics say the definition of geospatial data is so wide it could include printed maps, world atlases, or depictions of the country in international magazines imported to India. The proposed law is likely to cause problems for Apple and Google's map products, as well as services offering \"value added\" geolocation services, such as taxi-hailing app Uber. It is also unclear if companies such as Google would have to go through a separate vetting process every time they updated their satellite imagery - a process that takes up to three months. There is an exemption for government agencies and departments.

Mr Trump said in a press release: \"Governor Haley has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country. \"She is also a proven dealmaker, and we look to be making plenty of deals. She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage.\" The Republican-controlled Senate will need to confirm her appointment before she officially takes office. In a statement, Mrs Haley said she was \"moved\" to accept the assignment and would remain the South Carolina governor, pending her congressional confirmation. She had endorsed Florida Senator Marco Rubio during the Republican primaries, later throwing her support behind Senator Ted Cruz - Mr Trump's final rival before he became the party's nominee. Although Mrs Haley eventually voted for Mr Trump, the governor said she was \"not a fan\" of either him or the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. Eye-catching though her political career has been, little is known about Nikki Haley's views on the foreign affairs and the United Nations. Diplomats here have been Googling her to find out more. When her nomination was announced I was with a senior diplomat, who had expected President-elect Trump to downgrade the job of UN ambassador so that it was no longer a cabinet-level position. He was heartened that Mr Trump had selected a \"political heavyweight,\" and viewed it as an early indication than the incoming administration will take the UN more seriously than he'd supposed. Certainly, she's no John Bolton, the US ambassador during the Bush administration who famously remarked that it would not make much of a difference if the UN headquarters in New York lost its top 10 floors - where the organisation's most senior figures, including the secretary general, have their offices. Many UN diplomats fear a Trump presidency and there's relief here that he hasn't appointed an outspoken UN-basher. She also sharply attacked Mr Trump's proposal to ban Muslim immigrants, calling it \"un-American,\" as well as his refusal to release his tax records. For his part, Mr Trump had called her \"very weak on illegal immigration\" and said South Carolinians were \"embarrassed\" by her. But the newly minted president-elect, who will be inaugurated in January, invited her for a meeting last week at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Mrs Haley has little previous foreign policy experience, though the Charleston Post and Courier reports she has taken at least eight trips abroad since becoming governor in 2011, mostly in support of economic development deals for her state. During a trade mission to Europe in 2011, she was criticised by the newspaper for staying at expensive hotels and attending parties, costing the taxpayer 127,000 (PS103,000). Born Nimrata \"Nikki\" Randhawa, Mrs Haley was raised in a Sikh household and now identifies as a Christian. She is the first minority and female governor of South Carolina, a deeply conservative state with a long history of racial strife. She was praised by members of both parties in 2015 when she ordered the Confederate battle flag to be removed from the grounds of the state capitol after a racially motivated shooting at an African-American church in Charleston.

{"original_text": "Instead of fees rising to PS9,250 per year in the autumn, Jeremy Corbyn is proposing a complete handbrake turn in saying that university tuition should not cost students anything. It's a bolder step than Labour's previous leader, who two years ago opted for a halfway house of cutting fees to PS6,000 - and then was accused of pleasing no-one. This is Labour going for an all-or-nothing approach - asserting free education as a fundamental principle - and creating the starkest choice in university policy for two decades. It's a direct appeal to younger voters - with surveys suggesting that students are more likely to vote Labour. It makes the pitch that no-one should be deterred from university because of the cost or fear of debt. Labour has costed the removal of fees - and the reintroduction of maintenance grants - as being worth PS11.2bn per year. And this is only England - because education funding is a devolved matter. There are no fees for Scottish students in Scotland and the Institute for Fiscal Studies says scrapping the lower fees charged in Northern Ireland and Wales would cost a further PS500m per year. This would be covered by the PS48.6bn that Labour's manifesto says will be raised by tax changes - along with the party's other spending commitments. But there are lower estimates. Labour's figure is based on replacing the fees currently paid by students. But the IFS and London Economics say the cost to the Treasury could be lower, when written off loans are taken into account, with forecasts around PS7.5bn to PS8bn. Labour's big move on fees represents a complete of direction. Previously in government, Labour raised fees and in opposition proposed a modest reduction. But they are now proposing to bulldoze the apparatus of fees, loans and repayments. The most recent figures show PS76bn is owed in student loans in England - with this level of student debt having almost doubled in four years. From this autumn, fees will begin increasing every year with inflation and will soon glide past the PS10,000 mark, with interest charges also rising to 6.1. And the Conservative government, before the election, had announced plans to sell off student debt to private investors. Under Labour's plans, this whole push towards marketisation would be ditched - and universities would return to being directly funded by government. But is there any evidence that getting rid of fees would help more young people into university, including the disadvantaged? Universities are worried that such a switch to direct funding, dependent on government finances, would put a limit on places and a brake on expansion. One of the quiet revolutions of recent years has been the complete removal of limits on student numbers - with universities able to recruit as many students as they can accommodate - and opening the door to rising numbers of graduates. The argument for fees has always been that they provide the funding to allow more young people to go to university - and that a much smaller proportion went to university when there were no fees. This year has seen a fall of 5 in university applications from UK students - and it follows a pattern of dips when fees are increased. But the long-term trend has been relentlessly upwards, with a huge growth in demand for university places. It remains a powerful symbol of family aspiration. Although wealthy families remain much more likely to send their children to university - entry rates have risen across all social classes, including the poorest. Do students get value for money from tuition fees? Is this an investment that is repaid in better job prospects? Department for Education figures published last month showed that graduates remained more likely to be in a job than non-graduates and on average earned PS10,000 per year more. Among younger people, this graduate advantage is less, at PS6,000 per year. But the figures also showed that, despite rises in fees, graduate salaries have stagnated over the past decade. Labour's plan sends a strong political signal to young voters. A survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute, taken before the manifesto publication, suggested that Labour is now more popular among students than it was in any of the three previous general elections. The survey found Labour significantly ahead in the student vote. The Liberal Democrats, once the most popular party for students, are trailing in third behind the Conservatives. Is this still the cloud of tuition fees hanging over the Lib Dems from their U-turn during the coalition government? Could they really entirely scrap fees? There will be plenty of scrutiny over funding Labour's plans. But there is nothing unprecedented or outlandish about getting rid of fees. Germany has phased out tuition fees - and universities in the Netherlands and Scandinavia try to recruit students from England with the offer of low or no fees. French undergraduates can study for low fees. In the United States, New York state is introducing free fees for students from families earning up to about PS100,000 per year, offering a handout to the squeezed middle classes. There are now leading universities in the US which have lower tuition fees than in England. The University of Washington charges less than the University of Wolverhampton.

This week she was given a ban and had earlier results annulled after a sample from 2009 was re-tested - but kept her world title. \"She set a personal best with the benefit of drug use,\" Minichiello said. Russian anti-doping agency punished Chernova with a two-year ban, backdated to 22 June 2013. It also annulled her results from 15 August 2009 to 14 August 2011 - a period that ended just 16 days before she won world gold in Daegu with a personal best of 6,880 points, beating defending champion Ennis-Hill's 6,751. Research carried out by the University of Oslo in October 2013 established that muscles can retain the advantages given by anabolic steroids decades after the point at which they were taken. Minichiello wants athletics' world governing body the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) to have a \"long, hard look\" at the Russian anti-doping agency's punishment. The IAAF told BBC Sport it is awaiting a full explanation from the Russian authorities before deciding whether it needs to take any action. \"Maybe it highlights that there is a gap within the anti-doping code which allows only a two-year ban from the initial test and then another ban from the date of the re-test,\" added Minichiello. \"I think it should probably all run seamlessly and athletes should be banned for the whole time. Otherwise you have a ban for Chernova that really looks quite ineffective.\" Chernova's backdated ban is due to expire on 21 June, and with the qualification period for the 2015 World Championships in Beijing running until 10 August, she could compete both there and at the 2016 Rio Olympics. \"It would be frustrating if she lines up on the starting line but those are the rules out there and we need to abide by them,\" said Minichiello. \"That is why we think Wada needs to look at its code and penalties to show there is potentially a loophole that needs to be looked. I'm sure the Russian anti-doping agency have administered suspensions according to the rules, so therefore it needs to be looked at.\" Last week, Russia's athletics head coach Valentin Maslakov resigned after a number of athletes from the country were found guilty of committing doping offences.

This week she was given a ban and had earlier results annulled after a sample from 2009 was re-tested - but kept her man title. `` She set a personal best with the welfare of drug use , '' Minichiello said. Russian anti-doping agency punished Chernova with a two year ban , backdated to 22 June 2013. It also annulled her results from 15 August 2009 to 14 August 2011 - a period that ended just 16 days before she won world gold in Daegu with a personal best of 6,880 points , beating fight down champion Ennis-Hill 's 6,751. Research carried out by the university of Oslo in October 2013 established that muscles can retain the advantages given by anabolic steroids decades after the point at which they were taken. Minichiello require athletics ' world governing body the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency ( Wada ) to have a `` long , hard look '' at the Russian anti-doping agency 's punishment. The IAAF told BBC Sport it is awaiting a good explanation from the Russian authorities before deciding whether it needs to take any action. `` Maybe it spotlight that there is a gap within the anti-doping code which allows only a two-year ban from the initial test and then another ban from the date of the re-test , '' added Minichiello. `` I think it should probably all run seamlessly and athletes should be ostracize for the whole time. Otherwise you have a forbidding for Chernova that really looks quite ineffective. `` Chernova 's backdated ban is due to expire on 21 June , and with the qualification period for the 2015 World Championships in beijing running until 10 August , she could compete both there and at the 2016 Rio Olympics. `` It would be torment if she lines up on the starting line but those are the rules out there and we need to abide by them , '' said Minichiello. `` That is why we think Wada needs to look at its code and penalties to show there is potentially a loophole that needs to cost looked. I 'm sure the Russian anti-doping agency have administrate suspensions according to the rules , so therefore it needs to be looked at. `` Last week , Russia 's athletics head coach Valentin Maslakov resigned after a number of athletes from the country were found guilty of send doping offences.

{"original_text": "As part of the deal, the firm was meant to have built a saw line by Friday. Despite questioning by AMs, Emyr Roberts did not give a clear answer as to whether that has happened. He said the deal - an effort to deal with diseased larch - was a success. Although he was happy with the decision, Mr Roberts admitted that its documentation was \"not good,\" that there should have been more discussion with Welsh Government and that the executive board could have had a greater role in scrutinising the deal. A member of the committee, Lee Waters, later dubbed the answers \"unconvincing.\" In 2014 a company was awarded a PS39m deal to purchased both spruce and larch timber - the latter of which was forests where a fungus disease causing extensive damage - Phytophthora ramorum - was present. No other company was given the opportunity to bid for the contracts. As part of that deal the company was meant to have built a new saw line by 31 March 2016. That deadline was missed and extended by 12 months to March 2017. During a session of the assembly's Public Accounts Committee, Labour Llanelli AM Lee Waters asked Mr Roberts if the line had been built. \"We are in on going discussions with the operator on that,\" said Mr Roberts. Mr Waters pressed him again, pointing out that the date of the committee's meeting was 28 March. Mr Roberts repeated the answer, adding later it was a \"commercial matter.\" Mr Waters asked if Mr Roberts felt the firm \"pulled the wool over your eyes in making you feel that the only way they were going to deal with this crisis was by investing in new expensive capital equipment.\" Mr Roberts replied with a denial: \"No, I don't think they have pulled the wool over our eyes at all.\" \"At the time, there was no market for larch,\" he said, claiming timber merchants at the time \"would not touch larch, let alone diseased larch.\" \"What the operator did and the rest of the industry did was actually build up that market.\" Mr Roberts said there was a \"real crisis on our hands at the time\" and there had been a danger the timber market would collapse. \"The situation today was a lot more stable than it was in 2013-14. Our policy, our decisions on these contracts together with the overarching policy in treating larch disease has been successful,\" he said. \"It's stopped the spread, but it's meant the timber market has been able to carry on as well.\" A report by auditor general Huw Vaughan Thomas released earlier in March expressed doubt over whether the decision met state aid rules and said the decision-making process was not transparent.

Ministers said they were committed to removing the barriers faced by women. The difference between men and women's median hourly earnings for full-time work in Scotland fell from 7.7 in 2015 to 6.2 in 2016. Studies show fewer women work in higher-paid sectors like technology, IT and engineering, and continue to be under-represented in senior management and leadership roles. Despite 51 of workers in finance and insurance being female, it is the sector with the highest pay gap, at 29.9. The committee cited UK government figures as showing that \"equalising women's productivity could add almost PS600bn to the economy\" across the country. Convener Gordon Lindhurst said much had changed in the labour market since the 1970 legislation. The Conservative MSP told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the inquiry aimed to be \"open-minded\" about how closing the gap could affect the economy. He said: \"The committee wants to hear from businesses and individuals who may be affected by this issue and we want to take their views and experiences on board, and look at how we can weave that into policy recommendations for the Scottish government. \"We want to encourage companies to look at the issue in perhaps a more positive way than sometimes is thought, and to see how this can be of benefit not just to the employees but also to the companies themselves. \"The committee is open-minded about this.

{"original_text": "The Council for Science and Technology (CST) wants \"public good\" GM varieties to be grown and tested in the UK. It says GM crops should be assessed individually - like pharmaceuticals - taking potential benefits into account. A new UK regulator similar to NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) should be set up, it says. The UK is a world leader in plant biotechnology research, but GM field trial applications have fallen from 37 in 1995 to just one in 2012. By David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News The controversy over genetically modifying plants is riddled with contradictions. Take the European Union. Its internal politics have caused a logjam in approvals but the EU science budget is also funding some of Britain's research. Europe grows very few GM plants but most of its imported animal feed is genetically modified. It was America's agricultural giants whose hard sell of GM put off so many European consumers but it is also US science that provides the evidence, gathered over the past two decades, that supports the assurance that GM plants and food are safe. And while Britain's leading plant scientists appeal to the prime minister to help foster this new technology, its leading supermarket chains avoid stocking GM products because no-one is asking for them. So can anything shift? The key is whether ministers can change minds in Brussels - and that's no easy task given the hostility towards GM in big players like France and Germany. A long haul lies ahead. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has spoken in favour of increasing UK research into GM, which he said offers the \"most wonderful opportunities to improve human health.\" The CST was asked by Prime Minister David Cameron for the latest evidence on the risks and benefits of GM technologies in agriculture, and for advice on UK and EU regulation. In turn, it commissioned a group of leading plant scientists from Rothamsted Research, The Sainsbury Laboratory and Cambridge University to make recommendations to the prime minister. The scientists say they are being held back by strict EU regulations - based on the principle that GM crops are inherently more dangerous than conventionally-bred varieties. Only two GM varieties have been licensed for commercial harvest in Europe - despite the fact that 12 of the world's arable land is cultivating GM crops. The CST report argues GM crops have now been shown to be safe - and may be necessary in future for Britain to grow its own food supply, rather than depending on imports. It says the UK should regulate commercial GM varieties of wheat and potatoes based on their individual benefits and risks - rather than follow the EU's blanket approach. It also recommends a new programme of publicly-funded field trials to test \"public good\" GM crop varieties, which it calls \"PubGM.\" \"Public good\" traits could include nutritional enhancement, such as antioxidants in tomatoes, or vitamin A in \"Golden Rice.\" They could also include \"climate-proofing\" properties such as drought resistance or heat resistance. \"With PubGM, seed companies, consumers and regulators will be able to decide, based on results of experiments, whether a GM trait has proved its worth in UK crops under UK conditions,\" said Professor Jonathan Jones from The Sainsbury Laboratory, one of the report's authors. Sir Mark Walport, chief scientific adviser and CST co-chair, said: \"We take it for granted that because our shelves in supermarkets are heaving with food there are no problems in food security. But there are. \"We're part of a global food market. Competition is likely to increase. The world is already malnourished and the population is growing. \"The challenge is to get more yield from the same area. GM is not a magic bullet, but it is one of a range of technologies that we should consider.\" The report was welcomed by Dr Julian Little, chair of the Agricultural Biotechnology Council (ABC), which represents companies including BASF, Monsanto and Syngenta. \"Current EU regulation has moved in the direction of increasing political influence and undermining science. \"Europe risks being left behind and it therefore remains essential that action is taken to address the dysfunctional EU approvals process so that UK farmers may, in the future, be able to realise the potential of great British biotechnology research right here in the UK.\" But the environmental group Friends of the Earth say GM will not make food more affordable or sustainable. \"GM crops have been hugely over-hyped. Despite decades of research they have failed to deliver the benefits they have promised - and have been an expensive distraction from real solutions to the challenges we face,\" said senior food campaigner Vicki Hird. \"Our food production system needs a radical overhaul to ensure everyone has access to healthy, affordable food that doesn't wreck the planet - but putting more power into the hands of multi-nationals is not the answer.\" Prof Cathie Martin, of the John Innes Centre, one of the creators of GM purple tomatoes, said changing regulations would help scientists make progress with GM varieties that benefit society. She told BBC News: \"It takes 10 years to get European regulators to approve a new GM trial, and costs in the order of 150m.

Almost 40 of those who said they were harassed at work did not report the situation, fearing it would damage their careers. \"I was propositioned by a hiring manager early in my career when I was a job candidate,\" one contributor to the study wrote. \"He clearly indicated that if I slept with him, he would make sure I was promoted as his'second in command' as he moved up the ladder in the company.\" Another said she had turned down her CEO's sexual advances the first time they travelled together for work. \"After that, I was never asked to travel with him again,\" she said. \"This impacted my ability to do my job.\" The study followed a high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit in 2015 from former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao - one of those praising Ms Fowler's stand against Uber.

{"original_text": "Research shows Europeans are a mixture of three major ancestral populations - indigenous hunters, Middle Eastern farmers and a population that arrived from the east in the Bronze Age. DNA from ancient remains in the Caucasus has now revealed a fourth population that fed into the mix. Details are published in Nature Communications. Scientific advances in recent years have allowed researchers to retrieve and analyse genomes from ancient burials. The genome is the genetic blueprint for a human, contained within the nucleus of every cell. This deluge of data has transformed our understanding of the modern human genetic landscape. It has also shown that present-day genetic patterns are poor guides to ancient ones. The first layer of European ancestry, the indigenous hunter-gatherers, entered Europe before the Ice Age 40,000 years ago. But 7,000 years ago, they were swept up in a migration of people from the Middle East, who introduced farming to Europe. About 5,000 years ago, herders called the Yamnaya entered Europe from the eastern Steppe region - in present day Ukraine and Russia. These horse riding metal workers may have brought Indo-European languages with them; today this language family comprises most of the tongues spoken in Europe. The discovery of plague DNA in Yamnaya burials and a population decline in Europe around the same time has led some researchers to wonder if their passage west was facilitated by the spread of disease. The Yamnaya transformed the gene pools of northern and central Europe, such that some populations, like Norwegians, owe around 50 of their ancestry to these Steppe pastoralists. But the Yamnaya were themselves a mixed population. Around half of their ancestry came from a sister group to the hunter-gatherers who inhabited Europe before farming, while the other half appears to be from a population related to - but noticeably different from - the Middle Eastern migrants who introduced farming. Researchers have now analysed genomes from two hunter-gatherers from Georgia that are 13,300 and 9,700 years old. The results show that these Caucasus hunters were probably the source of the farmer-like DNA in the Yamnaya. The Caucasus hunter-gatherer genomes show a continued mixture with their Middle Eastern cousins to the south, who would go on to invent farming 10,000 years ago. However, this mixing ended about 25,000 years ago - just before the time of the last glacial maximum, or peak of the Ice Age. At this point, populations shrank - as shown by their genes homogenising, a sign of breeding between those with increasingly similar DNA. Once the ice retreated, the Caucasus groups came into contact with a different group of hunter-gatherers living on the Steppe and mixed with them, laying the genetic foundations of the Yamnaya people. \"The question of where the Yamnaya come from has been something of a mystery up to now,\" said co-author Dr Andrea Manica, from the University of Cambridge. \"We can now answer that as we've found that their genetic make-up is a mix of Eastern European hunter-gatherers and a population from this pocket of Caucasus hunter-gatherers who weathered much of the last Ice Age in apparent isolation.\" The researchers also suggest that the Caucasus hunter-gatherers influenced populations further east, particularly in South Asia. They suggest that this strand of ancestry may also have been associated with the spread of Indo-European languages to the region.", "text_perturb": "Research shows Europeans are a mixture of three major ancestral populations - indigenous hunters , Middle Eastern farmers and a population that go far from the east in the Bronze Age.

The genome exist the genetic blueprint for a human , contained within the nucleus of every cell. This deluge of data has transformed our savvy of the modern human genetic landscape. It hold also shown that present-day genetic patterns are poor guides to ancient ones.

{"original_text": "Intense negotiations are under way between political parties amid public anger at a one-off levy of up to 10 being imposed on savers. President Nicos Anastasiades said refusing the bailout would have led to the collapse of the country's banks. The speaker of the European Parliament has called for the levy to be revised to protect small-scale bank customers. The 10bn-euro (13bn; PS8.6bn) deal agreed by the EU and IMF in Brussels marks a radical departure from previous international aid packages. Under its terms, people in Cyprus with less than 100,000 euros in their accounts would have to pay a one-time tax of 6.75. Those with sums over that threshold would pay 9.9 in tax. Depositors will be compensated with the equivalent amount in shares in their banks. It is believed that eurozone leaders, particularly in Germany, insisted on the levy because of the large amount of Russian capital kept in Cypriot banks, amid fears of money-laundering. QA: Cyprus bailout UK to help troops President Anastasiades, who was elected only last month, is due to address the country shortly (from 18:00 GMT). He said in a statement earlier that Cyprus had had to choose between the \"catastrophic scenario of disorderly bankruptcy or the scenario of a painful but controlled management of the crisis.\" The president has been meeting with members of the parliament's finance committee, his office said. On Saturday the head of the committee, Nicholas Papadopoulos, expressed shock at the deal, saying it was \"much worse than expected.\" The president's Democratic Rally party - which has 20 seats in the 56-member assembly - needs support from other factions to ratify the bailout. A spokesman for one of its coalition partners, the Democratic Party, told BBC News they wanted assurances that the deal would resolve the problems facing Cyprus before voting in favour. Opposition leader George Lillikas, an independent, said the president had \"betrayed the people's vote.\" The speaker of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, argued in a newspaper interview that there should be an exemption from the levy for savers, for example, who had less than 25,000 euros in their accounts. By Gavin HewittEurope editor \"The solution must be socially acceptable,\" Mr Schulz, who belongs to Germany's opposition Social Democrats, told Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, defended the levy. \"With this deal, the responsible people are partly included in those countries and not only the taxpayers in other countries,\" she said at a party meeting in her home constituency. \"And I think it's right that we went down that road and I think it's a good step which will certainly make it easier for us to approve the help for Cyprus.\" As with past eurozone bailouts, the deal must be approved by the lower house of parliament in Germany, the EU's biggest economy. If the levy goes ahead, it will affect many non-Cypriots with bank accounts, including UK expatriates. However, depositors in the overseas arms of Cypriot banks will not be hit. Bank of Cyprus UK and Laiki Bank UK both confirmed on their websites that there would be no impact. Chancellor George Osborne said the UK would compensate any government employees and military personnel whose bank accounts were affected.

He said in a statement earlier that Cyprus had had to choose between the `` catastrophic scenario of disorderly bankruptcy or the scenario of a painful but controlled direction of the crisis. `` The united states president has been meeting with members of the parliament 's finance committee , his office said. On Saturday the head of the committee , nicholas Papadopoulos , expressed shock at the deal , saying it was `` much worse than expected. `` The president 's Democratic Rally party - which has 20 seats in the 56-member assembly - needs support from early factions to ratify the bailout. A spokesman for one of its coalition partners , the Democratic Party , told BBC News they wanted assurances that the deal would resolve the problems facing republic of cyprus before voting in favour. Opposition leader George Lillikas , an independent , said the president had `` betrayed the people 's right to vote. `` The speaker of the European Parliament , Martin Schulz , argued in a newspaper interview that there should be an exemption from the levy for savers , for example , who make less than 25,000 euros in their accounts. By Gavin HewittEurope editor `` The solution must be socially acceptable , '' Mr Schulz , who belongs to Germany 's resistance Social Democrats , told Germany 's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. The German Chancellor , Angela Merkel , defended the levy. `` With this deal , the responsible mass are partly included in those countries and not only the taxpayers in other countries , '' she said at a party meeting in her home constituency. `` And I think it 's right that we went down that road and I think it 's a good footmark which will certainly make it easier for us to approve the help for Cyprus. `` As with past eurozone bailouts , the deal must represent approved by the lower house of parliament in Germany , the EU 's biggest economy. If the levy goes ahead , it will affect many non-Cypriots with bank accounts , admit UK expatriates. However , depositor in the overseas arms of Cypriot banks will not be hit. Bank of Cyprus britain and Laiki Bank britain both confirmed on their websites that there would be no impact. Chancellor George Osborne said the UK would compensate any government employees and military personnel whose bank accounts be affected. The levy itself will not take effect until tues , following a public holiday , but action is being taken to control electronic money transfers over the weekend. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "The England skipper hit a run-a-ball 92 at Headingley, with James Taylor and Ben Stokes both scoring 41. David Willey had earlier reduced Australia to 30-3 with the new ball before they recovered to post 299-7. Glenn Maxwell, who was dropped on 6 and 35, top-scored with 85 off 64 balls. The Australia all-rounder also took two stunning catches but his efforts were not enough to prevent England overhauling a score of 300 or more for only the fourth time in their one-day international history. Their previous best ODI run-chase against Australia was 270-4 at Lord's in 1997. It was England's second successive victory, after they also won at Old Trafford on Tuesday, and means the hosts can still send Australia home defeated across all formats after they won the Ashes 3-2 and the solitary Twenty20 international by five runs. Morgan anchored England's run-chase perfectly with his eighth score of 50 or more in his last nine innings. Jason Roy and Taylor had shared a first-wicket partnership of 72 off 53 balls but England's progress stalled when both were dismissed in quick succession. Morgan, however, slowly rebuilt the innings as he took 40 balls to score his first 20 runs before slowly accelerating. He hit John Hastings for a straight six which landed on the roof of the adjacent rugby stadium as he thumped eight fours and two maximums before being caught at backward point by Maxwell's stunning one-handed catch. Although Morgan appeared disappointed not to have finished the job, his brilliant innings took England to 238-5 with more than 10 overs remaining. Some big hitting from Liam Plunkett and Willey, plus a steady hand from Moeen Ali, saw England home with 10 balls to spare. Morgan is the highest scorer in the series but only just ahead of Taylor, who followed up his century at Old Trafford with a counter-attacking 41 off 42 balls. He hit eight boundaries in his innings - compared to just five in his career-best 101 in Manchester earlier this week - and displayed a different side to his game before chasing a ball down the leg side and being acrobatically caught by Matthew Wade. Taking on the fast bowlers, he was particularly strong through the off side as he cut and drove impressively to seize the early initiative back from Australia following the early loss of Alex Hales for a two-ball duck. Former England captain Michael Vaughan believes Taylor has now done enough to justify selection on the tour of the UAE to play Pakistan next month. \"I think they've got to take him,\" said Vaughan. \"Taylor plays spin differently to many England players, using his feet well. \"He hasn't faced brilliant spin in this series, but he's played it in a good fashion, and he's looked good against the quick bowlers. He's read situations well, and that's what he'd have to do at five in Test cricket.\" Willey, who will play for Yorkshire next season after deciding to leave Northants this summer, was superb with the new ball in the absence of the injured Chris Woakes and the rested Steven Finn. The left-armer started by swinging the white ball into the right-handers' pads - dismissing Joe Burns (played on) and Steve Smith (lbw) cheaply - before occasionally running it across the batsmen. That created doubt in the minds of Australia's batsmen and Aaron Finch was the next to go when he edged behind to Jonny Bairstow. Willey and Moeen were the pick of the England bowlers, with Australia failing to score a run off 50 of the latter's deliveries. However, the hosts' familiar problems at the back end of an innings resurfaced, with Australia smashing 77 off the last six overs. Both Willey and his fellow opening bowler Mark Wood bowled too full, allowing Wade and Hastings to get under the ball and plunder enough boundaries to take Australia from 215-7 in the 42nd over to 299-7 when their innings closed. It was not just Willey who impressed at Headingley, with another honorary Yorkshireman dazzling the crowd with some fantastic cricket. Maxwell, who is nicknamed The Big Show and has played for Yorkshire as an overseas player this summer, displayed some fantastic reverse-sweeps with the bat as well as also launching Adil Rashid for two huge sixes. However, he saved his show-stopping best for the end of England's run chase when he produced an incredible boundary catch to end Plunkett's entertaining late cameo. He caught the ball with both feet off the ground but, aware he was going to step over the rope, flicked the ball up with his right hand and then caught it in his left as he re-entered the playing area in front of the Western Terrace.

{"original_text": "\"Fracking\" involves pumping water and chemicals into shale rock at pressure. The joint report from the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering say the technique is safe if firms follow best practice and rules are enforced. Exploratory fracking is being mooted in at least seven sites around the UK. The report was commissioned by the government's chief scientist, Sir John Beddington, following the decision last year to halt the UK's most advanced project, in Lancashire, after fracking caused small earth tremors. \"Our main conclusions are that the environmental risks of hydraulic fracturing for shale can can be safely managed provided there is best practice observed and provided it's enforced through strong regulation,\" said the report's chair, Prof Robert Mair from Cambridge University. \"The UK regulatory system is up to the job for the present very small scale exploration activities, but there would need to be strengthening of the regulators if the government decides to proceed with more shale gas extraction, particularly at the production stage,\" he told BBC News. The report contains 10 top-line recommendations for strengthening regulations, including: Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves drilling down into shale formations and fracturing the rock using explosives or hydraulic pressure. Water is pumped in containing sand particles that prop open the cracks in the shale, allowing the gas out, and a tiny amount of chemicals. In the US, concerns have been raised that the gas or the chemicals can enter drinking water supplies. However, the report concludes that gas contamination should not be a problem - the risk is \"very low\" - provided that fracking takes place at a depth of many hundreds of metres, a long way below the level of aquifers, and that the wells are properly constructed. Each well is lined with layers of steel and cement; and if this stays intact, the scientists conclude, gas leakage should not be a problem. They also say that with good management of waste water, chemical contamination should be avoided; they criticise the US practice of leaving it in open ponds, which would not be permitted in the UK. The report says the risk that fracking will generate significant seismic events is also small. The actual explosions are far too small to be noticed at the surface, said Prof Zoe Shipton from the University of Strathclyde. \"If the fluid moves into existing faults in the rock that are close to slipping anyway, you'll bring that slippage forward in time,\" she said. \"But the Magnitude 2.3 event in Blackpool last year - that is like a lorry going past your house - in fact the British Geological Survey can't measure below Magnitude 2 in towns because of the traffic.\" The European industry is in its infancy compared with the US, and governments' views on the technology are mixed. Fracking has been banned in France, but countries such as Poland are taking a strong interest. UK ministers see shale gas as a way of cheaply bridging the transition to a low-carbon fuel mix, despite calculations showing that widespread adoption without carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology would mean future UK governments missing their legally-binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Prof Mair said climate impacts were outside his remit, but a detailed look at the issue should happen at some stage. \"The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering believe this is an issue that needs to be addressed,\" he said. \"It's a very wide issue - energy policy, CO2 reduction, all of that needs to be looked at - and gas in general is part of that.\" Follow Richard on Twitter", "text_perturb": "`` Fracking '' involves pumping water and chemical into shale rock at pressure.

Hank Green, a prominent video producer and entrepreneur, said YouTube gave musicians \"new revenue streams.\" The row comes as the video-sharing website renews its agreements with major record labels. Prominent voices in the music industry have accused YouTube of paying low royalties for music video streams and turning a blind eye to copyright infringement. In March, the Recording Industry Association of America said YouTube paid \"meagre\" royalties when compared to subscription music services such as Apple Music and Spotify. On Monday, music manager Irving Azoff, formerly in charge of Ticketmaster and who now represents artists such as Christina Aguilera, said artists were paid a \"pittance\" on the advertising-funded site. In an open letter, he said YouTube did not allow musicians to put their tracks behind its YouTube Red pay-wall to earn more revenue. He also accused YouTube of \"hiding behind\" a so-called \"safe harbour\" provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which stops websites being held responsible for copyright infringement by users, in some circumstances. Trying to keep copyright music off YouTube was \"an impossible, expensive game of'whack-a-mole',\" he said. \"When the artist sends a'take down' it should be a'stay down'.\" YouTube said comparing subscription services to free advertising-funded websites was \"like comparing what a cab driver earns from fares to what they earn showing ads in their taxi.\" In a blog post, the company said it paid \"a majority\" - more than 50 - of its advertising income to content creators and the music industry. However, it added that the average YouTube user listened to only one hour of music a month, compared to the 55 hours a month it said Spotify subscribers consumed. The company said its Content ID technology could detect when copyright music was uploaded to the website and automatically dealt with 99.5 of copyright claims. It said record labels had the choice of whether to earn advertising revenue from unauthorised uploads or have them blocked indefinitely, and that half of the 3bn (PS2bn) it had paid out to the music industry came from monetising these \"unauthorised uploads\" by the public. Income from its subscription service YouTube Red, available in the US, was shared with content creators and musicians in the same way as advertising revenue. YouTube has been separately criticised by video-makers who say Content ID does not respect the \"fair use\" of television and film extracts, which is protected by a provision of the DMCA.

{"original_text": "The latest stage of the government's auto-enrolment programme has seen a 95 compliance rate among small businesses. All employers will eventually need to offer pensions to anyone who is over the age of 22 and who earns more than PS10,000 a year. The introduction is a gradual process with 66 of employees now signed up. The latter stages are widely seen as the most challenging as employees such as nannies, care workers, plumbers and bar staff are enrolled into a pension. This means employers who only have one or two staff may need to add a pensions policy to their pay and conditions. This group represents more than a third of those who will be required to comply with the rules from now. Employees have the option to opt out of saving. The auto-enrolment system was started in 2012, and aimed to ensure that workers save to enable them to top-up their state pension on retirement. This has reversed falls in workplace pension saving. The full roll-out is taking years to complete, but MPs and regulators have welcomed a successful take-up by workers and compliance by employers - both of whom pay into the pension pot. \"The compliance rates achieved have been consistently at the top of our expectations and the savings landscape has been transformed. But we know the job is not yet done and there are still significant challenges ahead,\" said Charles Counsell, executive director for automatic enrolment at the Pensions Regulator.

There is concern that some workers may feel that the pensions box has been ticked, only later to find that their pension does not offer them the standard of living they are expecting.

Steve Webb, now director of policy at Royal London insurance company, was pensions minister when the system was created. He said such contribution rates were \"woefully inadequate to provide a decent retirement.\" \"The fact that the average employer contribution rate among firms so far is just 3 shows the mountain that we have to climb,\" he said. \"Getting the combined rate of contributions from employers and employees to realistic levels as quickly as possible should be the central focus of the 2017 review of automatic enrolment.

{"original_text": "The Anglo-Dutch giant's chief executive Ben van Beurden accepted that Arctic drilling \"divides society,\" but said the world needs new sources of oil. Greenpeace said Shell was taking a \"massive risk\" in a \"pristine\" region. Shell also announced a 15bn (PS9.9bn) cut in global spending, and profit figures that disappointed investors. The cut in investment - spread over three years - comes after a fall in the oil price. Although the price is expected to remain lower in the medium term, Mr van Beurden said: \"We are taking a prudent approach here and we must be careful not to over-react to the recent fall in oil prices. \"Shell is taking structured decisions to balance growth and returns.\" Shell also said profits for the last three months of 2014 had risen to 4.2bn compared with 2.2bn in the same period a year earlier. The numbers were below analysts' forecasts, prompting a big sell-off of Shell's shares, which were down by 4.3 at the end of Thursday. Shell put its Arctic plans on hold two years ago after a drilling vessel ran aground and legal wrangles in the US. The company has already spent 1bn on preparing its drilling work in Alaska's Chukchi Sea. It was costing Shell several hundred millions of dollars a year to keep the existing operations ticking over, the company said. Mr van Beurden said there were still issues to resolve before drilling began, such as over operating permits and getting further facilities in place. But he hoped to see work begin in the summer. \"We will only do this if we feel that we can do it responsibly,\" Mr van Beurden told the BBC. \"I think that we are as well prepared as any company can be to mitigate the risks.\" He also pointed out that there are already other energy companies operating in the Arctic. Mr van Beurden said that the world needs new sources of oil and gas to meet demand and that the Arctic offered potentially the biggest resource base ever found. Estimates have put the estimates at some 24bn barrels in Alaska. Environmentalists have campaigned against Shell for years. Greenpeace's Charlie Kronick, said: \"Despite announcing cuts [in global investment], Shell hasn't taken the opportunity to cut its most high-cost high-risk project. \"Shell is taking a massive risk doggedly chasing oil in the Arctic, not just with shareholder value, but with the pristine Arctic environment. \"A spill there will be environmentally and financially catastrophic. It's time for investors to recognise that it's impossible for Shell to justify its continued pursuit of offshore Arctic oil.\" As the first of the major oil companies to report its figures for last year, Shell plays the role of the canary in the coal mine - or on the oil rig. After a rather sickly 2013, profits are actually up. But the impact of the low oil price is clearly biting. The company announced that it would be cutting investment over the next three years in new exploration and the development of oil and gas fields, a move that will raise fresh concerns about its business in the North Sea. Last summer Shell announced the loss of 250 jobs in Aberdeen. The chief executive, Ben Van Beurden, said that the company would not \"over-react\" to the oil price which has fallen by 60 since last June. And of course a low oil price means lower prices at the petrol pumps for consumers. He said though that Shell would look at further cuts if necessary. As well as the North Sea, the company's operations in Nigeria, where it recently paid a PS55m bill to clean up pollution after a major oil spill, and the Arctic will also come under increased scrutiny. Meanwhile, Shell's profits for the quarter after stripping out one-off items, such as asset sales and accounting changes, were 3.26bn. That is a 12 rise on the same period a year earlier but down from the 5.85bn in the June to September quarter. Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: \"As expected, fourth quarter performance has been impacted by the lower oil price, although downstream refining operations have provided some counterbalance. \"More broadly, the numbers are below forecast, with the news providing a difficult start to the oil majors' results season. \"In all, and despite the disappointing numbers, the dividend payment remains core, with the payment being left unchanged.\" Shell said it was spending 12bn on dividends to shareholders in 2014, and also repurchased 3.3bn of its own shares. The group said it had slowed the pace of share buybacks to conserve cash and that near-term oil prices would dictate how it progressed. Oil prices have fallen by almost 60 since June because of weak global demand and a boom in US shale production. Shell's main rivals, BP and Total, have also announced large cutbacks in capital expenditure in recent weeks.", "text_perturb": "The Anglo-Dutch giant 's chief executive Ben vanguard Beurden accepted that Arctic drilling `` divides society , '' but said the world needs new sources of oil.

The numbers equal below analysts ' forecasts , prompting a big sell-off of Shell 's shares , which equal down by 4. 3 at the remnant of Thursday. Shell put its Arctic architectural plan on hold two years ago after a drilling vessel ran aground and legal wrangles in the US. The troupe has already spent 1bn on preparing its drilling work in Alaska 's Chukchi Sea. It was costing Shell several hundred millions of dollars a year to keep the existing operations beat over , the company said. Mr van Beurden said there were withal issues to resolve before drilling began , such as over operating permits and getting further facilities in place. But he hoped to see work set out in the summer. `` We bequeath only do this if we feel that we can do it responsibly , '' Mr van Beurden told the BBC. `` I think that we are as well prepared as any company terminate be to mitigate the risks. `` He too pointed out that there are already other energy companies operating in the Arctic. Mr van Beurden said that the world necessitate new sources of oil and gas to meet demand and that the Arctic offered potentially the biggest resource base ever found. Estimates have put the estimation at some 24bn barrels in Alaska. Environmentalists have campaigned against racing shell for years. Greenpeace 's Charlie Kronick , said : `` Despite announcing cuts [ in global investment ] , Shell has n't taken the chance to cut its most high-cost high-risk project. `` Shell is taking a massive risk doggedly chasing oil in the north frigid zone , not just with shareholder value , but with the pristine north frigid zone environment. `` A spill there bequeath be environmentally and financially catastrophic. It 's time for investors to recognise that it 's impossible for Shell to justify its continued pursuit of offshore Arctic rock oil. `` As the first of the major oil companies to report its figures for final year , Shell plays the role of the canary in the coal mine - or on the oil rig. After a rather seedy 2013 , profits are actually up. But the shock of the low oil price is clearly biting. The company declare that it would be cutting investment over the next three years in new exploration and the development of oil and gas fields , a move that will raise fresh concerns about its business in the North Sea. Last summer Shell announced the loss of 250 line of work in Aberdeen. The chief executive , Ben Van Beurden , said that the company would not `` over-react '' to the oil price which has fallen by 60 since terminal June. And of course a low oil price means lower prices at the petrol pumps for consumer. He said though that Shell would look at farther cuts if necessary. As well as the North sea , the company 's operations in Nigeria , where it recently paid a PS55m bill to clean up pollution after a major oil spill , and the Arctic will also come under increased scrutiny. Meanwhile , cuticle 's profits for the quarter after stripping out one-off items , such as asset sales and accounting changes , were 3. 26bn. That represent a 12 rise on the same period a year earlier but down from the 5. 85bn in the june to September quarter. Keith Bowman , equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers , said : `` As expected , fourth quarter performance has been impacted by the lower oil price , although downstream refining operations have provided some offset. `` More broadly , the numbers are below forecast , with the news providing a difficult start to the oil majors ' results time of year. `` In all , and despite the disappointing numbers game , the dividend payment remains core , with the payment being left unchanged. `` Shell said it was spending 12bn on dividend to shareholders in 2014 , and also repurchased 3. 3bn of its ain shares. The group said it had slowed the rate of share buybacks to conserve cash and that near-term oil prices would dictate how it progressed. Oil prices have fallen by almost 60 since june because of weak global demand and a boom in US shale production. Shell 's main rivals , BP and Total , have also announced large cutbacks in capital expenditure in recent calendar week. ", "label": 1}

Fairly comfortable at right-back, as steady as always, and was in control defensively. Was probably the pick of the back four. Stepping out, he made the opening goal. Passed the ball well throughout. Strong, powerful figure at the back. Was never put under significant pressure. Attacked the by-line as always and delivered an early cross for Moussa Dembele to head on target. Man of the match, dominated proceedings, looked in control and showed flair at times. Won a tackle with O'Connor that probably put paid to the defender for the next five or 10 minutes.

An attacking threat throughout. He plays the position well and scored the opening goal. Scored Celtic's second goal, laid on a couple, won the penalty for the third.

Fairly easy at right-back , as steady as always , and was in control defensively. Was probably the pick of the hinder four. step out , he made the opening goal. Passed the egg well throughout. Strong , hefty figure at the back. Was never put under significant press. Attacked the by-line as always and delivered an other cross for Moussa Dembele to head on target. Man of the match , dominated proceedings , face in control and showed flair at times. Won a tackle with O'Connor that probably put paid to the shielder for the next five or 10 minutes. head by example. Solid display , worked very hard , not over-spectacular and should have score at the end after getting himself into a great position. Always capable of make out something in the game. An attacking terror throughout. He plays the lieu well and scored the opening goal. Scored Celtic 's nd goal , laid on a couple , won the penalty for the third. I asked the question before , could he step up ? And I think he coif. Probably Celtic 's quiet player. Was n't require as much as he would have wanted to be. Probably the quietest we 've seen him but even so scored his goal. Not as needlelike as he normally is but led the line well. Did what he had suffice after coming on for Roberts. Kept it nice and solid in midfield. Another who did his job well and kept the functioning ticking over after coming on for Rogic. Did n't have much time to impress as a late sub for Forrest but did n't exercise anything wrong. Pat Bonner and Willie Miller live talking to BBC Scotland 's Richard Wilson. ", "label": 1}

The stars are not only extremely massive, but they are also extremely bright. Together, these nine stars outshine our Sun by a factor of 30 million, said Prof Crowther. \"Because they are so massive, they are all close to their so-called Eddington limit, which is the maximum luminosity a star can have before it rips itself apart; and so they've got really powerful outflows.

The question is why this tight corner of space, located in the Tarantula Nebula of the LMC, harbours so many giants.

{"original_text": "Under anti-tax avoidance rules, if someone's tax arrangements are found to be \"abusive\" they must pay back the tax they have avoided. But shadow chancellor Ed Balls pledged a \"genuine deterrent\" by making them liable to pay the same amount again. A Tory spokesman said it was \"feeble stuff\" and Labour had no economic plan. Tax avoidance, unlike tax evasion, is not illegal. Ministers have said it involves \"compliance with the letter but not the spirit of the law.\" In recent years it emerged that companies and individuals had been greatly reducing their liabilities by making use of legal tax shelter schemes. Meanwhile the \"tax gap\" - the difference between the amount of tax owed and collected - rose to PS34bn in the year to April 2013. The government's so-called general anti-abuse rule (GAAR) came into force in July 2013, after Chancellor George Osborne described aggressive tax avoidance - as well as illegal tax evasion - as \"morally repugnant.\" It aimed to \"deter taxpayers from entering into abusive arrangements, and to deter would-be promoters from promoting such arrangements.\" The rule is a broad set of principles designed to prevent tax avoidance, to avoid having constantly to introduce new legislation to tackle individual loopholes. Labour has previously said it would increase transparency in the tax system and prevent dormant companies from trading without paying tax. It has pledged to use some of the money raised from a tax avoidance crackdown for its PS2.5bn NHS funding pledge. Mr Balls said Labour had supported the introduction of the anti-abuse rule, but said it was \"without teeth.\" He said: \"Those who are caught have to repay the tax they tried to avoid, but they do not face a penalty. There is still no disincentive to try and game the system. That is why Labour will bring in a tough penalty regime.... with fines of up to 100 of the value of the tax which was avoided. \"For the first time this will provide a tough and genuine deterrent to those who try to abuse the system and avoid paying their fair share of tax.\" The shadow chancellor said aggressive tax avoiders should be treated the same as people who cheat the welfare system.

Ministers have said it involves `` compliance with the letter but non the spirit of the law. `` In recent years it emerged that companies and individuals had been greatly reducing their liabilities by arrive at use of legal tax shelter schemes. Meanwhile the `` tax gap '' - the divergence between the amount of tax owed and collected - rose to PS34bn in the year to April 2013. The government 's so-called general anti-abuse rule ( GAAR ) come into force in July 2013 , after Chancellor George Osborne described aggressive tax avoidance - as well as illegal tax evasion - as `` morally repugnant. `` It take to `` deter taxpayers from entering into abusive arrangements , and to deter would-be promoters from promoting such arrangements. `` The rule is a all embracing set of principles designed to prevent tax avoidance , to avoid having constantly to introduce new legislation to tackle individual loopholes. Labour has previously said it would increase transparency in the tax system and prevent dormant troupe from trading without paying tax. It has pledged to use some of the money raised from a tax dodging crackdown for its PS2. 5bn NHS funding assurance. Mr Balls enjoin Labour had supported the introduction of the anti-abuse rule , but enjoin it was `` without teeth. `` He said : `` Those who are caught have to repay the tax they try out to avoid , but they do not face a penalty. There is still no deterrence to try and game the system. That is why Labour will contribute in a tough penalty regime. . . . with fine of up to 100 of the value of the tax which was avoided. `` For the first time this will provide a tough and genuine deterrent to those who try to abuse the system and avoid paying their clean share of tax. `` The shadow chancellor said aggressive tax avoiders should be treated the same as people who jockey the welfare system. He added : `` Through measures such as this we can ensure that no-one pays zero tax at the top so we can get the deficit down fairly , invest in our NHS , and maintain public support for the dynamic clear economy we need. `` The proposals were backed by leading lease accountant and tax-reform campaigner Richard Murphy , who was a member of the panel which helped draw up the anti-abuse rules. `` Without such a regime , the GAAR is a toothless tiger providing , at best , Revenue and Customs with the chance to ask those found in default to act as by the rules in future , '' Mr Murphy , who is an adviser to the Trades Union Congress and the Unite union - Labour 's largest financial backer - said. `` With significant penalty attached , the GAAR becomes a more potent threat and , regrettably , in the face of ongoing tax abuse , Revenue and Customs needs as many of those as it can get. `` However , a Conservative spokesman said Labour leader Ed Miliband had been at the heart of former prime minister Gordon Brown 's Treasury as `` year after year '' they broke promise to deal with tax avoidance. `` If Ed thinks empty promises like this will get him into Downing Street , it 's no wonder his own party are lining up to criticise his weak and inefficient leadership , '' the spokesman added.

In 1989, we gave birth to a little girl Jennifer. She was tiny. Oey was scared to pick her up. The morning of 15 April, 1989, that horrible day, was one of the times that he did pick her up before he left the house. He had been playing football with Stephen outside while holding Jennifer in his arms and swinging her in the air.

He was captured in 1943 fighting in the Middle East, and after nine months in Italy, was transferred to forced labour camp E715, part of the Auschwitz complex. There he spent 12 hours a day, six days a week, working with hazardous chemicals in the IG Farben works, but on Sundays they were permitted to play football. \"I think the Germans thought that letting us play football was a quick and easy way of keeping us quiet,\" he said. \"The Red Cross would bring us food parcels, and when they heard about our football, they managed to get us strips for four teams: England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. I was always the Wales goalkeeper. \"It kept us sane, it was a bit of normality, but it sounds wrong somehow to say I've got fond memories of playing football, considering what was going on just over the fence.\" He says as well as keeping up spirits, football played a major role in his survival, and that of many of his fellow prisoners, when they were forced on one of the series of extremely long marches westwards from PoW camps during the final stages of the conflict. Whilst many of Mr Jones's friends died on the march, he believes it is no coincidence that those who had been involved in the Auschwitz football league fared better. \"You could say the football we'd played saved our lives. The football lads were fitter, yes, but more than that, they belonged to a group which kept each other going on the march.\" E715 was located close to Auschwitz III, Monowitz, which held mainly Polish resistance fighters, political dissidents, homosexuals and some captured Soviet troops. Whilst this was not officially a death camp, Mr Jones says it did not take long for him to realise that the inmates at Monowitz were far from safe. \"In the nights you could hear shots coming from Monowitz,\" he said. \"Not bursts like you had when you were fighting, but deliberate, regular every few seconds; like they had a system going. \"We didn't know who they were or why they'd been killed, and we couldn't help but be terrified that we'd be next.\" But when the British PoWs were allowed out to play football, they would be taken to fields next to Auschwitz II, Birkenau, where killing was on an altogether more industrial scale. \"The first Sunday we went to the playing fields, we saw these people - well walking skeletons they were really - digging trenches,\" he said. \"We asked,'Who are those poor sods?' and the German guards shout'Juden', Jews, as if it had been a stupid question. \"We could only play in the summer, because everything was covered in snow through the winter. But when it was hot, this awful stench would waft across from the crematoriums. \"Your imaginations pretty much filled in the gaps for you, but we'd carry on playing football. \"Scoring a goal, making a save or arguing about an offside was the only way you could stop yourself from cracking up.\" Mr Jones says he has spent a great deal of time since the war wondering about how much his German guards had known and cared about what was going on inside Birkenau. \"You have to remember that our guards weren't SS like in Birkenau; they were conscripted squaddies like us,\" he said. \"Dozens of them would come and cheer our football matches and have a laugh with us, and if you got them on their own, you could tell that they were ordinary, decent blokes. \"But if you asked them about Birkenau they'd get angry and scared.'We didn't need to know','they didn't know','it was nothing', and even if it was, then'it wasn't their fault, they weren't SS'.\" \"I had nightmares about Auschwitz for years after the war, but I bet mine were nothing compared with what those Germans must have gone through. \"Some would say they deserve it, but most likely they couldn't have done any more about it than we could have ourselves.\" As the Red Army closed in, on 21 January, 1945 German guards burst into Mr Jones's hut in the middle of the night, and ordered him to leave immediately with whatever he could carry. The Soviets liberated Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945, confirming for the first time the stories of the Holocaust's mass murder, which the Allies had hitherto rubbished as too extreme to be possible. But by the time the Russians arrived, Mr Jones was long gone; as part of the death march west, which killed anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 Allied PoWs. \"We were on the road for 17 weeks, and God knows how many hundreds of miles we traipsed, through Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Austria.\" \"I was 13 stone (82kg) when I was captured, and when I was liberated by the Americans in April 1945, they weighed me, and I was seven stone.\" Mr Jones considers himself one of the lucky ones. \"I was very lucky. I came home to a good wife, who helped me get over it. But lots never really recovered at all,\" he said. \"I think I'm probably the last now.

Leandro Bacuna's late goal gave Villa hope of an unlikely point but the Premier League's bottom club remain eight points from safety. Stoke's second victory in succession moves them up two places to eighth. Villa midfielder Westwood said this week that it has been difficult to watch Match of the Day alongside his son this season because of his team's desperate form. Sadly for Westwood, it will not be any easier this weekend as it was he who conceded the penalty that led to Stoke's first goal, clumsily stopping right-back Bardsley as he broke forward after 50 minutes. When Villa fell 2-0 behind five minutes later there was still over half an hour to play but the visitors' heads dropped, with morale rock-bottom following a 6-0 loss to Liverpool in their previous game and only three league wins all season. Before the match, Villa manager Remi Garde said he was not seeing enough commitment from all his players in training. While they did pull one goal back when Bacuna slotted in as Stoke appealed for handball against Rudy Gestede in the build-up, they never looked like taking anything from the game. Apart from Bacuna's strike, the only occasions when a Villa player looked like putting the ball in the net was when defender Jores Okore twice nearly scored own goals, both times being spared by excellent saves from Mark Bunn. It might be stating the obvious but relegation is surely a certainty. Mark Hughes' side went into this game on the same points total as this stage last season and the victory keeps them on target for another top-10 finish.

Arnautovic was their catalyst throughout, creating their best openings in a poor first half before netting both their goals as the Potters effectively won the game in the first 15 minutes of the second period. While Stoke's set-pieces were often poor, they were always a threat from the flanks in open play.

But BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the \"striking\" language used was evidence that both parts of the coalition were becoming more willing to air their disagreements and grievances in public a year ahead of the general election and less than two weeks before local and European elections. According to sources in Mr Clegg's office, last December Mr Gove overruled the Lib Dem schools minister David Laws to take PS400m from the Basic Need Budget for 2015-17. They claim the money was diverted to help cover a projected PS800m overspend between 2013 and 2016 in the budget of free schools - a project close to Mr Gove's heart. By Alex ForsythBBC Political Correspondent With less than two weeks to go before the local and European elections, increasing tensions between political parties are no surprise. The coalition parties in particular are trying to put clear water between them, and this isn't their first public disagreement. But on this occasion both sides have bandied round strong language - calling the other'pathetic' or'laughable' and describing funding decisions as'lunacy'. Those involved may see it as an opportunity to promote their party's policy and convince voters of what they stand for - in the strongest possible terms. To others it might be viewed as two political parties, both in government, attacking each other and policies they've officially both agreed. They may view this as good tactics. The public may view it differently. Free schools can be set up by parents, teachers, charities, businesses, universities, trusts, religious or voluntary groups, but are funded directly by central government. There are currently 174 free schools in England with another 116 approved to open from this September. A Lib Dem source said the Conservatives were \"putting the needs of a handful of their pet projects ahead of the requirements of the other 24,000 schools in the country.\" \"Michael Gove was warned by the schools minister David Laws that this was a bad idea but the zealot pressed on anyway,\" said the source. Mr Gove's allies say the Basic Need Budget will still rise by more than PS200m a year in 2015-17 and argue that expansion of free schools will lead to more school places overall. Research last month highlighted by the Labour Party suggested the government was currently funding free schools for 1,500 more pupils than were actually attending. A spokesman for Mr Gove disputed the claim by critics of free schools that the places being created were not necessarily where they were most needed. He said: \"The suggestion we are cutting money for new places in areas of need to pay for free schools where they are not needed is totally wrong. \"These claims pretend that money spent in free schools is not creating new places in areas of need. That is simply not true.\" Research by the Times Educational Supplement suggests that: The row comes days after emails leaked to the BBC indicated senior Department for Education officials had raised concerns school places may have to be cut if the Lib Dems' free school meals policy for infant children was implemented. A Conservative source at the Department for Education said: \"This is a pathetic attempt by the Lib Dems to divert attention from their botched school food policy which councils are being forced to fund by cutting money for school places. \"They opted for free schools and backed them from the start. For the Lib Dems to attack them now is frankly risible.\" Labour's shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, said free schools \"had the Lib Dem stamp of approval from day one. \"They're as much to blame for the failings as the Tories.\" Mr Hunt said there was a \"national crisis\" over primary school places and said the secretary of state was behaving irresponsibly. The Lib Dems and Tories have also previously clashed over the employment of classroom staff without formal teaching qualifications and Mr Gove's decision not to re-appoint Labour peer Sally Morgan to watchdog Ofsted. Two days ago, a report by a cross-party group of MPs said financial management of some free schools was inadequate. The Public Accounts Committee said procedures were \"overly reliant\" on whistleblowers to uncover financial problems.

A Lib Dem source said the Conservatives were `` putting the needs of a handful of their preferred projects ahead of the requirements of the other 24,000 schools in the country. `` `` Michael Gove was warned by the schools rector David Laws that this was a bad idea but the zealot pressed on anyway , '' said the source. mr Gove 's allies say the Basic Need Budget will still rise by more than PS200m a year in 2015-17 and argue that expansion of free schools will lead to more school places overall. Research last month highlighted by the Labour company suggested the government was currently funding free schools for 1,500 more pupils than were actually attending. A spokesman for Mr Gove disputed the claim by critics of free schools that the places being created were non necessarily where they were most needed. He said : `` The suggestion we are cutting money for new places in areas of need to pay for free schools where they are not needed is whole wrong. `` These claims pretend that money spent in free schools is not creating new property in areas of need. That is simply not genuine. `` Research by the Times Educational Supplement suggests that : The row comes days after emails leaked to the BBC indicated senior section for Education officials had raised concerns school places may have to be cut if the Lib Dems ' free school meals policy for infant children was implemented. A Conservative source at the Department for Education said : `` This is a pathetic attempt by the Lib Dems to divert attention from their botched school food policy which councils follow being forced to fund by cutting money for school places. `` They opted for devoid schools and backed them from the start. For the Lib Dems to set on them now is frankly risible. `` Labour 's shadow education secretary , Tristram Hunt , said free schools `` own the Lib Dem stamp of approval from day one. `` They 're every bit much to blame for the failings as the Tories. `` Mr Hunt said there was a `` national crisis '' over primary school places and said the secretary of dos was behaving irresponsibly. The Lib Dems and Tories feature also previously clashed over the employment of classroom staff without formal teaching qualifications and Mr Gove 's decision not to re-appoint Labour peer Sally Morgan to watchdog Ofsted. Two solar day ago , a report by a cross-party group of MPs said financial management of some free schools was inadequate. The Public Accounts Committee said procedures live `` overly reliant '' on whistleblowers to uncover financial problems. The government said many of the commission 's concerns were `` misplaced. ``", "label": 1}

Then I realised that one man was staring intensely at a very chunky laptop - this was Dr Craig Wright. He carried on working, apparently unaware that we had entered the room. Once we had been introduced he gradually warmed up - especially when it came to performing the demonstration that showed that he did have access to the cryptographic keys used by Satoshi when he made the first Bitcoin transaction in 2009. We had arrived wondering just how convincing a case would be made that the almost mythical creator of Bitcoin was at last stepping out of the shadows. What we saw seemed impressive - though it would need a far higher level of expertise than we possess to be certain. But Jon Matonis, a senior figure in the Bitcoin world, was in the room watching, having had his own demonstration some time before. And the news that Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, was also convinced provided more reassurance. Now Craig Wright has published his evidence on his blog, it will be examined in minute detail for any chink in his case. But put aside the question of whether you believe him or not - and he told me he didn't care either way - there were still plenty of questions we wanted to put to the fascinating, if somewhat prickly Dr Wright. Why keep his secret so long? Why come out now? What about that run-in with the Australian tax authorities? And is he fabulously rich, with a huge stock of Bitcoin? At our first meeting - without a television camera - we roamed freely over all sorts of territory. We learned that he ran a substantial business in London, employing quite a few people here in what seemed to be some kind of Bitcoin trading and consultancy operation. We challenged him about that tax investigation - he conceded that there was what he called an \"audit\" underway in Australia but insisted that this was mainly due to the tax authorities there not really understanding Bitcoin. We asked where the pseudonym had come from - he mentioned a 17th century libertarian philosopher called Nakamoto but said he'd keep the Satoshi bit to himself. He talked of the French writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, whose statement refusing the Nobel Prize is used in the Satoshi-signed file given as evidence in the blog published today. His politics were very far from the \"lefty\" Sartre, he explained, but like him he did not want his identity to be defined by one thing - he refused to be Craig \"Satoshi\" just as Sartre did not want to be Jean-Paul Nobel. What he wouldn't say is how many Bitcoins he has - \"that would be telling\" - though he indicated that he would not be spending any of them in a hurry. He told us that he had a \"nice big house and a nice fast car\" in London, went on holidays to Paris, and didn't feel the need to acquire vast riches. The second time we met, to film a television interview, the mood changed. It was immediately clear that he hated the whole process, refusing to move from behind his laptop to a more spacious room where the shot would have been much better. At first, he insisted that he would give an answer to just one question - why he had decided to go public after all these years. Once we started filming he opened up a little, but mainly because he wanted to express his anger at, as he sees it, being forced into the public eye. \"I don't want money, I don't want fame, I don't want adoration, I just want to be left alone,\" he said with some venom. He accused journalists of threatening to make up stories about him if he did not cooperate and said lies had been told that would affect his family and his staff. It seems his main grievance surrounds the stories that spread last December when he was first identified as a potential Satoshi, then dismissed by some as a hoaxer. At that time, questions were asked about his academic and business career, and there were some who said he just did not have the intellectual capacity to be the man behind Bitcoin.

{"original_text": "So for the one tasked with replacing Karl Robinson as MK Dons manager, changing the mark of a man who had been in charge for more than half of the club's entire existence will be quite a renovation. Robinson, once the third-longest serving boss in England's top four divisions, oversaw the development of England international Dele Alli and led Dons to the Championship for the first time. So, having been engrained in the fundamental DNA of a club only founded in 2004, which prides itself on the football it plays and the development of youngsters, can this carry on under someone else? \"What we are talking about is playing modern football,\" chairman Pete Winkelman said. \"We're a young football club and we want to play football like the big boys play, we might not play it at the same speed or accuracy but I want our supporters to recognise that football. \"The way that we play can be interpreted in many different ways. Karl's interpreted one way, and there's a massive spectrum for other people to interpret it differently. \"You look at the difference between how Chelsea and Tottenham are playing, Bournemouth and Liverpool. They're all playing a similar kind of football but all doing it completely differently.\" This club needs to be a Premier League club one day Robinson was aged just 29 in May 2010 when Winkelman promoted him from Paul Ince's assistant to full-time boss after former England midfielder Ince left Stadium:MK. Failures in successive League One play-off campaigns in his first two seasons in charge showed signs of things to come, and Robinson finally delivered promotion to the Championship in 2015 thanks in no small part to the goals of on-loan Will Grigg and Benik Afobe. But after a dismal Championship season in which they got relegated with only four wins from January onwards, Robinson left on Sunday with the Dons 19th in League One. \"Ironically it's that promotion that changes the whole nature of club and we came back to League One with this burden of expectation that we need to be a Championship club,\" said Winkelman. \"To be honest, this club needs to be a Premier League club one day. I've built a Premier League stadium, Milton Keynes is going to be a top-10 city in the country and we need to have a top-10 ambition. \"It's one thing thinking it, it's another thing delivering it. But where we cannot be is 19th in League One. It's the lowest position we've been in since this stadium. We're going backwards, not forwards.\" It was during that promotion-winning campaign that one of the club's greatest nights to date came - when they defeated Louis van Gaal's Manchester United 4-0 in the League Cup. And Robinson, despite the club finding itself in one of its worst positions since he took over, said his overriding feeling after leaving the club is pride. Why? \"The people of Milton Keynes, the identity, the growth of youth in Milton Keynes and the net profit in transfer fees in six years, the development of young players,\" he told BBC Three Counties Radio. \"The dream was to fill the stadium - (I was the) first person to do that, the first person to beat AFC Wimbledon. \"50 of the squad is home-grown, which is phenomenal in modern-day football I think.\" Instead of dissecting Saturday's 3-0 defeat by Southend United, a solitary Robinson pitched up at a golf course on Monday, trying to take a step back from what had happened. \"I still believed they'd finish in the play-offs. I said that to the chairman on Sunday,\" he continued. \"But I have no arguments with the decisions that were made. I have no problems with anybody.\" Also left working out what has gone wrong are Dons fans, some of whom are unhappy with the recruitment strategy, overseen by the chairman's son Bobby. The club use a recruitment database first set up by Paul Mitchell, who went on to work with Mauricio Pochettino at Southampton and Tottenham, to help make a list of potential signings. But fan questions have arisen after players such as Matthew Upson, Dale Jennings and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas failed to make an impact in the club's Championship season. \"We've made mistakes when we haven't signed to the (recruitment) list: 85 of the players last year weren't on our recruitment list,\" said Pete Winkelman. \"It's something we've put more right this year, but again, not all of them were on the list. \"There are successes and failures in that recruitment list, but the successes hugely outweigh the failures. \"I want to get rid of this thing that we make decisions. I've never picked the team, other than the amount of money people can spend on somebody. I've never had any other influence in the football, and nor has Bob. \"People trying to get at me will get at Bob. It's an easy hit but what I can rely on is one of the strongest databases in football.\" Winkelman now has to sift through \"around 200\" names and is even considering creating a technical director role to work alongside the new manager. Meanwhile, Robinson wants to get back into management as soon as possible and has already been asked whether he would ever want to return to MK Dons. \"It was a very strange question to be asked 24 hours after leaving.

{"original_text": "Media playback is not supported on this device Five goals were scored in the first half, with Greg Stewart and Kane Hemmings striking early for Dundee. Ross County captain Andrew Davies headed in from a corner before Rory Loy diverted home Hemmings' shot. Alex Schalk netted on half-time, but Craig Wighton and Stewart with a fine solo goal made the points safe late on. After seven minutes Stewart drove through the heart of the County defence before turning the ball onto his favoured left foot and curling it into the bottom corner. Two minutes later Hemmings took full advantage of slackness in the Staggies defence and knocked home his 23rd goal of the campaign. It was no more than Paul Hartley's side deserved after a whirlwind start. Jim McIntyre's team eventually woke up and reduced the deficit after a succession of corners. Davies ghosted in at the front post and with a glancing header knocked the ball beyond David Mitchell to give the travelling fans hope of retaining their place in the top half of the table. And they should have been back on level terms when Michael Gardyne's cross was met on the volley by Martin Woods but the midfielder hammered the ball over the crossbar.

Across the UK, overtime and additional payments have increased by more than a third, to PS168m, in 201516 - with one doctor in Lancashire making almost PS375,000 in the space of 12 months. In total, 23 NHS trusts had to pay at least one consultant more than PS100,00 for extra work, with another 39 paying at least one more than PS50,000.

Work is now underway to develop these local banks into integrated regional and national staff banks to allow greater flexibility across new hampshire Scotland and minimise reliance on agency staff. `` In the meantime the use of overtime and locum stave allows NHS Boards to respond to periods of planned and unplanned absence including long term sickness , unexpected vacancies and maternity and paternity leave ensuring service continuity during these times. ``", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "Ali Asghar Zarean told state TV that Iran would sign an agreement with China to modify the reactor before doing so. On Monday, the semi-official Fars news agency cited unnamed sources as saying the reactor had been decommissioned. It would represent a final step towards the implementation of July's nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Iran has agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities in return for the lifting of crippling sanctions. Iran has for years been building a heavy-water nuclear facility at Arak, the spent fuel from which would contain plutonium suitable for a nuclear bomb. The P51 group of world powers - the US, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany - had originally wanted Arak dismantled because of the proliferation risk. But they eventually agreed that Iran could redesign the reactor so it would not produce any weapons-grade plutonium. Monday's report by Fars, which is close to the powerful Revolutionary Guards, said technicians had removed the core of the existing reactor and poured concrete into the cavity. In July, Iran agreed a landmark nuclear deal with six world powers to limit its sensitive nuclear activities for more than a decade in return for the lifting of crippling sanctions. The US is confident the agreement will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran says it has the right to nuclear energy - and stresses that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only. Iran will not see the UN, US and EU sanctions lifted until the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), certifies that it has fulfilled its commitments under the deal. The precise date of the so-called \"implementation day\" has not been determined. But Iran says it has met those commitments earlier than expected and last week US Secretary of State John Kerry declared: \"We are days away from implementation.\" The sanctions have cost Iran more than more than 160bn (PS102bn) in oil revenue since 2012 alone. Once they are lifted, the country will be able to resume selling oil on international markets and using the global financial system for trade. Iran has the fourth largest oil reserves in the world and the energy industry is braced for lower prices. Iran will also be able to access more than 100bn in assets frozen overseas. But on Tuesday, Mr Zarean insisted that Iran would not decommission the reactor until it had signed a deal with China regarding its redesign - something that is expected next week. \"Definitely, we will not apply any physical change in this field until a final agreement is finalised,\" he said, without making reference to the Fars report directly. Mr Zarean also said that once the modifications were completed and Arak went online, Iran hoped to export excess heavy water produced there to the US for research purposes, via a third country. Iran estimates it will need about 6 of the 20 tonnes a year of heavy water it will produce for medical isotopes.

He is leading an online course on economics and politics, with the University of Nottingham, which will be available free on the Futurelearn online university network set up by the Open University.

He ranks Gordon Brown above David Cameron or Tony Blair on their grasp of economics - and says that all politicians can be guilty of looking for economic theories that confirm their political inclinations.

{"original_text": "Speaking about the 1948 contract Nye Bevan, the founding father of the NHS, offered consultants, he said he had \"stuffed their mouths with gold.\" That gold was the ability to continue private practice - something senior doctors have carefully guarded since. Down the years, several ministers have had a look at the issue, but concluded it was simply too tricky to tackle. One former health secretary told me they thought consultants would simply walk away en masse if the government got tough. There has been some movement. In fact, the current contract had a little nibble at restricting private practice, by insisting that any doctor doing fewer than 11 shifts (of four hours each) a week offers any extra work to the NHS first before accepting private work. It has probably had some impact, but only a little. A full-time contract is 10 shifts, so it ties them to only an extra four hours a week before they are free to work in the private sector. But after years of shying away from the issue, the government looks like it wants to tackle this head on. It is not being explicit in coming out and saying it wants curbs on private practice. But the implications of the move by NHS England to publish earnings is clear: there is a suspicion that some doctors are raking it in and that affects their motivation when it comes to the NHS - both in terms of working extra hours for the health service and how productive they really want to be - and by publishing the details there is a hope it will make doctors think twice about how much they do. Longer NHS waiting lists means more private work as either people will pay to go private or, and this is more common, the NHS has to pay for patients to be seen privately. The private market is worth PS4.6bn a year, according to market analysts Laing Buisson, with a quarter coming via NHS referrals. At a time when money is tight and ministers want to get more seven-day services, tackling this is clearly an attractive proposition. Although with the consultant contract currently in the process of being renegotiated (talks have slowed because of the junior doctor dispute), expect consultants to be hopping mad that their pay is once again in the headlines. It promises to be the mother of all battles. But if the register of private work is published, what will it show? What is known about the extent of private work is pretty sketchy. A British Medical Association survey from 2009 suggested about half of doctors in the UK (it's not limited to England) did private work - but this was a fall from six in 10 when it was done several years before that. Of those that did private work, a quarter earn under PS10,000 a year, while one in six made in excess of PS100,000. This included private hospital work, alongside earnings from other sources such as providing advice to pharmaceutical companies and assessments for insurance companies. But it must be said this was a self-selecting poll - doctors were not compelled to take part, so it is hard to gauge whether it was truly representative. There are plenty of specialities where private work is not so easy to come by. But there are others - orthopaedic surgery, urology, ophthalmology and anaesthetics to name just four - where there is plenty of work. It means for some, earnings can be extremely high. Average basic salary for NHS work is PS89,000 in England. But this ignores a number of ways doctors can make much more. There are bonuses - called clinical excellence awards - which can be worth tens of thousands of pounds a year. Once awarded, they are difficult to take away. And then there is overtime work. For some, this can be pretty lucrative - a BBC investigation earlier this year found one made PS375,000 in a year. Now that figure is very revealing. That consultant was thought to be on a special deal as they worked in an area where there is a shortage of consultants.

{"original_text": "Aston Villa's Jordan Ayew opened the scoring on 62 minutes, curling the ball past Ley Matampi in the Leopards goal. Paul-Jose M'Poku equalised for DR Congo with a sensational long-range effort from outside the box. West Ham's Andre Ayew then coolly dispatched a winning penalty, sending Matampi the wrong way to seal the win. It marks Ghana's sixth consecutive Nations Cup semi-finals appearance, as they seek to end an agonising 35-year wait for a continental title. In a game that only properly sparked to life in the second half in Oyem, DR Congo - and their captain Dieumerci Mbokani in particular - were left to rue several missed chances early on. The Hull City striker's best opportunity came on six minutes, after a terrible mix-up in the Ghana defence, but he hit the post when he had the goal at his mercy. Mbokani then teed up the competition's top scorer Junior Kabananga on 25 minutes, who fired high over the bar. The Congolese talisman again broke through the Ghana defence, only to slice his chance into the side netting. Ghana showed a lot more intent in the second half, with Wakaso whipping a free-kick at Matampi, who saved with his feet. Jordan Ayew - the younger of the two brothers - scored his first of the tournament, surging into the box and stroking the ball home confidently and decisively. The lead lasted all of five minutes, with M'Poku unleashing a breathtaking long-range shot with the outside of the boot that arrowed into the top corner. Ghana continued to press and were awarded a penalty when Christian Atsu went down in the box after contact from Lomalisa Mutambala, who was lucky not to receive a second yellow card. Andre Ayew then coolly dispatched the spot-kick, sending Matampi the wrong way, to grab his second of the competition. Leopards substitute Cedric Bakambu missed several chances to equalise in the final minutes, forcing a good save from Razak and finding space in the box at the death before shooting badly wide from close range. Atsu could have finished it for Ghana in injury time, but the busy Matampi produced a great save at his feet.

Paul-Jose M'Poku equate for DR Congo with a sensational long-range effort from outside the box. occident Ham 's Andre Ayew then coolly dispatched a winning penalty , sending Matampi the wrong way to seal the win. It marks Ghana 's sixth consecutive Nations Cup semi-finals appearance , as they seek to end an agonising 35-year time lag for a continental title. In a game that only properly sparked to spirit in the second half in Oyem , DR Congo - and their captain Dieumerci Mbokani in particular - were left to rue several missed chances early on. The isaac hull City striker 's best opportunity came on six minutes , after a terrible mix-up in the Ghana defence , but he hit the post when he had the goal at his mercy. Mbokani then teed up the competition 's top scorer Junior Kabananga on 25 minutes , who fired high up over the bar. The Congolese talisman once more broke through the Ghana defence , only to slice his chance into the side netting. Ghana showed a lot more spirit in the second half , with Wakaso whipping a free-kick at Matampi , who saved with his feet. Jordan Ayew - the younger of the two brothers - scored his first of the tournament , surging into the box and stroking the ball domicile confidently and decisively. The lead lasted all of five minutes , with M'Poku unleashing a breathtaking long-range shot with the exterior of the boot that arrowed into the top corner. Ghana stay on to press and were awarded a penalty when Christian Atsu went down in the box after contact from Lomalisa Mutambala , who was lucky not to receive a second yellow card. Andre Ayew then coolly dispatched the spot-kick , sending Matampi the ill timed way , to grab his second of the competition. Leopards substitute Cedric Bakambu missed several chances to equalise in the final minutes , forcing a good save from Razak and finding space in the box at the death before shooting badly wide from close fitting range. Atsu could have finished it for Ghana in injury time , but the busy Matampi produced a peachy save at his feet.

{"original_text": "The system can involve withdrawal of medication, food and fluids. It can offer a peaceful and dignified death but there have been problems with its implementation, the government-commissioned review is set to say. Health officials said the review was expected to recommend the LCP should be phased out within six to 12 months. The system was developed at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and the city's Marie Curie hospice in the 1990s to provide a model of best practice in the care of dying patients. It can mean an end to invasive tests, treatment or feeding through tubes that is deemed to cause unnecessary suffering at the end of life - but it should be discussed with the patient, family or carer where possible. The pathway was developed during the late 1990s at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, in conjunction with the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute. It was intended to provide uniform, high-quality, dignified care for dying patients - whether they were in hospital, at home, in a care home or in a hospice. Previously, there were concerns that care had been patchy, with some hospitals failing to meet acceptable standards, and accusations that people were subjected to invasive treatment and testing that offered no chance of preventing death, but merely prolonged their suffering. Under the LCP, patients are regularly reviewed to ascertain whether medication should be stopped - and whether fluids should be withdrawn once they have ceased to be able to eat and drink. However, families have complained relatives were put on the pathway without their consent, and that death has been hastened in people who were not dying imminently. Critics say that it is impossible for doctors to predict when death is imminent, so the decision to put a patient on the pathway is at worst self-fulfilling. There have also been suggestions that the pathway has been used to help hospitals save money. NHS Trusts do receive payouts for hitting targets related to its use - but the suggestion that the pathway has been used for cynical reasons has been vigorously denied by the Department of Health. The Department of Health (DoH) in England set up an independent review amid fears the LCP was being used to hasten death, to clear beds and save money, and that patients or their families were not being consulted. The review, led by crossbench peer Baroness Julia Neuberger, applies only to England. The LCP is also used in Scotland and Northern Ireland but not in Wales, which has its own framework for end-of-life care and support. A Scottish Government spokeswoman told the BBC it welcomed the Neuberger review. \"Recommendations set out in the report will be considered by the Living and Dying Well National Advisory Group, so that any learning for Scotland can be taken forward with stakeholders,\" the spokeswoman said. The review for England was asked to focus on the use of the LCP model rather than re-evaluating its basic merits. But the DoH said the review team, which heard evidence from patients, families and health professionals, encountered \"numerous examples of poor implementation and worrying standards in care.\" The review was likely to conclude the LCP needed to be replaced, it said in a statement. \"The independent review into end of life care system the Liverpool Care Pathway, commissioned last year by Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb and backed by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is likely to recommend that the LCP is phased out over the next six to 12 months,\" the DoH said. The statement gave no indication of what might replace the LCP. But Mr Lamb said: \"We need a new system of better end-of-life care tailored to the needs of individual patients and involving their families.\" He ordered the review in November last year amid intense media scrutiny of the LCP following criticism from patients' families. At the time, he said he was concerned about the \"unacceptable\" cases that had come to light. British Medical Association president elect Baroness Finlay said the LCP was originally brought in because patients were \"dying badly, in hospitals in particular.\" They were being \"walked past, ignored and neglected,\" she said, and the LCP was an attempt to \"roll out the best of hospice care into other areas.\" \"By and large that worked well but the problem has been that it hasn't always been used properly,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. She said that if the LCP was phased out it was vital something better replaced it. \"Something which is very clear, very simple and which drives up professional behaviour,\" Baroness Finlay added. Dr Linda Patterson, clinical vice-president of the Royal College of Physicians - which has been reviewing the LCP every year since it was introduced in 2004 - said the system was \"very helpful.\" \"But if the execution of it in all instances has not been right then we need to review that,\" she added. \"All doctors dealing with patients who may unfortunately die need to be trained in end-of-life care. We need to know what the standards are, we need to be able to apply them, our junior doctors and trainees need to be fully trained in it. And we also need time - time to be able to discuss these very difficult issues.\" Jason Suckley, director of policy and campaigns at Sue Ryder, said the healthcare charity's research had shown the timing and quality of conversations health professionals had with terminally-ill patients amounted to a \"lottery.\" He said workers' communication skills needed to be improved and urged Health Education England, which provides training and support for healthcare professionals, to include end-of-life training in its workforce mandate. \"When it comes to dying we cannot afford to get it wrong and health professionals need to be supported to communicate with people effectively at a very traumatic and emotionally difficult time,\" he said.

{"original_text": "Wallace's name might not have the same cachet as Keegan, Dalglish or Rush but his place in Liverpool history is unassailable - he scored the club's first European goal. His landmark moment came in Iceland when he opened the scoring in a 5-0 win over K.R. Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur in 1964. \"The great Roger Hunt went to the by-line, squared it back to me and from all of those six yards out I powered it in,\" said Wallace who was only playing because Ian St John was ill. It's more than 55 years since he left Llanelli for Liverpool, but Wallace has not lost a trace of his Welsh accent. So how did the son of a Scotland international claim his place in footballing history? And why does he have a south Wales lilt when he speaks? It's a story that takes in one of Wales' most famous rugby academies and Huddersfield Town. Wallace, now 71, recalls it all with fondness. Wallace was five years old when his father, former Scotland centre forward Dougie Wallace, was appointed player-manager at Llanelli AFC. As a teenager he went to Gwendraeth School, where Barry John - nicknamed The King - and before him Carwyn James took their first steps to rugby stardom. \"The school was rugby orientated. Barry was two years younger than me and even then I used to love to watch him play,\" Wallace told BBC Wales. \"But my childhood dream was to become a footballer. I wanted to be just like my dad.\" Wallace played in the Llanelli junior league between the ages of 11 to 14, before playing for Glan Morfa where his talent was discovered. \"It was late October 1959. I remember it well,\" he says of the day Bill Shankly's scout spotted him. \"There's somebody I want you to have a look at\" was the message sent back to Shankly, then manager of Huddersfield Town. Wallace had trials with the Terriers and when Shankly went to Liverpool, he took Wallace with him. \"At the end of my third trial at Huddersfield, Bill Shankly signed on the Monday to become manager of Liverpool Football Club,\" Wallace continued. After Liverpool won the Division One title in 1963-64, they were offered automatic qualification for the European Cup for the first time. \"Liverpool in the 60s was vibrant - The Beatles, 50,000 in the stadium, 28,000 in the Kop swaying to their songs. I remember it like yesterday,\" Wallace said. \"I wasn't always on the pitch but I was always part of the party. We had a fabulous squad. Ronnie Yates, Ian Callaghan, Roger Hunt, Ian St John. An odd person might get injured so you might get a game now and then.\" And it was sickness that gave Wallace his break when fellow Scot St John had suffered appendicitis a few weeks before Liverpool's first European tie in Iceland. Wallace recalls the journey was as memorable as the game, \"Back then you couldn't get a direct flight to Iceland.

His landmark moment came in iceland when he opened the scoring in a 5-0 win over K. r. Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur in 1964. `` The great Roger Hunt went to the by-line , squared it backwards to me and from all of those six yards out I powered it in , '' said Wallace who was only playing because Ian St John was ill. It 's more than 55 years since he left Llanelli for Liverpool , but Wallace has not turn a loss a trace of his Welsh accent. So how did the son of a Scotland international claim his place in footballing history ? And why does he have a south Wales lilt when he speaks ? It 's a story that takes in one of Wales ' most famous rugby academies and Huddersfield townspeople. Wallace , straightaway 71 , recalls it all with fondness. Wallace be five years old when his father , former Scotland centre forward Dougie Wallace , be appointed player-manager at Llanelli AFC. As a teenager he went to Gwendraeth School , where Barry John - nickname The King - and before him Carwyn James took their first steps to rugby stardom. `` The shoal was rugby orientated. Barry was two years younger than me and even then I used to love to watch him take on , '' Wallace told BBC Wales. `` But my childhood dream was to become a football player. I wanted to be just like my dada. `` Wallace played in the Llanelli junior league between the ages of 11 to 14 , before playing for Glan Morfa where his endowment was discovered. `` It was recent October 1959. I remember it well , '' he says of the day Bill Shankly 's scout make out him. `` There 's somebody I need you to have a look at '' was the message sent back to Shankly , then manager of Huddersfield Town. Wallace had trials with the Terriers and when Shankly went to Liverpool , he accept Wallace with him. `` At the end of my third trial at Huddersfield , Bill Shankly sign on the Monday to become manager of Liverpool Football Club , '' Wallace continued. After Liverpool won the Division One title in 1963-64 , they were offered automatic making for the European Cup for the first time. `` Liverpool in the 60s personify vibrant - The Beatles , 50,000 in the stadium , 28,000 in the Kop swaying to their songs. I remember it like yesterday , '' Wallace state. `` I was n't forever on the pitch but I was forever part of the party. We had a fabulous police squad. Ronnie Yates , Ian Callaghan , Roger Hunt , Ian St toilet. An odd individual might get injured so you might get a game now and then. `` And it was sickness that hand Wallace his break when fellow Scot St John had suffered appendicitis a few weeks before Liverpool 's first European tie in Iceland. Wallace recalls the journey was as memorable as the game , `` backwards then you could n't get a direct flight to Iceland. We flew to Glasgow with a six-hour wait , Shankly ] did n't want us lounging around so off we went on a bus to a holiday summer camp. I 'll forever remember the fella stopping us at the gate. `` The boss went over and state , ' I 'm Bill Shankly , I 'm going to Reykjavik in Iceland and this is Liverpool Football Club '. The hombre replied , 'Well you 're on the wrong road , Mr Shankly , You should have taken a right back that way '. `` Wallace and the team got through the gate , onto the flight for Iceland , and a lilliputian piece of history followed. `` The goal came after three minutes , '' recalls wallace , `` It had n't dawned on me it was the first-ever goal in Europe until about six months later when someone mentioned it would be a good quiz question. `` He also played a stellar part in another landmark game , scoring twice in a 3-2 win over Arsenal - a game televised by the BBC on the first Match of the Day.

People catch these worms from bites from infected insects such as flies or mosquitoes. Left untreated, the worms grow and multiply, causing disabling symptoms in their host. The drug ivermectin kills the first larval stage of the parasite - the babies of adult female worms. William C Campbell discovered this by studying bacteria living in soil samples obtained by Satoshi Omura from a Japanese golf course in Ito City, in the Shizuoka region.

Before a cancer spreads it is easier to contain and cure, afterwards it is incredibly difficult. The tumour itself has to evolve so bits of it are able to break free, survive travelling in the blood stream and invade new tissues. A deeper understanding of how this happens could lead to new ideas for treatment. The mice were injected with cancerous tissue engineered to fluoresce. The researchers then let the disease progress before using chemicals that made the mouse's body and internal organs highly transparent. It meant the body could be rapidly imaged and the location of any cancerous tissue detected. The study, published in the journal Cell Reports, details cancers growing in the lungs, intestines, and liver before spreading around the body.

It meant the body could constitute rapidly imaged and the location of any cancerous tissue detected. The study , published in the journal Cell Reports , details cancers uprise in the lungs , intestines , and liver before spreading around the body. Dr Hiroki Ueda , one of the researchers , said : `` The images reveal cancerous colonies in adequate detail to calculate their shapes , volumes , and distributions - characteristics critical to distinguishing between patterns of metastasis. He told the BBC news show website : `` We are now applying this technology to the human clinical samples. `` I hope this tissue-clearing and 3D imaging of human samples will make diagnosis easier , more nonsubjective and accurate in near future. `` Watch an infection take hold in 3D and in real time Further experimentation showed how cancer can get better at spreading. Dr Kohei Miyazono said : `` Most of the cancer cells appear to break during circulation in the bloodstream and fail to metastasise. `` But cancers then take up producing chemical signals to help them grow. The researchers tested the effect of one of them , called TGF-beta , and showed it dramatically meliorate the chances of cancers colonising the lung tissue.

{"original_text": "The decision of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to leave rates at their new, historically low, level was no surprise. Last month the Bank halved its bank rate from 0.5 as it tried to ensure the stability of the UK's banking system in the aftermath of the June Brexit referendum vote. That was the first rate cut since 2009. But the Bank said again that it might cut rates further in the coming months, even though the immediate economic after-shock of the Brexit vote now appears to be weaker than first thought. \"A number of indicators of near-term economic activity have been somewhat stronger than expected,\" the Bank said in the minutes of its latest MPC meeting. It added that if its economic forecasts in November were similar to those it had formulated in August, then \"a majority of members expected to support a further cut in bank rate to its effective lower bound at one of the MPC's forthcoming meetings during the course of the year.\" The Bank noted that a variety of economic indicators have suggested that the UK economy has shrugged off the post-referendum surprise in the short-term. As a result, the Bank is not as gloomy about the short-term state of the economy as it was a month ago. But it said that it still expects the pace of economic activity in the July-September period to have halved from the growth rate recorded earlier in the year. The Bank's internal judgement is that growth in Q3 (that's July to September) will now be between 0.2 and 0.3, a pretty chunky upgrade on its August forecast of 0.1. It's not an official forecast, but given the Q3 growth figure will be announced before the next meeting of the MPC in November, it is as close as we are going to get. Looking at 2017, the MPC says it is harder to make a judgement, but if the present economic momentum continues, then expect an upgrade in growth forecasts for next year and 2018 after brutal downgrades last month.

The proposals would see the average band E household pay about PS2 per week more, and the average household in the highest band (H) about PS10 a week more.

Opposition members have accused the government of \"tinkering\" with the system rather than making bold reforms. The Scottish Conservatives support an end to the council tax freeze and increases to the top two bands, but oppose the changes to bands E and F.

Mr Wightman had also call off for a revaluation of council tax bands during the committee debate , pointing out that the current bands were based on property values dating back to 1991. The Green MSP said he had a constituent whose flat be in band E , but be worth PS20,000 less than neighbouring flats in band B. Labour 's Elaine captain john smith pointed out that some council tax payers were n't even born when the council tax values of their properties were determined. Mr Mackay said a `` costly '' revaluation would `` strike time '' and could be a `` shock '' to many households - with some potentially facing `` astronomically high '' tax increases under a full revaluation. But he said the changes to bands were `` not the end of the story in terms of local tax [ reform ] , '' saying the government was taking a `` balanced approach '' while seeking to `` make council tax more reform minded. `` The Scottish government has started the process of reforming local taxation following on from the Commission on local Tax Reform , which called for a fairer , more transparent and progressive tax to fund local services. Opposition members have accused the government of `` muck around '' with the system rather than making bold reforms. The Scottish Conservatives support an end to the council tax freeze and increases to the top two bands , but oppose the changes to bands einsteinium and F. But Labour and the Greens both want to see the `` hated '' council tax scrapped , with Labour repeatedly incriminate the SNP of abandoning an earlier promise to do so. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "At least 1.8 million more households will be looking to rent rather than buy a home by 2025, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) claims. It has called on the government to offer tax breaks to encourage building and investment in the sector. The Conservative Party has indicated its focus remains on home ownership. The number of UK households renting property rose from 2.3 million in 2001 to 5.4 million in 2014, according to Rics. It said that any further investment in property by landlords had been hit by changes to stamp duty in April. Anyone buying a home that is not their main residence must now pay a 3 stamp duty surcharge. In Scotland, the equivalent tax - the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) - was also up-rated. This led to a spike in property purchases in March, with transactions falling quickly again thereafter. Next year, landlords are likely to be hit again when their right to deduct their mortgage interest from their income tax bill is removed. Rics suggests that the stamp duty increase should be reversed, a move which would infuriate potential first-time buyers - many of whom say they are regularly outbid by buy-to-let investors. Generation Rent, a group that campaigns for better conditions for tenants, said the higher rate of stamp duty was a good thing. \"It does give first-time buyers a much-needed advantage against people who are simply betting that house prices will keep going up,\" said Dan Wilson Craw, the policy manager of Generation Rent. \"In the first three months of the surcharge, the tax on second homes raised PS424m - that cash could help build new homes for people on low incomes.\" A body that represents landlords said that rents were likely to rise. \"Tenants will be hurt most, as landlords recover the stamp duty increase by charging tenants more,\" said David Cox, the managing director of the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA). \"The simple answer is that we need to build more homes.\" In addition to a reversal in the stamp duty increase, Rics also called for: Rics' call comes just a day after Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the government would take \"unprecedented steps\" to encourage construction of homes for people to buy. He told the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham that the housing shortage was \"a huge issue for our country\" and would be his \"number-one priority.\" He said: \"Far too many young people cannot get a foot on the housing ladder. Many are being forced to live back with mum and dad as rents soar faster than wages.\" Among the plans announced was an Accelerated Construction scheme, using PS2bn of new public sector borrowing to make public land with outline planning permission available to builders.

Next year , landlords are likely to be hit again when their right to deduct their mortgage interest from their income tax bill embody removed. Rics suggest that the stamp duty increase should be reversed , a move which would infuriate potential first-time buyers - many of whom say they are regularly outbid by buy-to-let investors. Generation Rent , a group that campaigns for better conditions for tenants , said the high rate of stamp duty was a good thing. `` It does give first-time buyers a much-needed advantage against people who are simply betting that house prices will keep going up , '' said Dan Wilson Craw , the policy coach of Generation Rent. `` In the first three months of the surcharge , the tax on second menage raised PS424m - that cash could help build new menage for people on low incomes. `` A body that map landlords said that rents were likely to rise. `` Tenants will be wound most , as landlords recover the stamp duty increase by charging tenants more , '' said David Cox , the managing director of the Association of Residential Letting Agents ( ARLA ). `` The mere answer is that we need to build more homes. `` In addition to a reversal in the stamp duty increase , Rics also called for : Rics ' shout comes just a day after Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the government would take `` unprecedented steps '' to encourage construction of homes for people to buy. He told the Conservative party conference in Birmingham that the housing shortage was `` a huge issue for our country '' and would be his `` number-one priority. `` He said : `` Far too many young people dismiss not get a foot on the housing ladder. Many are exist forced to live back with mum and dad as rents soar faster than wages. `` Among the plans announced was an Accelerated Construction scheme , using PS2bn of new public sphere borrowing to make public land with outline planning permission available to builders.

{"original_text": "Its reach has also expanded across the Sahel region south of the Sahara Desert, attracting members from Mauritania, Morocco, Niger and Senegal as well as from within Mali where, in alliance with other Islamists, it is fighting French troops on the ground. During the Mali crisis, its fighters have dramatically increased their profile, allowing them to further their aim of spreading Islamic law and jihad across West Africa. AQIM's influence over other nascent Islamist cells comes from its wealth: it is one of the region's best-armed groups thanks to the money it makes from kidnapping Westerners and drug and cigarette trafficking across the Sahara. It emerged in early 2007, after a feared militant group, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), aligned itself with Osama Bin Laden's international network. Back in the 1990s, against a background of Islamist political groups testing their strength across North Africa, the military-backed authorities in Algeria at first permitted the Islamists to play a full part in the nation's political life. But then, when the Islamic Salvation Front was poised to sweep the board in a 1992 general election, they annulled the whole process and took power back. The political ferment immediately moved into violence. Armed Islamists mounted attacks across Algeria, the security forces fought back; and sometimes it was hard to tell which group had carried out which atrocity. Other states in the region - Tunisia and Morocco, Mauritania to the west and Libya to the east - also battled against Islamists. But the conflict in Algeria was particularly brutal, killing perhaps 150,000 people. It peaked in the 1990s, until an amnesty offer to Islamists in 1999 led to gradual improvements. Violence fell and the country's economy recovered during the early years of the 21st Century. However, the most feared of the militant organisations, the Armed Islamic Group or GIA, rejected the promised amnesty and continued a violent campaign to establish an Islamic state. By then it had split, with the most extreme faction calling itself the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat - a name which echoed an Islamist group in Morocco. The Arabic word \"Salafist\" means fundamentalist, in the sense of going back to the original texts of Islam. In September 2006 the GSPC said it had joined forces with al-Qaeda, and in January 2007 it announced that it had changed its name to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb to reflect its new allegiance. At the time there had been much debate in intelligence circles about the significance of the move. Some officials dismissed it as an act of desperation by a group on its last legs, seeking to attract new recruits by aligning itself with Osama Bin Laden. Others, who saw it as far more worrying development, proved correct, as al-Qaeda has succeeded in persuading North Africa's Islamist extremists to take a more global view. In fact, the head of the US Africa Command said he believed that in 2012 AQIM, Nigeria's Boko Haram and the Somali Islamist group al-Shabab were co-ordinating their efforts. The merger announcement delighted al-Qaeda's then deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who described it at the time as \"a source of chagrin, frustration and sadness\" for Algeria's authorities. Shortly afterwards, seven bombs exploded in Algeria's eastern Kabylia region, killing six people, and in April 2007 at least 30 people were killed in bomb attacks on official buildings in Algiers. AQIM said it had planted the bombs. More attacks followed: on buses carrying foreign oil workers; on American diplomats; on soldiers; and in September 2007, a suicide bomb attack in Batna, aimed at the motorcade of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The president was not injured, but 20 people were killed. Two days later, a car bomb killed more than 30 people at a coastguard barracks in the town of Dellys. In December, twin car bombs claimed by AQIM killed at least 37 people in Algiers, including 17 UN staff. The death toll continued to mount in 2008. Back-to-back attacks on 19 and 20 August killed dozens of people. The first was a suicide car bombing at a police college in Issers, east of Algiers, killing 48 people. A day later, two more car bombings struck in quick succession in Bouira, south-east of Algiers. The second explosion in Bouira killed 12 Algerian employees of the Canadian engineering firm SNC-Lavalin. The attacks continued into 2009, when suspected al-Qaeda militants in February killed nine security guards who were working for the state-owned gas and electricity distributor Sonelgaz at a camp near Jijel, east of Algiers. Algerian Islamists represent the largest national grouping in al-Qaeda, according to Jill Carroll's 2007 briefing paper How Did Al-Qaeda Emerge in North Africa? Abdelaziz Belkhadem, Algeria's prime minister in 2007, warned that the bombers wanted to take the North African country back to \"the years of hardship.\" But other incidents across the Maghreb pointed to the group's regional ambitions. In January that year, 12 people were shot dead by the security forces in Tunisia near the small town of Solimane, south of the capital, Tunis. The authorities initially described their adversaries as criminals but later admitted that the men were Islamist militants with connections to the GSPC. Meanwhile, Morocco's security forces clamped down on several militant cells - arresting, trying and jailing their leaders - after four incidents blamed on al-Qaeda-inspired groups in 2007. The security forces were said to be on the lookout for militants who were believed to be crossing into Morocco from Algeria. And of course the Madrid train bombs, which killed almost 200 people in 2004, were the work of a Moroccan gang. In December 2008, AQIM militants abducted the United Nations special envoy, Robert Fowler, and his assistant, Louis Guay, near Niger's capital, Niamey. They were released in April 2009. The group also seized four European tourists who disappeared in January 2009 along the Mali-Niger border. Two were freed in April. The group threatened to kill one of the remaining pair - a Briton - unless a radical Islamic cleric convicted of terrorism in Jordan, Abu Qatada, was released from jail in the UK. And in June 2009 the British government said it believed AQIM's claims on an Islamist website that the death threat had been carried out against the British captive, Edwin Dyer. In July 2010 AQIM said it had killed French hostage Michel Germaneau - kidnapped in northern Niger three months earlier and transferred to Mali - in revenge for the killing of seven comrades in a failed rescue raid. In November 2011 a German was killed and three other foreigners kidnapped by AQIM in the ancient tourist city of Timbuktu in northern Mali. The group is thought to have between 600 and 800 fighters spread throughout Algeria and Europe - and according to the independent think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, most of its major commanders trained in Afghanistan. Since 2004, the leader of the militants is thought to be Abou Mossab Abdelwadoud, a former university science student and infamous bomb-maker. In 2005, deputy GSPC leader Amari Saifi was sentenced to life in prison by an Algiers court for kidnapping 32 European tourists in 2003. The former paratrooper was captured by Chadian rebels in mysterious circumstances and passed on to Libya before standing trial in Algeria. Another leading member was Mokhtar Belmokhtar, known as \"The One-Eyed,\" a former soldier and infamous cigarette smuggler at the centre of the 2013 hostage drama in Algeria.

{"original_text": "Media playback is not supported on this device Set 136 to win, Pakistan reached their target inside 15 overs, with Sharjeel Khan (59) and Khalid Latif (59 not out) sharing an opening stand of 107. It is England's joint-second biggest T20 defeat in terms of balls remaining and the third time they have lost by nine wickets. The home side earlier limped to 135-7, losing six wickets for 54 runs, and at one stage went more than seven overs without finding the boundary. This was a disappointing night at the end of an otherwise successful limited-overs summer for England, one in which they have won one-day series against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, as well as the only T20 against the former. Here, on an ideal batting surface, they could not get on top of a Pakistan attack whose four pace bowlers cleverly varied their length and pace, along with left-arm spinner Imad Wasim, who did not concede a boundary. Then the dazzling strokeplay of Sharjeel and Latif delighted a packed, partisan and deafening Old Trafford, ending Pakistan's tour on a considerable high. Defending a modest total, England needed everything to go their way in the field. Instead they were hit by a storm of boundaries from Sharjeel and Latif. Whereas England struggled to find the fence - they hit only 10 fours and one six - Pakistan's first 36 runs came exclusively in fours, in the space of four overs. Left-hander Sharjeel and his right-handed partner Latif took advantage as England too often dropped short, with captain Eoin Morgan forced to turn to Joe Root's occasional off-spin inside the powerplay. When Morgan called on his frontline spinners, Sharjeel twice lofted Adil Rashid over the mid-wicket fence to reach a 30-ball half-century. Rashid at least had Sharjeel sky to Moeen Ali at cover, then had a stumping chance missed by Jos Buttler to reprieve Babar Azam. But by then, the result was not in doubt, Latif clubbing Moeen over cow corner to complete his half-century in 36 balls and Babar hitting Liam Plunkett for four to seal the win. England's problems began long before then, in a batting effort that was stifled by the accuracy, variation and execution of Pakistan's five bowlers. Alex Hales and Jason Roy added 56 for the first wicket but, after Roy was given lbw reverse-sweeping the brilliant Imad for 21, England slipped to 110-6. Hales was bowled by Imad for 37 before the quartet of pacemen, three of whom are left-armers, took over. Using changes of pace, Hasan Ali had Joe Root and Ben Stokes caught at third man and deep square leg respectively, while the excellent Wahab Riaz had Morgan edge behind and Buttler slap to deep point. In all of this, England went from the end of the 10th over to midway through the 18th without finding the rope. When David Willey finally hit Sohail Tanvir to the mid-wicket fence, it was the only boundary England hit in the second half of their innings. England captain Eoin Morgan on BBC Test Match Special: \"Probably the last two overs of our innings and the first three of Pakistan's, the conditions really did change. We got it wrong with the toss. \"Pakistan bowled really well and we were about 15 short on the wicket we batted on. On the wicket we bowled on, we would have needed 185.\" England coach Trevor Bayliss on Sky Sports: \"The game was all about momentum. The way we were going allowed Pakistan to get on top.

{"original_text": "The three judges scored the 12-round bout 115-112 to Burns, 115-113 to Beltran and 114-114, which did not seem to reflect Beltran flooring Burns or his dislocating the champion's jaw. Brave Burns was constantly pushed back and landed heavily on occasion. And his courage was rewarded, controversially, when he retained his belt. Burns's preparations were unlike any of his 38 previous fights. His wife had given birth to their first child, his son Leon's safe arrival coming only nine days ago after a four-day labour. The question troubling his fans was what state of mind would he be in to face a challenger known for being a regular sparring partner of the legendary Manny Pacquiao? The opening blows were fairly evenly shared, both fighters lively and aggressive, while in the second round Beltran had the champion pinned on the ropes for a spell, though Burns managed to take most of the Mexican's artillery on his arms. Burns promised he had learned from, principally in the way he had over-stretched to land blows on his reclining opponent, only to be caught on the counter. His exertions in the third round, though, suggested he was still trying to blow the challenger away and he was caught several times with Beltran's left hook before using his jab to good effect. Beltran stepped up the pace in the fourth and had Burns reeling from two crunching lefts, the second wobbling the 30-year-old from Coatbridge. The challenger, two years Burns's senior, was controlling the ring and he had the best of the exchanges in round five, though Burns, often on the back foot, had cleared his head and was occasionally getting through the Arizona-based fighter's guard. Burns continued to use the counter-attack, more out of necessity than choice, to inflict pain on Beltran. His reward was to land two excellent shots to Beltran's head in the closing stages of the sixth. The home fighter's recovery continued into the seventh as he made good use of a quick left jab, right-cross combination. But in the eighth round the champion was floored for the first time in three years with a sickening left hook to the head. Burns took the count of eight to gather his senses and to his credit had the guts to hang in there and land a peach of a left hook on Beltran's chin. Worryingly for Burns's camp, the challenger did not flinch. The Scot's refusal to panic paid dividends in his bout against Gonzalez, when his opponent retired injured after nine rounds. Similarly, he kept calm in this bout despite that knockdown and the pain in his jaw and gave his all in rounds nine and 10, without truly disrupting the forward momentum of Beltran. The crowd feared that Burns might need a knockout in the final two rounds to retain his belt but the technical and tactical nous of Beltran made this seem a forlorn wish. Again and again, the fans witnessed the wonderfully composed Mexican break Burns's increasingly erratic defences without risking a knockout blow himself. The final round signalled more of the same, sporadic bursts by Burns merely interrupting the hail of leather-clad fists. But when the MC announced a draw, Beltran sharply exited the ring while the home fans, though proud of their brave champion, squirmed at the result. On the undercard, Edinburgh's Stephen Simmons lifted the WBC international cruiserweight silver championship title with a deserved unanimous points win over Germany's David Graf, though the Scot suffered a nasty cut under his left eye in the fifth round. Scott Cardle, from Lytham St Annes, with plenty of home support from the Glaswegian side of his family, beat Fishburn's Gary Fox, taking a 79-73 points decision in their lightweight contest.

The government said it was attracting \"the best and brightest\" to teaching. Teachers' pay increases have been limited to 1 or less for the past five years, and the government aims to keep to this limit for the next four years. With long, hard working hours and a relatively low starting salary for a graduate, it is hardly surprising that teacher recruitment is struggling. Qualified teachers in England can expect to start on PS22,000 outside London or PS27,000 in inner London. In most cases, this is after post-graduate training, a year's school placement and a degree course. And although there is room for growth and progression - based on performance of course - many newly-qualified teachers find the pressures of the job too much and leave soon after taking their first post. Teachers in England have some of the longest hours and largest classes in the developed world, says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

In October, England's education secretary, Nicky Morgan, wrote to the STRB to remind them of this policy.

This means more children will be taught by teachers who are not specialist in the subjects they teach, it adds.

{"original_text": "The projection from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows a far-reaching shift in the balance of graduate numbers, with the rising Asian economies accelerating ahead of the United States and western Europe. The forecasts for the shape of the \"global talent pool\" in 2020 show China as rapidly expanding its graduate numbers - set to account for 29 of the world's graduates aged between 25 and 34. The biggest faller is going to be the United States - down to 11 - and for the first time pushed into third place, behind India. The US and the countries of the European Union combined are expected to account for little more than a quarter of young graduates. Russia is also set to decline - its share of the world's graduates almost falling by half since the beginning of the century. Indonesia, according to the OECD's projections, will rise into fifth place. Is this an end-of-empire moment? Higher education has become the mirror and magnifier of economic performance - and in the post-World-War-II era, universities in the US, western Europe, Japan and Russia have dominated. The US in particular has been the university superpower - in wealth, influence and until recently in raw numbers. Up until 2000, the US still had a share of young graduates similar to China. And Japan had as big a proportion of young graduates as India. Now China and India are the biggest players. Their rise in graduate numbers reflects their changing ambitions - wanting to compete against advanced economies for high-skill, high-income employment. Instead of offering low-cost manufacture, they are targeting the hi-tech professional jobs that have become the preserve of the Westernised middle classes. As the OECD figures show, this is not simply a case of countries such as China expanding while others stand still. Across the industrialised world, graduate numbers are increasing - just not as quickly as China, where they have risen fivefold in a decade. The OECD notes that by 2020, China's young graduate population will be about the same as the total US population between the ages of 25 and 64. This changing world map will see Brazil having a bigger share of graduates than Germany, Turkey more than Spain, Indonesia three times more than France. The UK is bucking the trend, projected to increase its share from 3 in 2010 to 4 in 2020. This push for more graduates has a clear economic purpose, says the OECD's analysis. Shifting from \"mass production to knowledge economy occupations\" means improved employment rates and earnings - so there are \"strong incentives\" for countries to expand higher education. But will there be enough graduate jobs to go round? The OECD has tried to analyse this by looking at one aspect of the jobs market - science and technology-related occupations. These jobs have grown rapidly - and the report suggests it is an example of how expanding higher education can generate new types of employment. These science and technology jobs - for professionals and technicians - account for about four in every 10 jobs in some Scandinavian and northern European countries, the OECD suggests. In contrast - and showing more of the old order - these technology jobs are only a small fraction of the workforce in China and India. The OECD concludes that there are substantial economic benefits from investing in higher education - creating new jobs for the better-educated as unskilled manufacturing jobs disappear. The OECD forecast reveals the pace of growth in graduate numbers. But it does not show the quality or how this expansion will translate into economic impact. There are other ways of mapping the changing distribution of knowledge. A team at the University of Oxford's Internet Institute has produced a set of maps showing the \"geography of the world's knowledge.\" This measures how populations are consuming and producing information in the online world - mapping the level of internet use, the amount of user-generated material in Google, concentrations of academic activity and the geographical focus of Wikipedia articles. And in contrast to the rise of the Asian economies, this tells a story of continuing Western cultural dominance. \"In raw numbers of undergraduates and PhDs, the Asian economies are racing ahead,\" says Prof Viktor Mayer-Schonberger, from the Oxford Internet Institute. \"But what's interesting is how the West persists in its positions of strength - because the West controls the institutions. \"There are more students in China than ever before - but they still use Western mechanisms to publish results, they accept the filters,\" says Prof Mayer-Schonberger. \"The big question will be whether the Chinese researchers can be as insightful as their Western counterparts - we don't know yet.\" The maps also reveal how much Africa and South America are losing out in this new scramble for digital power. Prof Mayer-Schonberger said he was \"completely shocked\" at the extent of the imbalance. Another feature of the Oxford study is to show how research bases and their spin-out economic activity are clustered into relatively small areas. In the US, says Prof Mayer-Schonberger, there is hugely disproportionate investment around Silicon Valley and the Boston area, with large tracts of \"wasteland\" between. \"Each era has its own distinct geography.

I don't see certainly at the moment, and I hope never, that the Taliban will be in a position where they can overthrow the elected government of Afghanistan.\" He said \"great effort\" has been put into training and mentoring the Afghan security forces. Sir Mike, who led the Army between 2003 and 2006 at the height of the UK's involvement in Afghanistan, added: \"Afghanistan is not a military problem per se, the root of it is political.

{"original_text": "United Nations officials rarely use the words \"genocide\" and \"ethnic cleansing,\" but they now say potentially both could envelop the world's youngest country. Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda. That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016. Every day, on average, another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines. Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia. A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres. The first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help. Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked him what they had left behind. \"They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,\" Mr Thomas told me. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun. \"They don't want us,\" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave. \"These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want... Nuer. They don't want them.\" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins.\"We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,\" he said. \"It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed.\" They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach. \"This has been unrelenting since July,\" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda. \"The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides.\" He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in. As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit. Girls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy, 16, stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem. \"War, war, war,\" she began, \"who are you and where do you come from?\" The confidence and resilience of her performance hiding deep trauma. \"You have killed my mother and father, even my brothers and sisters, leaving me to be called an orphan.\" There are so many terrible stories here of what South Sudan is doing to its own people.

{"original_text": "Cyber-attacks, trolls, terrorist propaganda, sexism, racism, Twitter mobs.... stop the web now, Mr Berners-Lee, we want to get off. So, when it came to compiling 2015's list of the most viral videos and memes (see 2012's, 2013's and 2014's), I decided to impose a couple of ground rules to keep things upbeat. Rule number one: nothing miserable. The world was a scary place in 2015. Consider this list a safe, feel-good haven. Rule number two: nothing in this list was created specifically to go viral. As in, a committee of advertising executives didn't sit around a room and decide how to spend money on making it a hit. Of course, everyone wants their posts to be popular, but let's just say this list is intended to feature some of the more organic fun. Off we go! One of the remarkable things about Ruairi McSorley is how he managed to change a tiny soundbite into a media career. Asked by UTV reporter Gareth Wilkinson about the weather conditions in Northern Ireland, McSorley's charming accent led to him being dubbed the most Irish man in the world. His \"frostbit\" soundbite has led to countless TV appearances, events and, soon, a charity single. If you're not a fan of American Football - and sometimes even if you are - the half-time show is the most interesting part of the sporting extravaganza. And not since Janet Jackson's wardrobe \"malfunction\" has their been a more talked about moment than singer Katy Perry's performance. She was joined on stage by two adorable backing dancers, although one of them, the shark on the left, struggled to keep up. Left Shark fever swept the world, coming to symbolise the daily struggles we all face to keep up with the world. Katy Perry's lawyers tried to trademark \"left shark,\" but were denied. Also in February, a garment now consigned to history as simply \"the dress\" was stirring debate. Optical illusion, colour blindness', strange lighting - whatever caused the difference of opinion, the image of the whitegold or blueblack dress became one of the most shared of the year. And then we all agreed it was blue and black. Didn't we? If Katy Perry's Left Shark was a symbol of life's daily struggles, the shot of a weasel hitching a ride on a woodpecker is a reminder of how we should all be able to get along, no matter our differences. \"Weasels are fearless,\" commented wildlife expert Lucy Cooke. Evidently! Also in March, shocking footage emerged from Thailand showing an elephant, clearly intoxicated, clambering into a bath. Did I say intoxicated? I meant adorable. Annual sense-of-humour-vacuum April Fools' Day brings a flood of prank videos. Most are terrible, but some are beautifully executed - like this magic from a maths teacher in California. It racked up an impressive 13 million views. Maths was a continuing theme in April. This brain teaser, originally posed to Singaporean schoolchildren, had the world scratching its head and arguing over the solution. Did you figure it out? (The answer's on Wikipedia...) \"Spotted this specimen trying to dance the other week. He stopped when he saw us laughing.\" So wrote a poster on 4chan, the notoriously dark online message board. They attached a picture of Sean O'Brien, a large Liverpudlian, who had been dancing at a gig. After attention was brought to the apparent \"fat-shaming,\" the internet rallied round and Mr O'Brien was tracked down. In May, the Dancing Man had a huge party thrown for him in Los Angeles - attended by Monica Lewinsky, Moby and Andrew WK. \"I'm still pinching myself,\" Mr O'Brien said. Back in London, it was a \"hipster cop\" that had people talking. Peter Swinger - who sports a stylish, curly moustache - was spotted on duty at a protest march. However, according to the Daily Mail, a close relative said Mr Singer, a father of three, was \"definitely not a hipster.\" What a hipster thing to say. Behold, the best double-take ever captured on film. Champion surfer Mick Fanning waiting just six days to get back into the water after this terrifying incident. The 34-year-old was competing in South Africa when two sharks appeared in the water. No problem for Mr Fanning, though - he just punched one of them and swam off, avoiding probable death. Kevin Innes found a pile of dog toys in a shop in Norway. And then he pressed them. The Guardian called the resulting clip the \"best thing on the internet today.\" I'd go as far as declaring it the best thing on the internet this entire year. Why? It sums up the very best thing about viral hits - that ability to give the entire world that \"oh, you had to be there\" experience. Also in August, everyone melted after watching this little lad who definitely isn't going to miss his mum when he's at school. The undoubted star of this next clip is the woman in the passenger seat. Quiet, stoic... resigned. Next to her, the now world-famous Ronnie Pickering. Who? Ronnie Pickering. Who? RONNIE PICKERING! Mr Pickering's road rage was captured on film by cyclist Steve Middleton, and spread around the world as people asked: \"Who's Ronnie Pickering?\" The video can be viewed here, but be warned it contains a flood of swear words. Mr Pickering's son later took to Twitter to say his Dad's a great guy and a great laugh. So, let's give him the benefit of the doubt - we all have our off days. Meanwhile, in September, this Manhattan rat was having the \"on\" day to end them all. In this internet age, it's quite reassuring that the humble music video format still has the ability to get people talking. Though now, it's not enough to merely like a music video - you have to remix it. Hip hop artistdancing visionary Drake's video for Hotline Bling spawned hundreds of remakes. To save you the time, just watch this one - it's by far the best. For a short while in October it seemed that every cat owner in the world was buying up cucumbers to scare their cats. (Although it must be said that experts later advised against it - it's pretty mean.) There are numerous theories as to why cats seem to jump out of their skin at the sight of a cucumber - one expert, speaking to ABC News, said it's because cats are genetically wired to bounce away from snakes. Ever since the demise of CBBC's Record Breakers, the public's appetite for world-beaters has been left unsatisfied. Good job we've got Otto, then, a bulldog who rode a skateboard through the legs of 30 people. If there's one thing we've learned this year, it's that being Irish increases your viral potential by roughly 100x. Here, TV news reporter Teresa Mannion took to the coastline of Galway, in the west of Ireland, to broadcast to RTE viewers. But Storm Desmond had other ideas, giving poor Ms Mannion a right blustering. \"Don't swim in the sea!\" she screamed in her dramatic live report. And then the internet got to work. And on Christmas Day, a lot of Dads fell off their hoverboards. So, there we have it. An eclectic year of road rage, Irishness, dresses and sharks of varying ferocity. The next year could see big changes to the internet. Debates on encryption and censorship may alter the very fabric of how this series of tubes works. But through it all, let's hope we keep our sense of humour and not take ourselves too seriously. When life gives you cucumbers, make a video.

But Storm Desmond had other ideas , open poor Ms Mannion a right blustering. `` Do n't swim in the ocean ! '' she screamed in her dramatic live report. And then the cyberspace got to work. And on christmas Day , a lot of Dads fell off their hoverboards. So , there we deliver it. An eclectic year of road rage , Irishness , dresses and sharks of varying violence. The next year could see big variety to the internet. Debates on encryption and censorship may alter the very fabric of how this serial of tubes works. But through it all , lease 's hope we keep our sense of humour and not take ourselves too seriously. When life gives you cucumbers , seduce a video.

There will also be fears that the outstanding Sean O'Brien could be facing a citing after he appeared to punch France lock Pascal Pape in the opening minute of the contest. With O'Connell retiring from international duty after this tournament, there will be fears that his Ireland career could be over after 108 caps. The French, blunt as an attacking force for the most part, must regroup to face the All Blacks in their quarter-final at the Millennium Stadium next Saturday evening. Ireland showed remarkable resolve to stand up to a hugely physical France side. The French, as promised, targeted ex-Racing Metro player Sexton and the Ireland fly-half was forced off in the 25th minute after a heavy tackle by Louis Picamoles, although it looked as though the Irish playmaker injured his groin kicking the ball seconds earlier. O'Connell's international career may have come to an end after he fell awkwardly as he was cleared out at a ruck in first-half injury-time, while O'Mahony was forced off 14 minutes into the second half with another leg injury. However, that came five minutes after a break by the magnificent Robbie Henshaw helped set up Kearney's crucial try. Sexton's replacement Ian Madigan produced a tremendous display after his introduction as he conclusively won his battle with France fly-half Frederic Michalak. The Irish also managed to out-scrum the French, while the performances of second-half replacements Iain Henderson and Chris Henry demonstrated the depth in Joe Schmidt's squad. However, that depth may be tested to its limits next weekend against the Pumas. A huge early tackle from Jamie Heaslip on France full-back Scott Spedding set the tone for a bone-crunching contest. Media playback is not supported on this device Michalak and Spedding missed early chances to put France ahead but Sexton did nudge the Irish ahead from 45 metres after their first move into opposition territory. Two long-range Spedding penalties - either side of another Sexton three points - levelled the contest before the tearful Ireland fly-half was forced off. The composed Madigan's first action was to restore Ireland's lead in the 28th minute but the Irish suffered second devastating injury blow in first-half injury-time after Pascal Pape clattered into O'Connell at a ruck. Late in the half, Ireland centre Keith Earls had wasted a glorious try-scoring after to take a routine pass following a searing Tommy Bowe break. But the determined Irish were not to be denied after the break. Not for the first time in the contest, Henshaw charged past France's ineffective battering ram centre Mathieu Bastareaud to put Ireland on the offensive and the resultant scrum was finished off by full-back Kearney finish. After O'Mahony's departure, a penalty from France replacement Morgan Parra cut the Irish lead to 14-9 but the excellent Murray's 72nd-minute try sealed Ireland's remarkable victory after Rory Best's initial drive for the line. There were many man of the match contenders in the Ireland team but the Tullow Tank produced a titanic display in the most bruising of contests. The Ireland flanker made 19 carries in the contest and made as many metres in the game as impressive wing Tommy Bowe.

It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. On Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction. The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had \"ironclad information\" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and \"pushed hard\" for its passage. A US state department spokesman said the accusation was \"just not true,\" but he hoped the resolution would \"serve as a wake-up call\" for Israel. More than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements \"has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.\" Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister. The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot. But on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed. Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech. \"It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,\" he said. \"We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families.... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict.\" Mr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as \"misleading critiques\" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government.

{"original_text": "Galvani Bioelectronics hopes to bring a new treatment based on the technique before regulators within seven years. GlaxoSmithKline and Verily, formerly Google, Life Sciences, are behind it. Animal experiments have attached tiny silicone cuffs, containing electrodes, around a nerve and then used a power supply to control the nerve's messages. One set of tests suggested the approach could help treat type-2 diabetes, in which the body ignores the hormone insulin. They focused on a cluster of chemical sensors near the main artery in the neck that check levels of sugar and the hormone insulin. The sensors send their findings back to the brain, via a nerve, so the organ can coordinate the body's response to sugar in the bloodstream.

Social workers say they are under constant pressure because of media coverage and criticism of their role in high profile cases such as the death of Ayeeshia Jane Smith. Local authorities say social workers leave for better pay as agency staff. And the Department for Education (DFE) said it was investing PS100m to recruit graduates and professionals. There were 26,500 full time equivalent posts filled by children's social workers at the end of September 2015, 1,880 more than the year before. Yet a further 5,470 were vacant. The number of agency workers filling vacant posts was equivalent to more than double the total number of employed children's social workers in the North East. Official figures showed there were 4,400 new starters as children's social workers in English councils between September 2014 and September 2015. Over the same period, 4,200 people left.

The rise in vacancies \"is an unexpected increase\" and may be down to councils not having previously counted vacancies covered by agency workers. The figures show that Havering in east London saw the biggest percentage fall in the number of social workers, down from 86 to 50. It meant the borough went from one social worker for every 13 children in need to one for every 34. Tim Aldridge, head of children's services, said it had been happening to councils across England. \"This is for several reasons including the public sector pay freeze seeing only 1 increases since 2010, compared to the salaries on offer to agency workers in the range of PS30 an hour or more,\" he said. At Northamptonshire County Council, 50 of posts were being filled by agency workers. A spokesman said the figure had fallen since the statistics were compiled through a scheme to attract new social workers. \"We want to increase the number of permanent children's social workers but this will take time,\" he said.

At the same time, more families are struggling because of austerity and there have been cuts to preventative services, all of which adds further to the pressure and workload of a social worker.\" Claude Knights of the charity Kidscape said there had been \"avoidable child deaths\" because recommendations from serious case reviews were not being implemented. Calling for a government task force to address the challenges, she said: \"A great concern is that when the alarm bells are ringing loudly potentially life saving decisions are not made more swiftly.\" A Department for Education spokesman said: \"Excellent social workers help transform lives, which is why we are committed to recruiting and retaining the very best into the profession.

More than 40 new add-on apps have already been developed so far. But one expert said there was a risk Messenger would become bloated. Messenger has already proved controversial with some users of the social network, who have complained about having to switch between two apps to stay in touch with their Facebook friends. Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg announced the move at his firm's F8 developers conference in San Francisco. He said more than 600 million people already used Messenger at least once a month to express themselves, and that allowing other social networks and services to directly post to it would make \"conversations better.\" Among the new apps unveiled are ways to post: It builds on a move to allow US-based users to send money to and from each other via Messenger, which Facebook announced last week, and the earlier inclusion of Voip (voice over internet protocol) calls and stickers. Mr Zuckerberg also revealed plans to launch an associated service called Businesses on Messenger. Using the app instead of email, the public will be able to hold conversations with companies from which they buy goods, or have other interactions with. Facebook suggested this could include receiving delivery status updates, organising the return of an order and asking follow-up questions. The company is far from the first to attempt to turn a messaging app into a wider platform. China's WeChat service has gone even further by allowing its users to book taxis, pick cinema seats and find nearby restaurants among other actions. But one expert suggested Facebook should be cautious about the rate at which it adds further facilities to Messenger. \"There's a potential risk that they are going to overload Messenger with too many functions and none of them become that important - it really depends on how extensive they get with the features that they add over time,\" said Brian Blau from the Gartner tech consultancy. \"We have seen something like that happen with Facebook's Timeline, where you have all these different people competing for your attention. \"So, Facebook won't want to over-bloat, but it could enable all kinds of interesting scenarios where you can integrate messaging with other apps and services.\" Right now many of the Messenger apps look fun, if a bit gimmicky. But over time these new interactions will give Facebook another source of rich information about a user's interests - and thereby the potential to attract more ad revenue. Facebook would have taken inspiration from companies like China's WeChat and Japan's Line, which have proven successful in building both content and business services atop their core messenger offerings. But Messenger for Business is an ambitious plan. It is asking users to supplant more tried-and-tested means like email. Other communications behemoths like Skype tried - unsuccessfully - to become places to reinvent communications between businesses and their customers.

China 's WeChat service has gone even far by allowing its users to book taxis , pick cinema seats and find nearby restaurants among other actions. But one expert suggested Facebook should be conservative about the rate at which it adds further facilities to Messenger. `` There 's a potential risk that they are going to overload messenger with too many functions and none of them become that important - it really depends on how extensive they get with the features that they add over time , '' said Brian Blau from the Gartner tech consultancy. `` We have seen something like that happen with Facebook 's Timeline , where you have all these unlike people competing for your attention. `` So , Facebook wo n't want to over-bloat , but it could enable all kinds of interesting scenario where you can integrate messaging with other apps and services. `` Right now many of the messenger apps look fun , if a bit gimmicky. But over time these new interactions will give Facebook another source of rich information about a user 's interests - and thereby the potential to draw more ad revenue. Facebook would have taken inspiration from companies like China 's WeChat and Japan 's Line , which have proven successful in building both content and business military service atop their core messenger offerings. But Messenger for Business make up an ambitious plan. It comprise asking users to supplant more tried-and-tested means like email. Other communications behemoths like Skype tried - unsuccessfully - to become places to reinvent communications between businesses and their client. Will users be happy to shift their business interactions over to Facebook - a platform where , until now , they have been used to dealing primarily with quaker ?

It has gone to the brink of demolition and back but now its future finally looks secure. The mansion, designed by architect Walter Newall for a local solicitor, will now become a national centre for children's literature after raising PS5.3m in capital funding. It has been a dramatic journey very much in the spirit of author JM Barrie who studied at Dumfries Academy and played in Moat Brae's gardens as a child. Born in Kirriemuir in Angus, he moved south in 1873 at the age of 13. In his memoirs published in 1904, he wrote of Peter Pan: \"Our escapades in a certain Dumfries garden which was an enchanted land to me was certainly the genesis of this work.\" That was during Moat Brae's first life as a private home but, for many Doonhamers, it is best remembered in another role. Until the 1990s it was run as a private hospitalnursing home. However, when that operation was closed, the building at the back of Dumfries Academy faced an uncertain future. It sat empty for some time before eventually being sold at auction to a private buyer in late 2000. There were hopes that its fortunes could be transformed but talk of a grand hotel never came to fruition. Instead, the property remained empty and became a target for vandals as its sorry decline continued. In January 2003, furniture inside the building was set on fire, a number of windows and fittings smashed and plasterboard ripped from walls. It was estimated that it would cause PS200,000 to repair, prompting fresh calls for action to help safeguard its future. Yet there would be five more years of deterioration before the building was put up for sale once more. It was secured by the Loreburn Housing Association (LHA) in May 2008. They wanted to create a residential development as well as a visitor centre but not everyone approved of the proposed project. In August 2009, the Peter Pan Moat Brae Trust (PPMBT) served an interim interdict on LHA to stop their overhaul works which would have seen the facade retained but much of the rest of the building demolished. It came just days before the bulldozers were set to move in. Later that year the housing association agreed to sell the building to the trust for PS1. Convener Iain Agnew said it now felt the PPMBT was \"best placed\" to lead the restoration project. But that was just the start of another difficult voyage - raising the funds needed to convert the building into a centre for storytelling and children's literature.

{"original_text": "Three years ago, Swedish software consultancy Crisp decided that the answer was no. The firm, which has about 40 staff, had already trialled various organisational structures, including the more common practice of having a single leader running the company. Crisp then tried changing its chief executive annually, based on a staff vote, but eventually decided collectively that no boss was needed. Yassal Sundman, a developer at the firm, explains: \"We said,'what if we had nobody as our next CEO - what would that look like?' And then we went through an exercise and listed down the things that the CEO does.\" The staff decided that many of the chief executive's responsibilities overlapped with those of the board, while other roles could be shared among other employees. \"When we looked at it we had nothing left in the CEO column, and we said,'all right, why don't we try it out? says Ms Sundman. Crisp holds four-day meetings for all staff two to three times a year. They are used to making decisions on issues that affect everyone, such as an office move, but workers are encouraged to make decisions themselves at other times. It also still has a board - a legal requirement - and this can be used as a last resort to resolve issues if something is not working. Henrik Kniberg, an organisational coach at the firm, argues that not having to ask a boss for decisions on projects or budgets means the firm can respond faster. \"If you want to get something done, you stand up and start driving that,\" he says. Yet Mr Kniberg stresses that not having to ask permission does not remove the need for staff to discuss issues or bounce ideas off each other. Because they are all in charge, workers are more motivated, he argues. Crisp regularly measures staff satisfaction, and the average is about 4.1 out of five. The company is set up like a family, says Mr Kniberg. While nobody tells anyone exactly what to do, the unspoken understanding is that you don't mess up the house.

Ms Sundman says that is okay. \"At least you did the thing that was right in the moment - and then we can have a discussion about it. You can explain why it is that you thought this was a good way, and actually you might get everybody else to think the same way.\" Ultimately, the firm hopes that its way of working could inspire other companies to emulate the \"Crisp DNA.\" Although Crisp's move may seem radical, plenty of companies have trialled a similar arrangement. One of the best-known is online shoe and clothing retailer Zappos, which is owned by Amazon. In 2013 the firm adopted a new management structure called \"holacracy,\" which was intended to eliminate workplace hierarchy and foster collaboration. However, almost a fifth of Zappos staff subsequently departed, with chief executive Tony Hsieh admitting that \"self-management is not for everyone.\" While there is a growing trend for flatter organisational structures - meaning fewer middle managers and bosses - most of the more radical experiments are taking place in small start-ups. As well as employing fewer people, such firms do not have the long corporate history that can make major changes much more difficult to implement. Drew Houston, founder of online file-sharing service Dropbox, does not believe a leaderless structure can work in larger firms because it would be too chaotic. The main risk, he says, is that staff will encroach into each other's areas of responsibility, making them less efficient. \"Often infinite freedom like that can be pretty disorientating. It doesn't always feel good, because you no longer know what you're supposed to do, what's important and you're bumping up against other people,\" Mr Houston says. Similarly, Meg Whitman, chief executive of technology giant Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), firmly believes that companies need a leader. \"You've got to have the accountability, because if people in your organisation don't know what they're doing and how it affects the customers, then you've got a disconnect problem,\" she says.

The firm , which has about 40 staff , had already trialled various organisational structures , including the more common drill of having a single leader running the company. Crisp then test changing its chief executive annually , based on a staff vote , but eventually decided collectively that no boss was needed. Yassal Sundman , a developer at the firm , explains : `` We said , 'what if we had cipher as our next CEO - what would that look like ? ' And then we went through an exercise and listed down the things that the CEO does. `` The staff decided that many of the chief executive 's responsibility overlapped with those of the board , while other roles could be shared among other employees. `` When we looked at it we had nothing left in the CEO column , and we said , 'all right , why cause n't we try it out ? says Ms Sundman. Crisp holds four-day meetings for all staff two to three time a year. They are used to making decisions on issues that affect everyone , such as an government agency move , but workers are encouraged to make decisions themselves at other times. It also still has a board - a legal requirement - and this can be used as a last resort to resolve issues if something is not make for. Henrik Kniberg , an organisational coach at the firm , argues that not having to ask a party boss for decisions on projects or budgets means the firm can respond faster. `` If you want to get something done , you stand upward and start driving that , '' he says. Yet Mr Kniberg stresses that not having to ask permission does not remove the penury for staff to discuss issues or bounce ideas off each other. Because they are all in charge , workers are more motivated , he fence. Crisp regularly measures staff satisfaction , and the norm is about 4. 1 out of five. The company is set up like a menage , says Mr Kniberg. While nobody tells anyone exactly what to do , the unspoken understanding is that you do n't mess up the mansion. But what if the rest of the staff feel that one worker has made a terrible decision ? Ms Sundman say that is okay. `` At least you did the thing that was right in the moment - and then we can get a discussion about it.

{"original_text": "The industry group said sales of the fish leapt more than 50 by value - to PS186.7m - and 13 by volume. British food and drink exports as a whole grew by 8.3 year-on-year to PS4.9bn - the largest first quarter figure on record. FDF credited better promotion of UK goods abroad, and the weaker pound. Sterling has fallen by about 16 against the dollar since Britain voted to leave the EU last June, making UK produce more competitive overseas. Quoting UK government figures, the group said whisky had remained the top food and drink export during the period, with sales of PS895.9m. This was followed by Scottish salmon and chocolate. 2016, as a whole, was a record-breaking year for food and drink exports. That momentum appears to be continuing in 2017. This is good news for the industry and the government as it seeks new markets for British goods. Exports to non-EU countries have been growing at a faster rate than those to the EU for the last couple of years. A growth rate of 40 in South Korea is pretty impressive. But that still only amounts to some PS50m worth of business. Compare that to Ireland, where we generated some PS854m worth of exports in the first three months of this year. Ireland remains our most important trading partner by far when it comes to food and drink. Today's figures are yet more evidence that protecting this relationship post-Brexit will be key. The rise in the value of UK salmon sales is thanks in part to rising global demand for the fish, that has been hard to meet due to widespread lice infestations that have hampered production. That has led to higher prices for salmon across the board. The weakness of sterling has also helped to make Scottish salmon less expensive than salmon from Chile and Norway. British wine exports saw the greatest growth by volume, climbing 13.8, while the value of the UK's cheese exports jumped 29.1 to PS145.3m, thanks in part to a spike in sales to France. However, while the weaker pound benefited UK exporters, the FDF said it had also pushed up costs for British businesses that bring food into the UK from abroad.

However at 9.4, growth in exports to non-EU countries outpaced those to the EU, which climbed 7.4. Ian Wright, Director General of FDF, said it was \"pleasing to see non-EU exports performing beyond expectations.\" Food and drink sales to South Korea rose 40, driven by beer sales, while exports to South Africa grew 31 thanks to animal feed. However, Elsa Fairbanks, director of the Food Drink Exporters Association, another trade organisation, said: \"Ease of access to EU markets will continue to be vital to our industry in future as many food and drink products are not suited to export to distant markets. \"Although we recognise the need to explore new opportunities, leaving the EU should not mean ignoring those we already have.\"", "text_perturb": "The industriousness group said sales of the fish leapt more than 50 by value - to PS186. 7m - and 13 by intensity.

This embody good news for the industry and the government as it seeks new markets for British goods. Exports to non-EU countries have been growing at a faster rate than those to the EU for the last mates of years. A growth charge per unit of 40 in South Korea is pretty impressive. But that still only amounts to some PS50m charles frederick worth of business. Compare that to Ireland , where we generated some PS854m worth of exports in the first three months of this class. Ireland remains our most important trading partner by far when it comes to nutrient and drink. Today 's figures are up to now more evidence that protecting this relationship post-Brexit will be key. The rise in the value of UK salmon sales is thanks in part to rising global demand for the fish , that has been hard to meet due to widespread lice infestations that have hamper production. That has led to higher cost for salmon across the board. The weakness of sterling has also helped to make Scottish salmon less expensive than salmon from chilli and Norway. british wine exports saw the greatest growth by volume , climbing 13. 8 , while the time value of the UK 's cheese exports jumped 29. 1 to PS145. 3m , thanks in part to a spike in sales to jacques anatole francois thibault.

{"original_text": "In a town north of Paris, the two brothers suspected of carrying out the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine had been holed up at a printing warehouse. They have now been killed and their hostage freed. In Paris itself, a gunman holding hostages in a Jewish supermarket has been killed, but a number of hostages also died. Here is what we know about the attackers so far. Two brothers accused of carrying out the massacre at the Paris office of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday were killed two days later when police stormed the building where they had been holding a hostage. Two men, Said and Cherif Kouachi, had been barricaded in a printing factory in Dammartin-en-Goele, 35km (22 miles) from Paris. Cherif, 32, was jailed in 2008 and had long been known to police for militant Islamist activities, prior to the attack on Charlie Hebdo's offices, which killed 12 people. Cherif, who also went by the name Abu Issen, had been part of the \"Buttes-Chaumont network\" that helped send would-be jihadists to fight for al-Qaeda in Iraq after the US-UK invasion in 2003. He grew up in an orphanage in the western city of Rennes, where he trained as a fitness coach. In the early 2000s, he joined his elder brother at his home near Paris and worked as a pizza delivery man, media say. Police detained him in 2005 just as he was about to board a plane for Syria - at the time the gateway for jihadists hoping to fight US troops in Iraq. Le Monde reports that, following Cherif's imprisonment between January 2005 and October 2006, he first came into contact with the man who would become his mentor - Djamel Beghal. Beghal was sentenced to 10 years in prison in France in 2001 for his part in a plot to bomb the US embassy in Paris. In 2008, Cherif Kouachi was jailed for three years for his role in sending militants to Iraq, but 18 months of the sentence was suspended. Eric Bade, a neighbour living in Genneviliers, north-west of Paris, described Cherif as \"well-behaved, friendly, polite, clean-looking and above all, which is very important, he was willing to help old and disabled people.\" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bade said Cherif \"wasn't aggressive - he wasn't a crazy zealot, he was a calm person.\" 'Iraq connections' The brothers had allegedly attended a mosque near the Buttes-Chaumont, an area of northern Paris, where they came under the influence of a radical imam called Farid Benyettou. He reportedly encouraged them to study Islam at his home and at a Muslim centre in their area. A key figure in the Buttes-Chaumont network was Boubaker al-Hakim, a militant linked to al-Qaeda resistance against US forces in Iraq, a French expert on Islamists says. A French court jailed Hakim for seven years in 2008, at the same time as Cherif, along with Farid Benyettou, who got six years. That action broke up the jihadist network they had created. In a blog article (in French) Middle East expert Jean-Pierre Filiu says Hakim had recruited militants to fight in Falluja, an Iraqi city that became an al-Qaeda stronghold in 2004. Hakim is also wanted in Tunisia over the murder of two Tunisian left-wing opposition politicians in 2013 - Chokri Belaid and Mohamed Brahmi. Hakim claimed the murder in the name of the Islamic State militant group, Mr Filiu says. In 2010 Cherif Kouachi was named in connection with a plot to spring another Islamist, Smain Ait Ali Belkacem, from jail - a plot hatched by Beghal, according to French anti-terror police. Belkacem used to be in the outlawed Algerian Islamic Armed Group (GIA) and was jailed for life in 2002 for a Paris metro station bombing in 1995 which injured 30 people. Said Kouachi, 34, was also named in the Belkacem plot, but the brothers were not prosecuted because of a lack of evidence. Said's ID card was found in the brothers' getaway car which they abandoned after the Charlie Hebdo shooting, police sources say. The gunman who is thought to have killed four people and held a number of others hostage at a Jewish supermarket in eastern Paris has been identified as 32-year-old Amedy Coulibaly. Police also believe he killed a policewoman in the Montrouge area of the French capital on Thursday. Coulibaly is believed to have had a long history of criminal activity - including drugs offences - and links to at least one of the Kouachi brothers. Born in Juvisy-sur-Orge on the outskirts of Paris, he is said to have been one of 10 children. He worked for Coca Cola. He met then-President Nicolas Sarkozy at the Elysee Palace in 2009, as part of an employment initiative. In an interview with Le Parisien at the time, he said it would be \"impressive\" to meet Mr Sarkozy, and that he was not sure what he would say. He had added that his temporary job at the local Coca Cola plant would be over soon, and that he hoped Mr Sarkozy could help him get a job. Reports say Coulibaly - along with Cherif Kouachi - was a committed follower of Djamel Beghal.

But Leicester were given hope when Lucas inexplicably passed the ball to Jamie Vardy to shoot into an empty net. However, Adam Lallana sealed the win by firing a shot into the top corner and Firmino got a second from Mane's pass. Jurgen Klopp's Reds are up to seven points from four games, having played their first three matches on the road because of the expansion of Anfield's Main Stand. Meanwhile, Leicester remain on four points as they prepare for their Champions League debut against Club Brugge on Wednesday. Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet picked up blood injuries to his nose and then eye, but he lasted the 90 minutes with summer signing Loris Karius remaining on the bench. Liverpool, as has often been the case under Klopp, looked brilliant in stages, especially in the first 35 minutes when they could have been out of sight. Their opener was a good passing move, which ended in left-back Milner playing a great ball through to Firmino, who stepped inside Robert Huth to steer the ball into the bottom corner. The Foxes defence were again caught out by Jordan Henderson's ball forward for the second and Sturridge squared it with his heel for Mane to score on his home debut. But there will be cause for concern as Brazilian midfielder Lucas started at centre-back, with Mamadou Sakho not in the squad, and he let Leicester back into the game. He miscontrolled a simple pass from Mignolet and - under pressure and in a panic - played the ball across goal to Vardy, who just had to tap into an unguarded net. That gave Leicester hope and they could have had an equaliser when Robert Huth headed a Luis Hernandez long throw-in off the bar. Luckily for the Reds, they got their act together in the second half and Lallana scored his second goal in a week, after his England winner against Slovakia, to wrap up the win, from Georginio Wijnaldum's lay-off. And they added a late fourth when Kasper Schmeichel - who made seven saves in an otherwise good performance - came flying out of his goal with Mane rounding him and unselfishly passing to Firmino to steer the ball past several Leicester defenders.

Ranieri's side only had three shots on target, including the goal, with Vardy also forcing a save from Mignolet from Riyad Mahrez's ball forward.

He worked tirelessly to ensure money was raised and homes were found for the young refugees. Yet, amazingly, his self-effacing manner meant that it was 50 years before the full story of his heroic efforts became public knowledge. Nicholas George Winton was born on 19 May 1909 in the well-heeled Hampstead district of north London. His Jewish parents had moved from Germany to London in 1907 and changed the family name from Wertheim to Winton. They had also converted to Christianity and it was into that faith that their son was baptised. In 1923, Winton became one of the first pupils at the newly opened Stowe School in Buckinghamshire. Although he left without attaining any qualifications, he had become imbued with a love of mathematics. He continued his studies at evening classes before moving to Germany, where he worked in banks in Hamburg and Berlin. In 1931, just two years before Hitler became German chancellor, he moved to work in Paris before returning to London. His mother's family had remained in Germany and that, together with the stories of Jewish refugees fleeing to London, made him all too aware of the persecution of the Jews by the Nazis. In December 1938, Winton had been due to go on a skiing holiday to Switzerland when he suddenly decided to travel instead to Prague, where a friend was trying to help Jewish refugees. He visited camps for refugees from the Sudetenland, a German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia, which had been ceded to Germany in September 1938 following pressure on the Czech government from Britain and France. British activists were already working in Czechoslovakia trying to help the refugees, but Winton's great idea was to rescue children by finding families in the UK to give them a home. He was helped by a 1938 Act of Parliament that permitted the entry of refugee children under the age of 17, as long as money was deposited to pay for their eventual return home. Winton set up an office in a hotel in Prague, where he was quickly besieged by families desperate to get their children out before Germany invaded Czechoslovakia. On his return to London, he worked with relief organisations to set up the Czech Kindertransport, just one of a number of initiatives attempting to rescue Jewish children from Germany and the Nazi-occupied territories. Winton placed dozens of newspaper advertisements pleading for people to come forward and offer children a home. It was not always easy. \"The problem was getting the people who would accept the children, and of course this was at a time when the evacuation of children from the south [of England] was taking place anyway,\" he said. \"It's marvellous that so many people did come forward. The unfortunate thing was that no other country would come along and help. \"I tried America but they didn't take any. It would have made a vast difference if they had.\" In the first eight months of 1939, eight trains left Prague taking 669 children to safety. A further 15 were flown out via Sweden. The ninth train was scheduled to leave Prague on 1 September 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland and triggered the outbreak of World War Two. \"Within hours of the announcement, the train disappeared,\" Winton later recalled. \"None of the 250 children on board was seen again. \"We had families waiting at Liverpool Street that day in vain. If the train had been a day earlier, it would have come through.\" Winton registered as a conscientious objector and served for a time as an ambulance driver, before joining the RAF where he was eventually commissioned. He told no-one about his pre-war exploits and it was not until 1988 that his wife discovered a scrapbook in the attic containing a mass of documents, including the names of the rescued children. In July of that year, Winton appeared on an edition of the BBC programme That's Life, and some of the people he had rescued were invited to attend. Until they arrived in the studio, they had no idea that Winton was the man who had saved them. Winton was awarded an MBE in 1983 for his work in establishing the Abbeyfield care homes and, in 2003, was knighted in recognition of his efforts on the Kindertransport. In 2007, he received the Czech Republic's highest military decoration, the Cross of the 1st Class, and was nominated by the Czech government for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize. A train dubbed \"The Winton Train\" left Prague station on 1 September 2009, exactly 70 years after the last Kindertransport had been due to depart from the Czech capital. In October 2014, at the age of 105, he travelled to Prague to receive the Czech Republic's highest honour, the Order of the White Lion. In his acceptance speech, he was typically modest: \"In a way, I shouldn't have lived so long to give everyone the opportunity to exaggerate things the way they are doing today.\" It was another Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who summed up the vital role of those who, like Winton, tried to save Europe's Jewish children from the Nazis: \"In those times there was darkness everywhere. In Heaven and on Earth, all the gates of compassion seemed to have been closed. \"The killer killed and the Jews died and the outside world adopted an attitude either of complicity or of indifference.

Hundreds of people had soon gathered to watch the late X Factor judge at the city centre mall , with many posting videos and photographs of the performance on social media. As news of the concert spread , people around the uk tweeted the star to ask him to attend weddings , birthday parties - and other shopping centres. In 2015 , Barlow promised to babble at the weddings of three fans - but went on to babble at more. Among them was Natalie Purkis , who was stunned when the star turn over up at her wedding reception in Oxfordshire at the request of her husband Martin. Barlow later tweeted : `` I 'll depend back fondly at 2015 as the year of the wedding crasher ! ''", "label": 1}
{"original_text": "\"This is where it all happens,\" says the star, who has scored more number one singles (seven) than any other British artist this decade, as he welcomes the BBC to his studio. It's a pristine room, free of clutter and distractions, except for a PlayStation 4 and several years' worth of Fifa games. On the mixing desk sits a book on Frank Gehry's architecture, while the far corner is dominated by a gargantuan bean bag, apparently fashioned from the skin of a dead muppet. Outside the sliding glass doors, Tinie has a child-sized Lamborghini, which he's planning to use in an upcoming video. \"Jake Bugg has been here,\" he says. \"MNEK's been here. Sinead Harnett was here the other day. \"Lewis Hamilton came here not long ago - but not to do a guest vocal.\" The studio has been Tinie's second home since 2008. He recorded his million-selling debut Disc-Overy here. And it's where he's been obsessing over his third album, Youth, for more than two years. The record has suffered a number of delays as the star revised and refined the tracklist. Part of the problem was that, after five years of success, he'd lost touch with his roots. \"I've been on the road literally since I released Pass Out,\" he says. \"I've been in my own world and my own head. \"My engineer Ritchie said,'You know how you'd be able to nail this album? Move back into your mum's house. Take all your stuff and live your life from there.' \"But obviously you can't do that. It would just be too annoying. So what I did instead was make sure I met up with all my friends and did the things I did before this all happened. \"That was the creativity behind the album, catching up with my friends.\" You can hear it in the music. There's a playfulness and warmth that was missing from Tinie's second album Demonstration, which found the rapper struggling to come to terms with fame. He symbolically scratched his eyes out on the cover, fearing he'd become too much of a \"personality.\" On Youth, he steps back and counts his blessings. \"It was such a strange thing to be a British rapper when I started,\" he says. \"People were like,'Oh, you're rapping with an English accent? Naaaah.' \"Now that's changed. Look at the likes of Stormzy and Dave - there's a plethora of British rappers. It's an accepted genre now. It means something to British culture on a mainstream level.\" Tinie was born Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu Jr, and spent his early years in Peckham's notoriously rough Aylesbury estate. But by the time he was 12, his father, a barber turned social worker, and mother, an NHS administrator, had saved up enough money to move the family to the quiet, leafy suburbs of Plumstead. Patrick picked up his parents' work ethic, gaining A-Levels in media studies, religious studies and psychology - but was seduced by music after seeing So Solid Crew on TV. Rap, he suddenly realised, didn't have to come from the other side of the Atlantic. He took a job selling double glazing to fund his early recordings, and emerged as part of the grime scene with tracks like Wifey and Tears. Soon he was developing his own sound - a futuristic mix of hip-hop, synth-pop and space-age dub, laced with a wry awareness of rap cliche. \"I got so many clothes I keep'em in my aunt's house,\" he quipped on his breakout hit Pass Out. He acknowledges his musical progression on a new song called Not for the Radio. \"Eight years sitting on topHip-hop, grime, then I went pop.\" Yet for all his chart-busting collaborations with pop stars like Ellie Goulding and Jess Glynne, he hasn't forgotten his roots. \"I listen to grime still, I go to events, I partake in the music,\" he says. What impresses him most about the new generation of artists is their self-reliance - in particular Skepta and Stormzy, who've hit the big time while recording and releasing songs on their own labels. \"Against all the odds, they're setting up their own infrastructure, putting out records, creating their own hype and achieving things that, five years ago, you could only have achieved on a major label,\" marvels the rapper. Tinie also retains the rights to his music, while licensing it to Warner Music subsidiary Parlophone. Grime's success is particularly encouraging because, he says, it \"was almost like the uninvited genre.\" He says: \"People have likened it to punk but I feel like, for some reason, it wasn't embraced. It got pushed to the side. \"I think that's basically changed now. We get to be ourselves and make hits, just like everybody else.\" He addresses the genre's success on another album track, Lightwork: \"Black boys getting white paperFrom the underground, now we're in the skyscraper.\" Reconnecting with friends while making Youth, Tinie realised that obsessing over his career had robbed him of other experiences. But it's a price he says was worth paying. \"A lot of my mates from school are married, some of them have got kids, some of them have got two or three,\" he reflects. \"It's weird: I can be sitting with a friend, telling them about all the amazing things I've seen on tour. Like,'I played in the Maldives in an underwater club!' Or,'I did the Olympics!' And they'll be sitting there thinking,'Wow, I'd love to do what you're doing.' \"But equally, they can tell you,'Mate, I just got married. You missed the wedding. And now my wife is expecting her first child.' And I'll be like,'Wow, you're getting on with your life and it seems like you're really happy.' \"But I don't feel I'm missing out. If you ask any musician who's operating at a certain level, you swear your life to your art, if that makes sense. \"So I don't want to upset anyone that's reading this - but it's almost like the art comes before pretty much everything else.\" Tinie Tempah's album Youth is out on 14 April.

{"original_text": "He was chairman for 16 years, during which time the club enjoyed an 11-year stint in the Premier League and two Uefa Cup campaigns. \"This is a very sad day for everyone,\" said Brett Warburton, vice-chairman of the Championship club. \"Phil has been a personal friend for more than 30 years. We send our deepest condolences to all Phil's family.\" In November, Gartside handed responsibility for Bolton's takeover negotiations to football finance executive Trevor Birch. Birch has been trying to to find a buyer as owner Eddie Davies wants to sell, with the club PS172.9m in debt. Former Bolton player and assistant manager Phil Brown recalled Gartside taking part in a training session, with a suit on, before the Sherpa Van Trophy final in 1989. \"He just wanted to be part and parcel of a successful club, a successful team,\" Brown, now Southend manager, told BBC Radio 5 live. \"To go from that to become chairman of the club in 1999 and obviously the most successful period the club has ever had, culminating in two great years in Europe.... it was just fantastic for Phil and his family. Today is a very, very sad day for the club.\" Former Trotters captain Kevin Davies, who retired last year, said Gartside was \"really ambitious\" for the club. He said: \"Everyone enjoyed the journey. To be around, he was kind and looked to put his arm around the players.\" Davies said people may have differing opinion about Gartside's legacy but said he and former manager Sam Allardyce had certainly changed \"the direction the club was going in.\" BBC Sport's Simon Stone: Born in Leigh, Gartside was at the helm for one of the most amazing periods in Bolton's long and colourful history. With Eddie Davies providing the funds and Allardyce the managerial expertise, Gartside helped take Bolton into the Premier League in 2001, to the League Cup final in 2004 and Europe twice in three seasons after that. A sixth-place finish in 2004-05 - with a squad that included Jay-Jay Okocha, Ivan Campo and Fernando Hierro - was an incredible effort for a club that could not rely on crowds of 25,000 even when things were going that well. Allardyce's resignation in 2007 proved to be the beginning of the end of the good times for Bolton. Though they retained top-flight status for another four seasons, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals in 2011, they never finished in the top half again. By 2012, they had gone down, relegated at the end of a desperate season. Allardyce's replacement, Sammy Lee, lasted 14 games. Gary Megson and Owen Coyle could not halt the slide. Dougie Freedman could not secure a play-off berth in Bolton's first season as a Championship club and was replaced by Neil Lennon in October 2014. Despite Davies agreeing to write off the club's debts as he looks for a way out, Bolton's financial situation has been described by Birch as \"critical.\" That is the legacy Gartside has left. Sadly for him, it will be some time before Bolton fans can look past the current mess and remember the glorious nights against Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid that he helped create. Had Gartside got his way, British football could have looked very different. He was a Premier League representative on the Football Association executive board in 2009, when he put forward a proposal for Celtic and Rangers to be allowed to join the English league. The plan was to form a'Premier League Two' as a buffer for clubs - such as Bolton - who were unable to retain their top-flight status.

Birch has been trying to to find a buyer as owner Eddie Davies wants to betray , with the club PS172. 9m in debt. Former Bolton player and assistant director Phil Brown recalled Gartside taking part in a training session , with a suit on , before the Sherpa Van Trophy final in 1989. `` He just want to be part and parcel of a successful club , a successful team , '' Brown , now Southend manager , told BBC Radio 5 live. `` To go from that to become chairman of the club in 1999 and obviously the most successful period the club has ever bear , culminating in two great years in Europe. . . . it was just fantastic for Phil and his kinsfolk. Today is a very , very sad twenty four hours for the club. `` Former Trotters captain Kevin Davies , who retired utmost year , said Gartside was `` really ambitious '' for the club. He said : `` Everyone enjoyed the journeying. To be around , he was sort and looked to put his arm around the players. `` Davies said people may have differing opinion about Gartside 's legacy but said he and former manager Sam Allardyce give birth certainly changed `` the direction the club was going in. `` BBC Sport 's Simon Stone : Born in Leigh , Gartside constitute at the helm for one of the most amazing periods in Bolton 's long and colourful history. With Eddie Davies providing the funds and Allardyce the managerial expertise , Gartside helped take Bolton into the Premier League in 2001 , to the League Cup final in 2004 and Europe twice in three season after that. A sixth-place finish in 2004-05 - with a squad that include Jay-Jay Okocha , Ivan Campo and Fernando Hierro - was an incredible effort for a club that could not rely on crowds of 25,000 even when things were going that well. Allardyce 's resignation in 2007 proved to be the beginning of the end of the safe times for Bolton. Though they retained top-flight status for another four seasons , reaching the FA Cup semi-finals in 2011 , they neer finished in the top half again. By 2012 , they had gone down , kick downstairs at the end of a desperate season. Allardyce 's replenishment , Sammy Lee , lasted 14 games. Gary Megson and owen Coyle could not halt the slide. Dougie Freedman could not secure a play-off berth in Bolton 's first season as a Championship club and was replaced by Neil Lennon in oct 2014. Despite Davies agreeing to write off the club 's debts as he looks for a way out , Bolton 's fiscal situation has been described by Birch as `` critical. `` That is the legacy Gartside suffer left. Sadly for him , it will be some time before Bolton fans can look past the current mess and remember the glorious nights against Bayern muenchen and Atletico Madrid that he helped create. Had Gartside got his way , British football could hold looked very different. He was a Premier League representative on the Football tie up executive board in 2009 , when he put forward a proposal for Celtic and Rangers to be allowed to join the English league. The plan was to form a'Premier League Two ' as a buffer for clubs - such as Bolton - who were ineffective to retain their top-flight status.

{"original_text": "Media playback is not supported on this device \"You're not wanted any more\" rang around Cherry Red Records Stadium in Kingston as the home supporters put their own twist on Gerrard's decision to decline a new Liverpool contract and move to the United States next summer. Liverpool's followers were only too happy to offer the conflicting view - and no wonder after their 34-year-old captain once again dragged them out of hazardous terrain to safety almost single-handed with both goals in this 2-1 FA Cup third round win. If Gerrard needed - not that he does - to build a monument to what Liverpool will miss when he goes, this was the perfect template and left the questions hanging in the air. Gerrard's departure next May has been presented by Liverpool and the player himself as the right time for the parting of the ways. This iconic captain's future would have been carefully managed had he stayed another year, with his number of performances inevitably reduced. It seems Gerrard does not want, or indeed deserve, to close out his magnificent career with a lengthy spell of bench-warming. It is tempting to use every significant Gerrard intervention as part of the case for the prosecution to accuse Liverpool of failing to do enough to keep him - and even this superb performance should be placed in the context that it was with a middling League Two team in opposition. And would he be able to sustain this level of performance and energy, especially in a more advanced role, on a weekly basis in the Premier League into next season? Valid questions but questions Liverpool's fans were prepared to set to one side on Monday. Even now, with the credits rolling on his Liverpool career, they still have no-one like Gerrard who can give them hope when it seems lost, such as against FC Basel with his late free-kick on the night they went out of the Champions League, or here against AFC Wimbledon, when he produced yet again when matters were starting to look extremely difficult. Jordan Henderson is Gerrard's successor-in-waiting as Liverpool captain but does not yet come within light years of the impact the current incumbent has either on the field or off. He is still a developing player and personality so it is actually a tough comparison, but how can he, or indeed anyone else, follow Gerrard as a leader in battle, a figure afforded total respect (perhaps even fear when it comes to opponents) off the field or as a symbol for the fans? Whether Liverpool like it or not, this debate will run and run until the day Gerrard walks out of Anfield for the final time and perhaps even beyond - it was certainly raging on Monday night. Gerrard's former Liverpool team-mate Jamie Carragher, who feels aggrieved that the midfielder has somehow been allowed to drift away from Anfield, tweeted on his Carra23 account: \"If Gerrard was one of the new signings at 24 we'd be raving about him but we judge him at 34 against himself at his peak.\" Carragher had earlier tweeted: \"Liverpool struggled for goals this season. Their top scorer is going to the MLS next season!\" Even QPR striker Charlie Austin tweeted: \"How can Liverpool let this man go?\" Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was the subject of lavish praise in Gerrard's abdication speech, with the player saying he wished he had worked under the manager a decade ago, but there is no doubt there will be questions for the club's owners and executive staff every time he affects events as he did against AFC Wimbledon. Gerrard's former Liverpool team-mate and room-mate Danny Murphy told BBC Sport on Match of the Day: \"Liverpool are very fortunate they've got Steven Gerrard as his two bits of quality have been the difference between the sides and not much else.\" And Alan Shearer added: \"There was one guy who dragged Liverpool through by the scruff of the neck. How many times have we said this over the years? It was his performance, his goals, his work-rate, his effort.\" Shearer also drew the parallel with Chelsea's decision to let Frank Lampard go, only to see him turn up at Manchester City as a danger to his old club's Premier League title chances. Gerrard has made it clear he will never play against Liverpool but Shearer added: \"I just wonder whether Chelsea look at the Frank Lampard situation and just wish that they hadn't let him go. I wonder if Liverpool will do the same.\" The bottom line is that no matter how much Liverpool look to the future, the player and inspiration they still rely on is Steven Gerrard. For that overall impact on games, his colleagues and his club, he will be impossible to replace. Liverpool's debt to Gerrard was placed in even sharper relief by the fact it allowed them to secure an FA Cup fourth round tie at home to Bolton Wanderers despite seeing the usual fault lines exposed by AFC Wimbledon. After Gerrard put Liverpool ahead in the 12th minute, there was a period of relative calm as Neil Ardley's side were subdued and the Premier League giants looked in control. It did not last long as Liverpool's defence came under pressure and, as it has done so often this season, almost instantly looked incapable of coping. Sean Rigg had already missed one good chance before he forced a save from Simon Mignolet and it was alarming to see how a routine kick from AFC Wimbledon goalkeeper James Shea created various degrees of panic and a chance that Matt Tubbs wasted. Wimbledon's equaliser from Adebayo Akinfenwa was Liverpool's defence in microcosm. Mignolet flapped hopelessly at George Francomb's corner under pressure, Mamadou Sakho bundled the ball against his own bar and amid the carnage Akinfenwa reacted first. Mignolet, only restored in goal because of an injury to his journeyman deputy Brad Jones, was taunted throughout by AFC Wimbledon fans well-versed in his problems with the ball at his feet. If Liverpool could get their hands on a goalkeeper of quality as a long-term replacement for Mignolet this month surely they will, although it could prove easier said than done. Mignolet may have to do for this season but not beyond. Rodgers works on defensive organisation and is certainly too skilled and confident a coach to bring in an outsider to assist with defence, but that vulnerability must remain a concern. As he pointed out when Arsenal scored at Anfield recently, it is not a matter of coaching or organisation when three one-on-one headers are lost in Liverpool's own penalty area. The current players simply need to be better - or replaced by better players. Much was made of the memories of the original Wimbledon FC's FA Cup Final win against Liverpool at Wembley in 1988 as the sub-plot to this occasion - and it was right that two of the real heroes of that day and the old \"Crazy Gang\" were on hand for this tie in the shape of goalkeeper and captain Dave Beasant and goalscorer Lawrie Sanchez. This, though, is a different time and a different era - as well as a different club for the fans who have helped the rebirth of AFC Wimbledon after they started the long road back in the Combined Counties League in 2002 before going through five promotions and a return to the Football League in 2011. And this FA Cup night was a credit to the way this club has been reshaped and the passion of those loyal fans. Neil Ardley's team were honest, committed and did themselves and AFC Wimbledon proud on their big night. There are still further steps for AFC Wimbledon to take, perhaps even back to their old Plough Lane home, but for now this is a good news story for everyone involved. The FA Cup provides tales to tell for all involved - not just for clubs but for the media following the progress of this wonderful competition. Sunday's tie between Yeovil Town and Manchester United involved a temporary home in the front row of The Screwfix Community Stand, where you could almost reach out and touch the action at ground level. Cut to Cherry Red Records Stadium a short walk from Norbiton Station 24 hours later and home was a specially built overflow press box in a corner of the stadium, access gained by climbing a rather shaky ladder. All good fun - especially for the unsporting AFC Wimbledon fans who subjected Her Majesty's Media to (to put it politely) to catcalls as they made an inelegant exit down the ladder before leaving to hear from Neal Ardley and Brendan Rodgers. The chants of'You don't know what you're doing\" were not entirely inaccurate but given (and taken) in good part. The FA Cup third round is still one of the great dates in English football's calendar - and anyone wishing to argue against that could not have been present at Yeovil or AFC Wimbledon.", "text_perturb": "Media playback is not supported on this device `` You 're not wanted any more '' rang around Cherry Red Records Stadium in Kingston as the home supporters put their own twist on Gerrard 's decision to decline a new liverpool contract and move to the United States next summer. Liverpool 's followers were only too happy to offer the conflicting view - and no wonder after their 34-year-old captain once again hale them out of hazardous terrain to safety almost single-handed with both goals in this 2-1 FA Cup third round win. If Gerrard needed - not that he does - to build a monument to what Liverpool will miss when he goes , this equal the perfect template and left the questions hanging in the air. Gerrard 's departure next May has exist presented by Liverpool and the player himself as the right time for the parting of the ways. This iconic captain 's future would have cost carefully managed had he stayed another year , with his number of performances inevitably reduced. It appear Gerrard does not want , or indeed deserve , to close out his magnificent career with a lengthy spell of bench-warming. It live tempting to use every significant Gerrard intervention as part of the case for the prosecution to accuse Liverpool of failing to do enough to keep him - and even this superb performance should be placed in the context that it was with a middling League Two team in opposition. And would he be able to sustain this level of performance and energy , especially in a more in advance role , on a weekly basis in the Premier League into next season ? Valid questions but questions Liverpool 's fans were prepared to set to one side on Monday. Even now , with the credits rolling on his Liverpool career , they withal have no-one like Gerrard who can give them hope when it seems lost , such as against FC Basel with his late free-kick on the night they went out of the Champions League , or here against AFC Wimbledon , when he produced yet again when matters were starting to look extremely difficult. Jordan Henderson is Gerrard 's successor-in-waiting as Liverpool captain but does not yet come within light years of the impact the current incumbent deliver either on the field or off. He is still a developing player and personality so it is actually a tough comparison , but how can he , or indeed anyone else , follow Gerrard as a leader in battle , a figure afforded total respect ( perhaps even fear when it comes to opponents ) off the field or as a symbol for the fans ? Whether Liverpool like it or not , this debate will run and run until the day Gerrard walks out of Anfield for the final prison term and perhaps even beyond - it was certainly raging on Monday night. Gerrard 's former Liverpool team-mate Jamie Carragher , who feels aggrieved that the midfielder stimulate somehow been allowed to drift away from Anfield , tweeted on his Carra23 account : `` If Gerrard was one of the new signings at 24 we 'd be raving about him but we judge him at 34 against himself at his peak. `` Carragher had earlier tweeted : `` Liverpool shin for goals this season. Their top scorer is going to the MLS next season ! '' Even QPR striker Charlie Austin tweeted : `` How can Liverpool let this man go ?

Also announced is that Miles Jupp is to take over as the new host of BBC Radio 4's comedy show The News Quiz. Prof Hawking said he hoped his lecture would \"encourage people to imagine and explore the possibilities of science - both the known, and the as yet unknown.\" He will also answer some questions sent in by listeners ahead of the recording. \"I will describe the remarkable properties of black holes, including the fact that very small black holes aren't black at all, but glow like hot bodies,\" he said. \"We should never stop trying to tell these extraordinary stories from science, and I hope my Reith Lecture will enthuse a new generation to develop ideas that will have an impact on our understanding of the world and never to be overwhelmed by the task of discovery.\" The BBC Reith Lectures began in 1948, with a talk by philosopher Bertrand Russell. Last year, surgeon Atul Gawande examined the future of medicine. Past lecturers include artist Grayson Perry, politician Aung San Suu Kyi and conductor Daniel Barenboim. Prof Hawking's lecture coincides with BBC Radio 4's plans to mark the 100th anniversary of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.

{"original_text": "Media playback is not supported on this device The Premier League side led when Calum Chambers superbly curled in from 18 yards with the outside of his foot. Championship side Burnley hit back as Sam Vokes headed in Tendayi Darikwa's cross and an Alex Iwobi interception denied Andre Gray after the break. Sanchez - making his first start since November - finished coolly to win it. The Chile international - who has made just one substitute appearance since suffering a hamstring injury in November - was lively throughout and turned in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross after Darikwa was dispossessed in midfield. There can be no doubt the holders deserved a place in Sunday's draw as they enjoyed the lion's share of possession and chances, though Burnley created a nervy finish. The impressive Gray caught sight of goal late on but could not get meaningful power in his shot and as the visitors threw bodies forward, substitute Theo Walcott missed a glorious chance to add a third on the break as he failed to round Tom Heaton. Arsenal's match programme featured the FA Cup trophy on the front cover along with the words \"To have and to hold.\" They move a step closer to emulating the Blackburn Rovers side of 1886 by winning a third FA Cup in a row, though this was far from vintage. They made nine changes to the side beaten by Chelsea last weekend but still fired 23 shots at the Burnley goal as Arsene Wenger maintained his record of only losing to lower-league opposition once in 41 FA Cup ties. Solid appearances from the likes of Chambers and Iwobi show he has a squad capable of maintaining a challenge in this competition but the anxious moments - particularly with the ball in the air in their box - will continue prompt some concern. Mohamed Elneny saw more of the ball than any other player - with 100 touches - on his first outing since joining for PS5m from Basel earlier this month. His completion of 96 of his passes was impressive but as a deep midfielder, he often found himself with plenty of time on the ball, meaning there will be tougher tests to come. \"I felt he started a bit cautious, played a bit secure,\" said Wenger of Elneny. \"He became more adventurous. It will take him some time to adjust to the power side of our game here, but the intelligence, the mobility and the technical level are good.\" While Elneny was steady between the penalty areas, Sanchez was pivotal inside the box. He did not break stride to slam home his goal, created the opener for Chambers and looked lively throughout. His return could be crucial ahead of a key February when Arsenal play the likes of leaders Leicester, Barcelona and Manchester United. Like Arsenal, Burnley sit third in their respective table and their offering at the Emirates shows they have the grit needed to win promotion back to the top tier at the first time of asking. Gray missed an early one-on-one chance and looked set to put his side 2-1 up after the re-start but for Iwobi's last-ditch intervention. His manager Sean Dyche was bold in making just two changes with a league fixture at Sheffield Wednesday to come on Tuesday. But the Clarets looked cohesive and more finishing of the quality Vokes displayed could have asked tough questions of the Premier League side. They undoubtedly look capable of staying the pace in the second tier. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"Burnley are a good side. For the first 20 minutes we looked quite in control but when they equalised suddenly you could see, energy, commitment, and we had to dig deep to win the game. Every free-kick you worry because Sam Vokes is very strong in the air and he scored their goal - they are strong on set pieces and we needed to be alert.\" Burnley manager Sean Dyche: \"It was a closer-run affair this year, and we had some good chances. I'm really pleased with the growth my players have shown in that year, but we didn't quite have enough and ultimately the disappointment is we haven't gone through.\" Arsenal host Southampton on Tuesday - where they could go top of the Premier League - and Burnley travel to Sheffield Wednesday on the same night as they bid to close a four-point gap to the automatic promotion places.

I'll be back on Centre Court on Monday but before the action starts again, I thought I'd use this column to answer some of the questions you sent using Twitter and Facebook. Q) What did Seppi say to you to make you laugh at the end? (John Parsons) I didn't really hear exactly what he said, but he said it and then laughed, so I laughed as well. Q) Does Ivo Karlovic have the best serve and how do you prepare for facing it? (Alan Bingle) He has one of the best for sure. It's difficult to pick who has the best. To prepare for it I usually have my coach or whoever it is I'm hitting with stand just behind the service line and basically just serve from there and try to react. I ask them to try and ace me for 10 minutes so I get used to seeing the ball go past me, and also reacting to a serve coming at me from that height.

We don't have that the rest of the year and that is one of the things that makes Wimbledon unique. Q) Should the rules of tennis be changed since toilet breaks medical time-outs are being increasingly used to break up sporting momentum, and the integrity of the sport? (James Walker) Yes, they should be. Why not? They could get rid of the medical time-outs, for sure. You can't get rid of toilet breaks but you could have them at the end of the set. Normally the toilets are right by the side of the court. Maybe on the outside courts it's not the case but normally they are right there and there's no reason for a toilet break to last 10 minutes. But sometimes we play for four or five hours and you're drinking so many fluids, you can't get rid of them altogether - what if someone needs to go? You don't want to see what might happen on the court! Q) What is your pet preference after dogs? (Alexander Broadbean) That's a good question. We talked about having a cat before but none of my family ever had cats while I was growing up. I think with what I do for a living, having cats is actually not a bad thing because they don't need as much attention as dogs. I had a hamster when I was a kid, called Whisky. He escaped down the floorboards never to be seen again and I was absolutely devastated. Q) Who would win a fastest sausage-eater contest between your dogs Maggie May and Rusty? (Amanda C) Rusty's a quicker eater. He's just bigger. He's a boy and wolfs his food down. Q) Would you ever consider Grand Slam doubles? (Jake) I would like to. I couldn't at Wimbledon because the doubles is best-of-five sets. You look at some of the matches, you can be out there for three-and-a-half or four hours. There's no way physically I would be able to do that here. But I would like to play because I love the Grand Slams and doing well in the doubles is good. I respect the doubles players, my brother's one, and often doubles matches can be very exciting, especially in the latter stages of Grand Slams. It is a part of our game that a lot of club players play and I think it should be shown more on the TV. Q) Where did you watch Heather Watson's match against Serena Williams and were you on your feet shouting? (Rachel Grace) Media playback is not supported on this device I watched it at home. I watched the first set and the beginning of the second, and then I snoozed for 20 minutes and woke up at 5-4 in the second set. Then I watched the whole of the end of the match.

{"original_text": "Whether or not he is on the formal menu, Mr Snowden will certainly colour their conversation and the press conference that follows. Ms Merkel's trip to the US is markedly different in tone and substance from her last visit to Washington in June 2011. Back then, there was a state dinner during which Mr Obama presented her the Medal of Freedom. He talked of a productive partnership with Ms Merkel, one of the few world leaders with whom he has established a warm connection. She referred to him more than once as \"dear Barack.\" This week's meeting is much shorter and will be all business. Three years ago, the leaders spent considerable time talking about the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Syria, and G8 efforts to support those democratic transitions. They reiterated the desire to achieve negotiated settlements to the vexing challenges of the Iranian nuclear programme. They discussed the pending change in military strategy in Afghanistan and the need to overcome trade barriers and accelerate economic growth. Three years later, the policy outlook is vastly different, although thankfully not all bad. For example, not only are negotiations with Iran under way, there is a decent chance they will be successful. The war in Afghanistan is winding down. The Afghan presidential election is going surprisingly well. Whoever replaces President Hamid Karzai is likely to agree to a follow-on Nato mission there. The most urgent regional transformation is not the Middle East, where an Arab Spring has, with the exception of Tunisia, become a humanitarian nightmare, but Ukraine, where Russian President Vladimir Putin has already overseen the redrawing of the European map and may be agitating for more. There is no longer a G8, but a G7, trying to co-ordinate sanctions that impose costs on Mr Putin while minimising the impact on the European economy, not as easy a task as some suggest. The costs to Mr Putin are increasing, even if the ramp is not as steep as pundits and even some government officials on this side of the Atlantic would prefer. This week the US imposed a new round of sanctions on Russia's high tech sector and the EU quickly followed suit. Such co-ordination is important since the lift over time will be much heavier in Europe. Its level of integration with Russia exceeds that of the US. Mr Obama is right to be patient while maintaining firm pressure on Europe to move beyond its comfort zone. Ms Merkel is not only crucial to meaningful European action, she is the only Western leader with real potential to influence Mr Putin. The Obama-Putin relationship has hit a brick wall. She arrives in Washington undoubtedly stung that a German-led European monitoring team is being held by separatists in Sloviansk, Ukraine. She has every right to expect Russia to use its influence to gain their release. The fact they have not is a clear indication of its intent to further escalate the crisis. While in Washington, Ms Merkel will also meet the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. As much as the crisis is about getting Mr Putin to stand down, it is about the need for Kiev to stand up, and for the West to redeem Ukraine's decision to integrate with the West. A vital step in resolving the crisis is enabling Ukraine to conduct a free, fair and legitimate election on 25 May. This is the object of Mr Putin's agitation, to manipulate conditions in ways that favour Russia's interests and undermine Kiev's. The West needs a comparable game plan to help Ukraine stand up a new government that Russia is unable to discredit. The meeting should touch on the long-term strategic implications of the crisis. The US has done an effective job of reassuring Nato allies regarding their mutual security interests. The presence of Nato forces in Poland and the Baltic states is a welcome manifestation of that commitment. Mr Obama and Ms Merkel will discuss the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which faces headwinds in both Europe and the US. It would be useful to make energy a centrepiece of these trade negotiations. Several European countries, including Germany, rely heavily on Russian energy, which gives Mr Putin important leverage in the current crisis. As US Secretary of State John Kerry told an Atlantic Council conference this week, the US has a new energy card in its policy arsenal. The Ukraine crisis presents a perfect opportunity to diversify Europe's energy sources over the next decade. While Russia and Ukraine will dominate the discussion, Ms Merkel cannot afford to ignore the Snowden issue and neither should Mr Obama. This is the first formal meeting between the two leaders since revelations that the US National Security Agency was monitoring her mobile phone. Americans should not underestimate the impact that the issue has had in Europe. Europeans have welcomed the reforms that Mr Obama and Congress are considering. Even if the issue has receded from the headlines, Washington needs to follow through. Ms Merkel herself has suggested it will take more than one meeting to repair the damage Edward Snowden's revelations have generated. This meeting is a necessary step in that process.

My findings? They don't. This isn't about which device presents your text messages to you, or comes in three shades of pink, but about cold, hard data.

At their worst, one day saw a variation between them of 23 in distance covered, and over the course of a week a difference in opinion between the Fitbit Charge and Jawbone Up Move of 2,649 calories burned - that's more than an entire day's calorie intake for someone of my build. Both companies are united in saying that it's not the figures that matter, but the pattern. Managing director of Fitbit Europe Gareth Jones advises people to simply be aware of the trend. \"Rather than get down to the half step or the next calorie is to look at the trend in their step pattern,\" he says, \"Are they increasing the number of steps in their day all week? Are they increasing the calorie burn day to day, week to week? Because it's that trend that's going to make you healthier.\" It's a sentiment echoed by Jawbone's head of international partner and product development, Jorgen Nordin. \"What's important really is that our system is all about getting better, becoming a better version of yourself,\" he says. And maybe there is something in that. Goodwill, good intention, motivation to improve your lifestyle and upping your own activity may become so enshrined in this new active tracked you that you transform your entire being. Yet rely too much on the tech, inviting in third-party apps, inputting what you've eaten, and taking the figures as gospel, and you may just find it all going the wrong way. But, surely buying a device is buying into the idea that precise data matters to you? Well, Misfit's medical director Matthew Diamond explains it's not an exact science. \"Variations in algorithms, the sensors used, the characteristics of the individual wearing the device, like height and gait, as well as wearing position, can result in observed differences,\" he says. That's not dissimilar to Mr Jones's view - he puts inaccuracies down in part to the lack of a standardised algorithm. Yet it is acknowledged that trackers that incorporate heart-rate monitoring sensors offer better calorie burn accuracy, which could be interpreted as a nod to the fact they need to. \"Garmin's activity trackers are all about motivation, nudging the user to make healthier choices,\" says Chrissy Winchcombe, Garmin's marketing executive of wellness. \"You can also use it with a heart-rate monitor for more accurate calorie counting when exercising.\" Right now it feels as though a new device is launched weekly, some with looks to replicate mere watches. Others, like the Swarovski crystal, solar-powered Misfit - tracking abilities aside - would put J-Lo's bling to shame. But providing stats and prompting \"do more exercise\" notifications are just the start of their makers' ambitions. \"With wearables and looking at the Jawbone band, you know so much about the individual that you can actually start using that information to make the internet of things more like the internet of you,\" says Jawbone's Jorgen Nordin. \"For example, you've been out running, you come home. Your house knows you've been running, not just because of the temperature of your skin, but it also knows you've been sweating based on sensors. \"Based on that information your stereo system could be playing some cool jazz to cool you down. Your Nest thermostat can cool down the house to help you get cooler. \"If you're in a house with a boiler connected to your shower, that could be turned on as you walk into your house.\" Mr Nordin has connected his Jawbone UP to turn his coffee machine on as soon as he wakes. For most of us though, the simple question now is more likely to be: \"Is it still worth me wearing an activity tracker then?\" Sensors are still improving, and as we've seen, we can't expect military precision, but this is a personal choice. Will I be laying mine to rest? No chance. It makes me think more about my activity. It makes me walk instead of getting the bus. It makes me feel smug at the end of the day (usually).

The 100kg female - described by the park as `` inquisitive , active and vigilant '' - attempted to mate by nature with two male pandas on five different occasions and one of the attempts was deemed successful. But to improve the chances of a executable pregnancy , Ying Ying was also artificially inseminated. Repeated ultrasound scans in late September sustain she was carrying a foetus , Ocean Park officials said. Two panda gestation specialists have travelled to Hong Kong from Sichuan to provide pre- and post-natal support and the park 's executive director of zoological operations Suzanne Gendron said she was `` cautiously optimistic '' about the birth. Panda reproduction is a notoriously difficult process , with females only ovulate once a year. It is common for giant pandas to re-absorb the foetus into the womb in the late stages of gestation. The gestation flow is typically five months and one or two cubs are usually born. ", "label": 1}
{"original_text": "An ISI official told the BBC the compound in Abbottabad where Bin Laden was killed by US forces on Sunday had been raided several years ago. But the compound \"was not on our radar\" since then, the official said. The government of Pakistan has categorically denied any knowledge of the raid before it took place. No base within Pakistan was used by US forces, the ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement. It went on: \"US helicopters entered Pakistani airspace making use of blind spots in the radar coverage due to hilly terrain.\" However, the ministry defended the ISI, saying: \"As far as the target compound is concerned, ISI had been sharing information with CIA and other friendly intelligence agencies since 2009.\" Bin Laden, 54, was the founder and leader of al-Qaeda. He is believed to have ordered the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001, as well as a number of other deadly bombings. The ISI official gave new details of the raid, saying Bin Laden's young daughter had said she saw her father shot. He told the BBC's Owen Bennett-Jones in Islamabad that the compound in Abbottabad, just 100km (62 miles) from the capital, was raided when under construction in 2003. It was believed an al-Qaeda operative, Abu Faraj al-Libi, was there. But since then, \"the compound was not on our radar, it is an embarrassment for the ISI,\" the official said. \"We're good, but we're not God.\" He added: \"This one failure should not make us look totally incompetent. Look at our track record. For the last 10 years, we have captured Taliban and al-Qaeda in their hundreds - more than any other countries put together.\" The compound is about a kilometre from the Pakistan Military Academy - the country's equivalent of West Point or Sandhurst. The ISI official also gave new or differing accounts of some of the events of Sunday's raid. They included: The official said it was thought the Americans wanted to take away the surviving women and children but had to abandon the plan when one of the helicopters malfunctioned. By Owen Bennett-JonesBBC News, Islamabad Clearly there were people helping Bin Laden in this location.... were they state employees, were they simply from Taliban-related groups, were they from the intelligence agencies? For all Americans may ask the questions, I doubt they will get any answers. There will be ambiguity about this and the Pakistanis will deny they had any knowledge whatsoever. The establishment here is made up of army leadership, intelligence agency leadership and some senior civil servants, and they have always run Pakistan, whether democratic governments or military governments, and those people do have connections with jihadis. The difficulty the West has is in appreciating there are more than 20 different types of jihadi organisations, and al-Qaeda is just one of them. The state has different policies towards different types of group and that subtlety is often lost on Western policy-makers. The helicopter was destroyed by the special forces unit. The US has not commented on anyone it captured or had planned to capture, other than saying it had taken Bin Laden's body. The ISI official said the organisation had recovered some documents from the compound. The CIA is already said to be going through a large number of hard drives and storage devices seized in the raid. The White House has not disclosed whether anyone has claimed the 25m (PS15m) reward for leading the US to Bin Laden. White House counter-terrorism adviser John Brennan said there had been concern Pakistani forces would deploy to counter the US Navy Seal team conducting the raid but it had avoided any confrontation. The ISI official said: \"We were totally caught by surprise. They were in and out before we could react.\" Our correspondent says residents near the compound in Abbottabad reported that Pakistani soldiers had asked them to switch off their lights an hour before the attack, but the ISI official said this was not true and that it had no advance knowledge of the raid. Earlier, in an opinion piece in the Washington Post, President Asif Ali Zardari admitted Bin Laden \"was not anywhere we had anticipated he would be.\" But he denied the killing suggested Pakistan was failing in its efforts to tackle terrorism. Mr Zardari said Pakistan had \"never been and never will be the hotbed of fanaticism that is often described by the media.\" \"Such baseless speculation may make exciting cable news, but it doesn't reflect fact,\" he said. \"Pakistan had as much reason to despise al-Qaeda as any nation. The war on terrorism is as much Pakistan's war as it is America's.\" Mr Brennan had said it was \"inconceivable that Bin Laden did not have a support system\" in Pakistan. He estimated Bin Laden had been living in the compound in Abbottabad for five or six years. Pakistani Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir tried to draw a line under the matter, saying: \"Who did what is beside the point.... This issue of Osama Bin Laden is history.\" Bin Laden was America's most wanted man but had eluded capture for more than a decade. US officials say that after DNA tests they are \"99.9\" sure that the man they shot and killed and later buried at sea was Bin Laden. US President Barack Obama watched the entire operation in real time in the White House with his national security team. Mr Brennan said: \"The minutes passed like days.\" CIA director Leon Panetta narrated via a video screen from a separate Washington office, with Bin Laden given the code name Geronimo. Mr Panetta's narration lasted several minutes. \"They've reached the target.... We have a visual on Geronimo.... Geronimo EKIA (enemy killed in action).\" Mr Obama said: \"We got him.\" Bin Laden, his son Khalid, trusted personal courier Sheikh Abu Ahmed and the courier's brother were all killed, along with an unidentified woman. Bin Laden was shot above his left eye, blowing away a section of his skull, and was also shot in the chest. The BBC's Andrew North in Washington says the White House is still discussing whether to release a video that was made of Bin Laden's burial from an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, which some Islamic scholars have said did not conform with tradition.

It is an opportunity we can not give to waste. `` Michael D Higgins , the president of Ireland , said : `` His ministering of the net rites to the two British corporals brutally killed in 1988 offered us an image of decency struggling to assert itself amidst brutality. `` There were tears and protection in west Belfast as news broke of the death of Fr Alec Reid. `` He should have got a Nobel Peace pillage , '' said one man. `` But mayhap he turned it down. The only prize he wanted comprise peace. `` One elderly woman , pull streaming down her face , said : `` He should be remembered with respect. `` He was mortal who children should aspire to be like. `` Fr Reid 's funeral will take place at 12:00 greenwich time on Wednesday after requiem Mass in Clonard church in west Belfast.

But Mr Johnson entirely failed to persuade other countries to agree. Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano said there was no consensus new sanctions would help and argued they could push Russia into a corner. Mr Johnson's own view of the Syrian conflict seems to have swerved around like a shopping trolley since he became the UK's chief diplomat in July. Giving evidence to a House of Lords committee at the start of 2017, he signalled a shift in UK policy towards Syria. Mr Johnson said the \"mantra\" of calling for President Assad to go had not worked and the military space had been left open to Russia to fill. The Foreign Secretary told peers President Assad should be allowed to run for election as part of a \"democratic resolution\" of the civil war. Now, however, Mr Johnson believes the Syrian leader has to go. How much of this is fair? And what might the episode say about Boris Johnson's standing in Theresa May's government? First, the UK was a bystander to the Trump administration's missile strike on Syria. The government was given a courtesy call to say it was coming but the UK was not asked to be involved. Mr Johnson's trip to Moscow (which would have been the first by a British foreign secretary to Russia for five years) was long planned and quickly binned. I understand Mrs May told Mr Johnson it was his call whether he wanted to go or not. After speaking to Rex Tillerson, Mr Johnson and his US opposite number agreed it was best for one man to deliver a single message to Moscow. Mr Johnson then spent a weekend hitting the phones to other G7 countries trying to get a united position agreed ahead of the meeting in Lucca. In its final communique, the G7 did agree to state the Assad regime had to end. But further sanctions - an idea endorsed by Number 10 - got nowhere. It was clearly a snub to Mr Johnson although government sources insist sanctions have not been taken off the table. On Wednesday, the Chancellor, Phillip Hammond, said other countries were \"less forward-leaning\" than the UK on the issue. Diplomacy is tough. But it may have been unwise for the Foreign Office to suggest sanctions were an ambition when key G7 nations clearly didn't agree. At the weekend, I was told by Team Boris that he was very relaxed about the sniping and criticism being lobbed his way in recent days.

Mr Johnson is always keen to speak with the swashbuckling pluck of the newspaper columnist he once was. His many fans in the Tory party might love it. But even Mrs May has hinted at exasperation.

{"original_text": "Every owner of a gadget piloted via a touchscreen has spent time rubbing it with a tissue, a cloth or a sleeve gripped round the heel of the hand to banish those unsightly marks. It's not that human fingers are filthy. Those smears come about thanks to a mix of physiology and good grooming habits, said Steve Block, an electronics industry scientist at Dow Corning, which makes coatings that get applied to touchable screens. \"There's a whole range of things that can contaminate those surfaces,\" he said. \"There are natural oils on the fingers as well as the lotions people put their hands. Then there's cosmetics and the times when you hold your telephone up to your ear and it's sweaty.\" Small wonder then that the sight of those smears is unsettling. Thankfully, there is no reason to fret, as those smears are safe if your touchscreen gadget is kept just for you, said Prof Charles Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona. \"Touchscreens are a source of a wide range of microbes, but not much of an issue if you do not share it among other people - since, if you are the only one using it, it's only your germs,\" he told the BBC. Sadly, that is not the case when those touchscreens are put to more promiscuous use, such as in a supermarket at the self-checkout, by patients in a doctor's waiting room or in a family that passes the gadget around. Studies by Prof Gerba and colleagues have shown how important an infection vector touchscreens can be when used by lots of people. \"We have traced the spread of MRSA skin infection among teenagers that shared a cell phone,\" he said. \"You will find MRSA on touchscreens on self-checkout screens in grocery stores in the US.\" Touchscreens can be \"reservoirs of opportunistic pathogens,\" said Prof Gerba in a small-scale study that uncovered MRSA, E. coli and C. difficile and many others on screens in hospitals and supermarkets. It is worth keeping those surfaces clean, said Prof Gerba, even if the chances of getting ill are pretty low. \"For viruses it can take as little one to make you ill, but this varies a lot depending on the organisms. Some bacteria take 100,000 cells to cause illness, others a few hundred,\" he said. \"It just depends if you come across the right organisms at the right time.\" The study was carried out to test the best way of keeping those screens clean and killing off the bad bugs. The good news is that wipes impregnated with sodium hypochlorite (bleach), did a good job of disinfecting the screens. However, regularly wiping with bleach might not be a solution that domestic owners of very shiny, very expensive gadgets would favour. Thankfully, other fixes are at hand. To begin with, said Mr Block, screen makers are constantly refining the materials and coatings that make gadgets easy to wipe and keep clean. Those transparent coverings are glass, he said, but of a very particular type. Typically, he said, they and the coatings covering them are engineered to the most minute scale. \"They are made of very specialised molecules that are designed for these type of applications,\" said Mr Block. The silicone coatings that are now becoming standard are far more resistant to the secretions and substances that can end up on a touchscreen. Also, said Mr Block, they are tougher and ensure a screen will stay responsive years after it is bought. There are other innovations that might help too. Japanese materials company Toray has come up with a coating that, it claims, repels up to 50 more of the oil and other residues found on fingers. In addition, once applied, the coating dries into millions of tiny wrinkles that help hide smudges to help screens stay sharp. The fourth generation of Gorilla Glass, which is used on many touchscreen gadgets, will include an antibacterial coating that can kill those pesky bugs by themselves. That coating is likely to start being used within the next couple of years. Then there is the work of scientists at Harvard University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, who turned to a carnivorous plant to develop their screen coating. They found that the walls of the pitcher plant are slippery because they are covered with tiny bumps that trap water. Insects that can easily walk on walls struggle to make any progress on this surface because it repels the oils on their feet. By mimicking this surface and applying an ultra-thin layer of lubricant, the researchers created a surface inimical to bodily substances. The work is still in the lab but is more evidence that those screens are only going to get harder to smear and easier to use. \"Any dirt is a barrier between user experience and a display,\" said Mr Block.", "text_perturb": "Every possessor of a gadget piloted via a touchscreen has spent time rubbing it with a tissue , a cloth or a sleeve gripped round the heel of the hand to banish those unsightly marks.

Thankfully , there is no reason to fret , as those smears are safe if your touchscreen gadget is kept just for you , said professor Charles Gerba , a microbiologist at the University of Arizona. `` Touchscreens are a source of a wide range of microbes , but not a great deal of an issue if you do not share it among other people - since , if you are the only one using it , it 's only your germs , '' he told the BBC. Sadly , that is not the case when those touchscreens are put to more promiscuous use , such as in a supermarket at the self-checkout , by patients in a doctor 's waiting elbow room or in a family that passes the gadget around. Studies by Prof Gerba and colleagues hold shown how important an infection vector touchscreens can be when used by lots of people. `` We have traced the spread of MRSA skin contagion among teenagers that shared a cell phone , '' he said. `` You will find oneself MRSA on touchscreens on self-checkout screens in grocery stores in the US. `` Touchscreens can be `` reservoirs of opportunistic pathogen , '' said Prof Gerba in a small-scale study that uncovered MRSA , E. coli and C. difficile and many others on screens in hospital and supermarkets. It is deserving keeping those surfaces clean , said Prof Gerba , even if the chances of getting ill are pretty low. `` For viruses it dismiss take as little one to make you ill , but this varies a lot depending on the organisms. Some bacteria take 100,000 cells to cause illness , others a few hundred , '' he pronounce. `` It just depends if you come across the right organisms at the right prison term. `` The study was carried out to test the best way of keeping those screens clean and bolt down off the bad bugs. The good news is that wipes impregnated with na hypochlorite ( bleach ) , did a good job of disinfecting the screens. notwithstanding , regularly wiping with bleach might not be a solution that domestic owners of very shiny , very expensive gadgets would favour. Thankfully , other fixes are at handwriting. To begin with , said Mr Block , screen makers are constantly refining the materials and coatings that make gadgets easygoing to wipe and keep clean. Those transparent coverings are glass , he said , but of a very particular case. Typically , he said , they and the coatings covering them be engineered to the most minute scale. `` They are made of really specialised molecules that are designed for these type of applications , '' said Mr Block. The silicone coatings that are now becoming standard are far more resistant to the secernment and substances that can end up on a touchscreen. Also , said Mr Block , they are tougher and ensure a screen will stay responsive years after it is purchase. There are other design that might help too. Japanese materials company Toray has come up with a coating that , it claims , repels up to 50 more of the oil and other residues find out on fingers. In addition , once applied , the coating dries into millions of tiny wrinkles that help shroud smudges to help screens stay sharp. The fourth generation of Gorilla Glass , which make up used on many touchscreen gadgets , will include an antibacterial coating that can kill those pesky bugs by themselves. That coating is likely to start being used within the future couple of years. Then there is the work of scientists at harvard university University 's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences , who turned to a carnivorous plant to develop their screen coating. They found that the walls of the pitcher plant are slippery because they are covered with tiny blow that trap water. insect that can easily walk on walls struggle to make any progress on this surface because it repels the oils on their feet. By mimicking this surface and applying an ultra-thin layer of lubricant , the researchers create a surface inimical to bodily substances. The work equal still in the lab but equal more evidence that those screens are only going to get harder to smear and easier to use. `` Any dirt is a barrier between user experience and a display , '' allege Mr Block.

{"original_text": "They talk of a boy who dressed smartly and worked hard, but who barely said a word during his time at school. Police officers have said he may have had a personality or developmental disorder, while one relative told ABC News he was \"obviously not well.\" Lanza appears to have kept a low profile throughout his life. US media report that unusually, his high school yearbook of 2010 contained no photograph of him. \"Camera shy\" was the comment by his entry. Unlike the majority of his peers, Lanza apparently had no Facebook page. His online footprint was minimal. He appears not to have been known to the police. Adam Lanza lived with his mother in a well-to-do neighbourhood of Newtown, Connecticut. The house is about five miles (8km) from Sandy Hook School, which he attended as a child. He went on to Newtown High School, but made few friends. His mother pulled him out of the school and taught him at home because she was unhappy with the school district's plan for his education.

But he was a very bright boy, he was smart,\" she said. Intelligent but shy and nervous were the most common memories of those who learnt beside him. Richard Novia, who was head of security at Newtown High School, said it was clear Lanza had \"some disabilities.\" He was protective of his personal space and sometimes appeared to completely withdraw into himself or to \"take flight,\" Mr Novia told AP, meaning his mother had to be called in to resolve the problem. \"You had yourself a very scared young boy, who was very nervous around people he could trust or he refused to speak with.\" Mr Novia helped to run a technology club, which Lanza attended, and said he had to keep a close eye on him while the club was using soldering equipment or electrical equipment. \"If that boy would've burned himself, he would not have known it or felt it physically,\" he said.

I was really proud of. `` Our game management was good as was our defensive effort plus we kicked the ball at the proper time. `` We entirely gave away six penalties in the entire game so when you do that you have a lot of energy. The players kept turning up for each other and defended repeat sets on our line of business. It stimulate given us something to build on. `` Salford coach Ian Watson : `` People will turn a loss their shirt on that performance today. It personify disappointing. The first half we were way below the measure we have set ourselves physically. `` Leigh were dominant - their pack was on the front foot and their half-backs were capable to control the game on the back of that. `` `` Our performances have dipped and there 's been a drop in loudness since we secured a top-eight finish. `` What we need to do now is realise what we were doing before and rediscover the hunger and attitude we showed before in the season which was winning us games. `` For Leigh to score 18 dot in that first half in those conditions put them on the front foot. `` Leigh : McNally , Dawson , Crooks , Langi , Brown , Mortimer , Drinkwater , hock joint , Higham , Maria , Paterson , Vea , Burr.

Mr Nassar, 53, is accused by more than 60 former patients and athletes of sexual abuse during pelvic procedures. He is facing separate federal charges for possession of child pornography. After testimony at a court in Mason, Michigan, Judge Donald Allen ordered Mr Nassar to stand trial on three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a person under 13 years old. The accused, a sports doctor who treated US Olympic gymnasts, faces up to life in prison if convicted. He was stripped of his medical licence last month, amid at least six criminal and civil lawsuits. The unnamed woman, who was neither a patient nor an athlete, testified against him for more than two hours on Friday. She detailed how Mr Nassar allegedly molested her during family visits to his home in Holt, Michigan, from 1998 to 2005. \"Almost every time I was there for a couple of years, something occurred,\" she told the court. Some of the abuse happened under a blanket as he sat next to her on the sofa, while her unwitting older brother sat nearby, she said. When she tried to tell her parents about the molestation, they did not believe her. \"They made me feel like I had done something terrible,\" she said, adding that they told her to apologise to the doctor. She refused. When the woman left home for university, she again told her parents about her experience with Mr Nassar.

The Stirling University academics behind the report called for a \"retail revolution\" to help people choose healthier options. However, the study was criticised by the Scottish Grocers' Federation. It said the report failed to take account of the efforts already being made to promote healthy eating. Food Standards Scotland (FSS) said Scottish obesity levels, currently 30, were projected to rise to 40 by 2030. Professor Leigh Sparks, who wrote the report, told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that there was an imbalance in the type of food promoted in shops. \"If you look at the environment in store in retailing, then most of the promotions are pushing the products that are less healthy for consumers,\" he said. \"A lot of the products have been supersized as well - boxes of crisps, bags of crisps are good examples of that.\" He said that manufacturers needed to make changes to the composition of their products, while retailers should provide more information for consumers and change their \"balance of promotions.\" \"I think retailers are increasingly aware of the issue and they're looking at what they can do,\" he added. \"But most of the voluntary schemes that have gone on so far have not had the impact because of this overwhelming tide in terms of unhealthy promotions as well.\" The report also backs the idea of a sugar tax. FSS senior dietary adviser Dr Gillian Purdon said: \"The report supports Food Standards Scotland views and recommendations for the need to extend sugar tax beyond soft drinks, to reformulate products to reduce sugar fat and salt, to resize portions, address less healthy food promotion and to provide clearer consumer information on products in both the retail and out of home sectors. \"This report will help us to develop new approaches to improve the balance of food offered and promoted by the retail sector. \"It is clear that a combination of measures will be needed overall to enable healthier eating. Regulation of promotions of high fat, salt andor sugar food and drink within retail stores and out of home premises should be taken forward as a priority.\" Previous research by FSS indicated about 50 of less healthy food choices are purchased on promotions. For healthier foods, the figure is about 30. The report added: \"We conclude that the current context for consumer choice in-store is affecting the health and diet of consumers in Scotland. \"Voluntary and self-regulatory approaches or relying on consumers to make'good' decisions are not having sufficient impact. \"It will thus be necessary to regulate to make the changes have real impact.\" Dr John Lee, of the Scottish Grocers' Federation, which represents food retailers in Scotland, said: \"This report seems to ignore the significant efforts of retailers to actively promote healthy products in-store and the efforts of manufacturers to reformulate products and reduce calories. \"Additionally, extending the sugar tax will make no real or lasting impact on diet-related problems.

But under new European regulations, supported by Britain's Food Standards Agency (FSA), they will have to rely on visual checks alone. The FSA says the new system avoids the risk of harmful bacteria being spread. Around eight million pigs a year are slaughtered for meat in the UK. Ron Spellman, a British meat inspector with 30 years' experience, says the new regulations, which took effect from 1 June, risk diseased parts of animals going undetected. Listen to Allan Urry's report on File on Four on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 BST on Tuesday 17 June, or catch up on the BBC iPlayer Mr Spellman, who is director general of the European Working community for Food inspectors and Consumer protection (EWFC), which represents meat inspectors across the EU, said: \"Last year we know that there were at least 37,000 pigs' heads with abscesses or tuberculosis lesions in lymph nodes in the head. They won't be cut now. \"There's no way to see those little abscesses, little tuberculosis lesions without cutting those lymph nodes.\" Meat from pigs' heads, is recovered by specialised parts of boning plants and goes into pies, sausages and other processed foods. The new regulations have been drawn up by the European Food Safety Authority, an agency funded by the EU, but they are based on scientific advice from the FSA. The FSA's chief operating officer Andrew Rhodes told the BBC it was better to have a hands-off system using visual checks to reduce cross-contamination, because bugs like E. coli and campylobacter are causing scientists more concern. He said: \"The risks to the consumers are increasingly from microbiological and pathogenic hazards and that's what we must control. \"We cannot simply ignore the risks that are brought by touching, cutting and handling products that are later going to go on to be cooked and eaten, we have to do this properly.\" But the FSA's support for the new measures puts them at odds with many of their own frontline staff, the 1,100 meat inspectors who check safety standards in Britain's 350 slaughterhouses and in meat-cutting plants which process carcasses. Some in the slaughtering industry are also opposing the changes. Kevin Burrows, of C and K Meats, owns an abattoir in Suffolk whose main business is pork.

Seventh in the National last year, he is one of four runners trained by David Pipe, and is about a 10-1 chance along with Definitly Red, an impressive winner at Doncaster last month for Brian Ellison.

{"original_text": "Each evening Cardiff Bay will become the venue for a world music Showcase Festival featuring a tapas of world music from around the world. Folk music played a large part in this year's opening ceremony featuring Cerys Matthews and other leading Welsh musicians taking the audience on a journey of Welsh music and culture spanning 30,000 years. We asked ten of the leading exponents of Wales' folk music to share songs that best represent what makes each tradition so unique. The earliest surviving manuscript of harp music in Europe - the manuscript of Robert ap Huw, comes from Wales. \"The tablature of the Ap Huw manuscripts provide a vital insight into early, traditional music and his music is still celebrated and performed widely\" said internationally renowned harpist, Catrin Finch. \"Caniad Y Gwyn Bibydd\" (The Song of the White Piper) demonstrates his music's amazing ability to sound contemporary, even though it was written nearly five centuries ago.\" This unique tradition of singing or chanting poetry to harp accompaniment is a direct descendent of the form used by early bards to intone poetry in praise of their kings and princes. Gwenan Gibard, a musician and leading exponent of the tradition chose the track Bum Yn Caru Cainc Y Datgeiniad by one of the old style singers, Einion Edwards, from Meirionydd - a stronghold of the tradition for centuries. Considered by many to be Wales's national instrument, the triple harp was brought to Britain from continental Europe in around 1630. It became popular with harpists in London, many of whom were Welsh and brought it to Wales where it became popular amongst the Gipsy community. \"The'shimmering' voice of the Triple Harp's three rows of strings is truly as timeless and unique as the Welsh language itself\" said Robin Huw Bowen, a full-time professional Welsh harpist specializing solely in the Welsh Triple Harp. The track Pwt Ar Y Bys (Fingering Vamp) shows off the harp's capability and the Welsh tradition to great effect. In many parts of Wales Christmas Day meant attending an early plygain service between 3-6am at the parish church. Singer Arfon Gwilym was brought up in the tradition and explains more: \"The plygain tradition survives mainly in Montgomeryshire and takes place in churches and chapels over a six week period during Christmas and the new year.\" \"After a short service, the plygain is declared open and anyone in the audience can take part, as individuals or as small parties, the most common party being three people, singing in close harmony. The singing is always unaccompanied and in the past was dominated by men who sang in a simple folk style that was unique.\" Listen to Ar Gyfer Heddiw'r Bore by Triawd Fronheulog. Welsh ballads are still widely performed in their traditional forms but new generations of musicians are revisiting them and performing the songs in more contemporary styles, ensuring they remain relevant. In recent years, folk singer Sian James has been at the forefront of this movement: \"A ballad which caught my imagination from a very young age was the very beautiful Yr Eneth gadd ei gwrthod (The rejected maiden) - a 19th Century ballad from the Cynwyd area near Bala, which tells the story of a young girl who, finding herself pregnant out of wedlock, is thrown out of her family home by her father, ostracised by her community and left destitute.\" \"It ends with the girl drowning herself. She is found with a water-sodden note in her hand, asking to be buried without a headstone, so her existence would be forgotten.\" Due to the work of enlightened individuals such as Lady Llanover in the 18th Century, a good many of Wales' traditional dance reels (folk dance and accompanying dance tune type) have survived. Stephen Rees is one of Wales's leading folk musicians and musicologists: \"This recording of Pibddawns y Sipsi performed by Nansi Richards, the original'Queen of the Welsh Harp' conveys the'hwyl' or spirit of our traditional dance music.\" During the Industrial Revolution, migrant workers from across the world flocked to Wales' coalfields, slate quarries and docks. The impact on small, Welsh speaking communities was immense and this period ignited a tradition of mixed language songs known as Macaronic. Cerys Matthews is a huge fan and chose Can Merthyr as one of her favourites. Initially, Macaronic songs were thought to be an oral tradition but handwritten records do exist in the National Library of Wales archives dated 1909. Its words are said to have been sold on the pamphlet of a ballad-singer at Merthyr Tydfil around the mid-19th Century. The 1960s and 1970s saw a surge in Welsh language activism. While the rest of the western world was engaged in the hippy movement and the'summer of love', Wales was rediscovering its folk music and traditions, fuelled by a surge in the popularity of Celtic music. \"We formed Ar Log in 1976, with the dream of being able to earn a living solely by playing traditional Welsh music\" said Dafydd Roberts, one of the founding members of Ar Log. \"By the early eighties Ar Log was travelling Europe and North South America for around nine months of the year with a wealth of traditional Welsh folk music at our disposal, from haunting love songs and harp airs, to melodic dance tunes, and rousing sea shanties.\" This medley of traditional folk songs comes from Ar Log's own repertoire: Twll yn y to Cymro o Ble Pedwar Post y Gwely Dafydd Iwan is a singer-composer and political activist and campaigned during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s for official status for the Welsh language with Cymdeithas Yr Iaith, the Welsh Language Movement. \"Songs have been a natural medium for expressing strong emotions and political protest for centuries, and here in Wales there is a long tradition of ballads with a strong social and political theme,\" he said. Peintio'r Byd Yn Wyrdd (Painting the world green) grew out of the road-signs campaign for the Welsh language. More and more young musicians are turning to the folk tradition for inspiration and helping to drive creative experimentation and collaborations. Welsh poet and singer-songwriter Gwyneth Glyn has recently been working on such a project with musicians from India and singer Tauseef Akhrar from Mumbai and incorporates Indian violin, tabla and Welsh harp. Another recent project entitled Mamiaith (Mother Tongue), saw Welsh folk group 9Bach collaborate with Australian group Black Arm Band to explore the poignant theme of lost language.

Folk music work a large part in this year 's opening ceremony featuring Cerys Matthews and other leading Welsh musicians taking the audience on a journey of Welsh music and culture spanning 30,000 years. We asked ten of the leading exponents of Wales ' folk music to share songs that best represent what makes each tradition and then unique. The earliest surviving ms of harp music in Europe - the ms of Robert ap Huw , comes from Wales. `` The tablature of the Ap Huw manuscripts provide a lively insight into early , traditional music and his music is still celebrated and performed widely '' said internationally renowned harpist , Catrin Finch. `` Caniad Y Gwyn Bibydd '' ( The Song of the White Piper ) demonstrates his music 's amazing ability to sound contemporary , even though it was spell nearly five centuries ago. `` This unique tradition of singing or chanting poetry to harp complement is a direct descendent of the form used by early bards to intone poetry in praise of their kings and princes. Gwenan Gibard , a musician and leading exponent of the custom chose the track Bum Yn Caru Cainc Y Datgeiniad by one of the old style singers , Einion Edwards , from Meirionydd - a stronghold of the custom for centuries. Considered by many to represent Wales 's national instrument , the triple harp was brought to Britain from continental Europe in around 1630. It became popular with harpists in british capital , many of whom were Welsh and brought it to Wales where it became popular amongst the Gipsy community. `` The'shimmering ' voice of the Triple Harp 's three rows of strings is truly as timeless and unique as the cymry language itself '' said Robin Huw Bowen , a full-time professional cymry harpist specializing solely in the cymry Triple Harp. The track Pwt Ar Y Bys ( Fingering Vamp ) shows off the harp 's capacity and the Welsh tradition to great effect. In many parts of Wales Christmas day meant attending an early plygain service between 3-6am at the parish church. Singer Arfon Gwilym was fetch up in the tradition and explains more : `` The plygain tradition survives mainly in Montgomeryshire and takes place in churches and chapels over a six week period during Christmas and the new year. `` `` After a short service , the plygain embody declared open and anyone in the audience can take part , as individuals or as small parties , the most common party being three people , singing in close harmony. The singing is always unaccompanied and in the past times was dominated by men who sang in a simple folk style that was unique. `` Listen to ar Gyfer Heddiw ' r Bore by Triawd Fronheulog. Welsh ballads are still widely performed in their traditional forms but new generations of musicians are revisiting them and performing the songs in more than contemporary styles , ensuring they remain relevant. In late years , folk singer Sian James has been at the forefront of this movement : `` A ballad which caught my imagination from a very young age was the very beautiful Yr Eneth gadd ei gwrthod ( The rejected maiden ) - a 19th Century ballad from the Cynwyd area near Bala , which tells the story of a young girl who , finding herself pregnant out of wedlock , is thrown out of her family home by her father , ostracised by her community and left destitute. `` `` It ends with the girl submerge herself. She is found with a water-sodden note in her hand , involve to be buried without a headstone , so her existence would be forgotten. `` Due to the work of enlightened individuals such as lady Llanover in the 18th Century , a good many of Wales ' traditional dance reels ( folk dance and accompanying dance tune type ) have survived. Stephen Rees is one of Wales 's leading folk musicians and musicologists : `` This recording of Pibddawns y Sipsi execute by Nansi Richards , the original'Queen of the Welsh Harp ' conveys the'hwyl ' or spirit of our traditional dance music. `` During the Industrial Revolution , migrant workers from across the world flocked to Wales ' coalfields , ticket quarries and docks. The impact on small , Welsh speaking communities was immense and this period ignited a custom of mixed language songs known as Macaronic. Cerys Matthews is a huge fan and chose Can Merthyr as one of her darling. Initially , Macaronic songs were thought to be an oral tradition but handwritten records behave exist in the National Library of Wales archives dated 1909. Its words equal said to have been sold on the pamphlet of a ballad-singer at Merthyr Tydfil around the mid-19th Century. The 1960s and 1970s saw a spate in Welsh language activism. While the rest of the western world cost engaged in the hippy movement and the'summer of love ' , Wales cost rediscovering its folk music and traditions , fuelled by a surge in the popularity of Celtic music. `` We formed Ar Log in 1976 , with the dream of being able to earn a livelihood solely by playing traditional Welsh music '' said Dafydd Roberts , one of the founding members of Ar Log. `` By the early eighties Ar Log was travelling Europe and North South America for around nine months of the year with a wealth of traditional Welsh folk music at our garbage disposal , from haunting love songs and harp airs , to melodic dance tunes , and rousing sea shanties. `` This medley of traditional folk songs comes from Ar Log 's own repertoire : Twll yn y to Cymro o Ble Pedwar Post y Gwely Dafydd Iwan is a singer-composer and political activist and campaigned during the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s for official status for the welsh black language with Cymdeithas Yr Iaith , the welsh black Language Movement. `` Songs have been a natural medium for expressing strong emotions and political protestation for centuries , and here in Wales there is a long tradition of ballads with a strong social and political theme , '' he said. Peintio ' radius Byd Yn Wyrdd ( Painting the world green ) grew out of the road-signs campaign for the Welsh language. More and more young musicians are turning to the folk tradition for inspiration and assist to drive creative experimentation and collaborations. Welsh poet and singer-songwriter Gwyneth Glyn stimulate recently been working on such a project with musicians from India and singer Tauseef Akhrar from Mumbai and incorporates Indian violin , tabla and Welsh harp. Another recent project entitled Mamiaith ( Mother Tongue ) , saw Welsh folk group 9Bach collaborate with Australian group Black Arm Band to search the poignant theme of lost language. Gwyneth chose the track Cariad Mam ( Mother 's love life ) from that album. Today , musical tradition in Wales is thriving as younger musicians turn to folk music for inspiration but continue to develop it further with rich musical collaboration around the world.

Debris from Karam's car hit ex-Formula 1 driver Wilson, 37, and the Andretti Autosport driver crashed into a wall. IndyCar officials said his death was a \"monumentally sad day.\" Mark Miles, chief executive of IndyCar parent company Hulman Co, said: \"Justin's elite ability to drive a race car was matched by his unwavering kindness, character and humility - which is what made him one of the most respected members of the paddock. \"As we know, the racing industry is one big family, and our efforts moving forward will be focused on rallying around Justin's family to ensure they get the support they need during this unbelievably difficult time.\" A seven-time IndyCar race winner, Wilson, from Sheffield, is survived by his wife, Julia, and two daughters. In a statement his family said he was a \"loving father and devoted husband, as well as a highly competitive racing driver who was respected by his peers.\" His brother Stefan, also a racing driver, paid tribute on social media, saying: \"Can't even begin to describe the loss I feel right now.

He finished second in the previous IndyCar race in Mid-Ohio on 2 August, his first podium finish since 2013, while his final victory came at the Firestone 550 at Texas Motor Speedway in June 2012. His appearance at the triangle-shaped Pocono Raceway was only his sixth of this season as he struggled to find a full-time seat. In the past 20 years there have been seven deaths during race meetings in IndyCar, including in the series' previous incarnations as Champ Car and Indy Racing League. In that time one F1 driver has been killed - Wilson's death comes 38 days after Frenchman Jules Bianchi succumbed to the devastating injuries he sustained at last year's Japanese Grand Prix. Four years ago British driver and two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon lost his life aged 33 at the Las Vegas Indy 300. Wheldon was killed when his head hit a post in the fence at Las Vegas Motor Speedway after a crash involving 15 vehicles. His death triggered calls for further safety reviews, including suggestions that open-wheel racing be banned on high-speed, oval tracks, where tightly-packed cars reach speeds of 230mph. IndyCar officials have introduced several safety measures into the sport. This includes safer walls, collapsible barriers designed to cushion impact and the installation of trauma centres at race tracks. McLaren driver Jenson Button is one of many Formula 1 figures to have paid tribute to Wilson. \"I raced with Justin as far back as 1989 in karting and remember his smile was infectious,\" he tweeted. \"The motorsport world comes to a standstill once again. Justin Wilson was a great person and racing driver.

A lack of goals has been one of the Tractor Boys' main issues this campaign, with only Wigan and Rotherham scoring fewer, but striker McGoldrick ended a 15-game drought to set the ball rolling.

The Blues responded well to falling two-goals behind but Karen Carney's deflected shot was turned on to a post by Sari Van Veenendaal, and bounced back across the face of goal and clear. After the break, Arsenal made the win safe with Scott's powerful finish, before Linnett's well-struck consolation. In a bad-tempered second half, Carter drilled wide after a superb knock-down from Jordan Nobbs late on, but a two-goal cushion was sufficient to see Arsenal through. Arsenal manager Pedro Martinez Losa told BBC Sport: \"We have been starting games well.

Spa-Francorchamps is more usually associated with unpredictable and often wet weather, even in August, but this weekend has been baking, with temperatures in the low 30Cs.

{"original_text": "Police have charged a 32-year-old Norwegian man over both attacks. The man dressed as a police officer was arrested on tiny Utoeya island after an hour-long shooting spree. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said many people were still looking for their children and had not so far been able to locate them. He was speaking after meeting victims and relatives with Norway's King Harald, Queen Sonja and Crown Prince Haakon in the town of Sundvollen near the island. Values attackedHome-grown plot?In pictures: Shock Mr Stoltenberg said he was \"deeply touched\" by the meetings. \"We will do whatever we can to give them as much support as possible,\" he said. Earlier he said that he was due to have been on Utoeya - \"a youth paradise turned into a hell\" - a few hours after the attack took place. The suspect is reported by local media to have had links with right-wing extremists. He has been named as Anders Behring Breivik. Police searched his Oslo apartment overnight and are questioning him. The BBC's Richard Galpin, near the island which is currently cordoned off by police, says that Norway has had problems with neo-Nazi groups in the past but the assumption was that such groups had been largely eliminated and did not pose a significant threat. Police say they are investigating whether the attacks were the work of one man or whether others helped. \"At Utoeya, the water is still being searched for more victims,\" deputy police chief Roger Andresen told reporters. \"We have no more information than.... what has been found on [his] own websites, which is that it goes towards the right and that it is, so to speak, Christian fundamentalist.\" By Richard GalpinBBC News, near Utoeya A search is going on not just on the island itself, but also in the waters around it because a lot of people tried to escape by jumping in the water and trying to swim away. Even as they did that, eyewitnesses say, the gunman opened fire on them. The chatter now is that it took the police an hour, if not an hour and a half, to actually get to the island. Of course that gave the gunman so much time to kill so many people. Also crucially, the police were throwing all their resources at the huge bomb attack which had just taken place in the centre of Oslo. But still, the question will be asked: Were there not police nearer to this area who could have moved in much more quickly? Local media report that police are investigating claims by witnesses that a second person was involved, apparently not disguised in a police uniform. A farm supply firm has confirmed selling six tonnes of fertiliser to Mr Breivik who is reported to have run a farming company. Speculation has been rife that fertiliser could have been used in the Oslo bomb.

Chris Jordan took 3-31 and Tom Curran - in only his second game - 2-22 to restrict the Proteas in their chase. AB de Villiers made 39 and Mangaliso Mosehle 36 off 22 balls but South Africa could manage only 162-7. England, returning to the venue of their Champions Trophy semi-final defeat by Pakistan, put in a professional performance to wrap up the series. Middlesex left-hander Malan, 29, made the highest score by an England player on T20 debut, beating Paul Collingwood's 46 in England's maiden match in this format in 2005. England, whose next white-ball series is not until September against West Indies, begin a four-Test series against South Africa on 6 July. It was a polished performance from England's bowlers, using the short ball to discomfort South Africa, and they were backed up by some strong fielding. Hampshire leg-spinner Mason Crane, who played in the opening T20 at Southampton, was put under pressure as de Villiers struck him for consecutive sixes. However, the 20-year-old showed admirable confidence as he continued to toss the ball up and was rewarded when he drew an error out of the tourists' skipper, who slapped the ball to Alex Hales on the deep square leg boundary. Crane rounded off his spell with a superb over, conceding only two runs as England turned the screw. The Proteas were lacklustre. Of the top six, only De Villiers and opener JJ Smuts (29) reached double figures and it took some big hitting from wicketkeeper Mosehle to push their total up. England's seamers were excellent, with Curran in particular showing a maturity at the end of the innings as he bowled full and straight. The result means the visitors have won only two of their six limited-overs matches on this tour. England captain Eoin Morgan chose to rest himself for the match, a decision that initially drew criticism given this was a must-win game for England, but big-hitting Malan adapted quickly to international cricket. Arriving at the crease after Jason Roy fell for eight, Malan left his first delivery but pulled the second ferociously into the stands for six. On a pitch tinged with green, he took on the short ball against the seamers. He did not let up against a change of pace, nonchalantly flicking leg-spinner Imran Tahir over his shoulder to bring up his half-century from 31 deliveries. Malan and Hales, who was struggling to run after edging the ball on to his knee, put on 105 in 10.3 overs. When Malan finally fell, caught at long-on off Tahir, stand-in captain Jos Buttler struck two flat sixes to push England above 180.

{"original_text": "For most of US history, party nominees have been decided by political power brokers and deal-makers behind closed doors. Parties operate like private clubs - they make their own rules and are suspicious of outsiders. Only in recent history has a more open system of primaries and caucuses been grafted onto the process to give the average American a say in who appears on the general election ballot. In a close, contentious primary season, however, the veneer of accountability can rub off, exposing the sometimes unsightly gears that still power the US political system. This has prompted objection from the supporters of two candidates in particular - Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders - who feel that the party establishments are arrayed against their presidential quests. But are their concerns valid? Here are answers to four pertinent questions as the nomination battles approach its final months. 34 Number of delegates Ted Cruz received in Colorado, which held conventions to pick delegates 759 Trump total delegate count 529 Cruz total delegate count Mr Trump is leading the race for the Republican nomination, but it's starting to feel like he's not winning. While he's comfortably ahead, with 757 delegates to 529 for second-place Ted Cruz, there's mounting evidence that he's being outmanoeuvred in the behind-the-scenes political process that could come into play if he doesn't reach the magic 1,237 delegate number necessary to secure the nomination outright. In Colorado - which selected its delegates at party gatherings last week and not through primaries or caucuses - Mr Cruz walked away with all 34 delegates. Even in states that have held contests won by Mr Trump, Mr Cruz's team has been working doggedly to ensure that their people become delegates. While Mr Trump swept South Carolina's 50 delegates, for instance, the state's convention delegation will be riddled with Cruz supporters who, while bound to Mr Trump on the first few ballots, can switch to the Texas senator if there is a protracted convention battle. It has Mr Trump and his people crying foul. \"This is happening all over our country - great people being disenfranchised by politicians,\" Mr Trump tweeted on Monday. \"Repub party is in trouble!\" Paul Manafort, Mr Trump's new aide in charge of managing the delegate-selection process, accused the Cruz campaign of using \"Gestapo tactics, scorched-earth tactics\" in Colorado. If, as Mr Trump asserted on Monday, the system is \"rigged\" and \"crooked,\" however, it isn't always tilted in favour of Mr Trump's opponents. Thanks to the Republican Party's delegate-apportioning system, including Florida's winner-take-all primary, Mr Trump has secured a larger share of the delegates so far (45) than he has of the raw primary vote (37). If Mr Cruz manages to win the nomination at the Republican convention despite trailing Mr Trump in total delegates and share of the popular vote, Mr Trump may have reason to feel aggrieved. But before he complains too loudly, he might want to heed some sage advice attributed (incorrectly) to Albert Einstein: \"You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else.\" Mr Trump should be familiar with the quote, since he tweeted it in October 2014. 17 States Bernie Sanders has won 18 States Hillary Clinton has won Mr Sanders has won five state contests in a row and seven of the last eight. If he were an American football team he'd be poised for the playoffs. If he were prize fighter, he'd be tuning up for a title bout. Instead his pledged-delegate deficit to Mrs Clinton has gone from daunting to only fractionally less daunting. Over the course of his recent run, the Vermont Senator has picked up a net of just 91 delegates, despite winning Wisconsin 56 to 43, Utah 79 to 20 and Washington 72 to 27. According to a New York Times calculation, the former secretary of state currently has 1,305 pledged delegates, while Sanders stands at 1,086. Add in the non-binding support of \"super-delegates\" - Democratic officeholders and party functionaries who also cast ballots for the nominee at the convention - and Mrs Clinton's lead balloons to 1,774 to 1,117. To secure the Democratic nomination without drama at the convention a candidate needs the backing of 2,383 delegates The problem for Mr Sanders is that while he's been posting sizeable wins over the past month, they've largely been in delegate-poor states, like Wyoming (14 delegates), Idaho (23) and Alaska (16). His successes pale when compared to Mrs Clinton's massive earlier wins in populous southern states like Texas, Florida and Georgia, which alone netted her 184 delegates over Mr Sanders. If Mrs Clinton performs as expected in the coming contests in New York (291 delegates), Maryland (118) and Pennsylvania (210), she'll largely erase all the modest ground Mr Sanders made up over the past three weeks. 9,412,426 Votes for Hillary Clinton during primary season so far 7,034,997 Votes for Bernie Sanders during primary season so far If delegate maths and selection rules make your head hurt, at least we can rely on the raw vote totals to get a feel for how popular the remaining candidates are, right? Wrong. According to current tabulations Hillary Clinton has received 9,412,426 votes during the primary season so far. Bernie Sanders has received 7,034,997. That 2.4m vote lead has been relentlessly touted by the former secretary of state and her supporters to counter the claims of Sanders faithful that their man is more popular than the delegate tallies indicate. Some states that hold caucuses - like Iowa and Washington - aren't included in that number, however, because they don't report vote totals. The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler tried to extrapolate numbers for the remaining states based on their total voter turnout and concluded that Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by 2.3m votes - still a significant margin. Among the Republicans, who are better about providing full vote totals, Mr Trump leads with 8,256,309 votes. Mr Cruz is second (6,319,244), former candidate Marco Rubio is third (3,482,129), followed by Mr Kasich (2,979,379). In the end the popular vote may give the leading candidates a claim of legitimacy as the people's choice - but appearances can be deceiving. \"The media has created the perception that the voters choose the nomination. That's the conflict here,\" North Dakota delegate Curly Haugland told a television interviewer. \"The rules are still designed to have a political party choose its nominee at a convention. That's just the way it is.\" \"Well, there's the law, and then there's ethics, and then there's getting votes. I'm not going to get into what tactics are used.\" If, as appears to be increasingly likely, the Republican primary season ends without Donald Trump securing the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination, the Republican National Convention could turn into a political free-for-all unrivalled in modern US political history. After several rounds of deadlocked balloting, most convention delegates would be free to vote their conscience. But could that conscience be nudged by, say, a free weekend at a Donald Trump golf resort, a nice dinner with the Cruz family or even a choice spot in a John Kasich administration? Maybe! While there are detailed anti-corruption laws governing the behaviour of public officeholders, convention delegates are private citizens. While government regulations prohibit them from taking money from corporations, labour unions, government contractors or foreign nationals, the law beyond that is much murkier. Campaigns and their wealth donors could likely cover delegate travel expenses, no matter how lavish. Gold watches? Bags of small, unmarked bills? Who knows? State anti-bribery laws may apply, but there's scant legal precedent. Perhaps the greatest deterrent to untoward action by campaigns is the negative publicity such naked attempts at influence could have if they're documented. But public perceptions and attitudes this political season has been difficult to predict, to say the least. Although the national convention is still months away, accusations of dirty tricks have already started flying. On Sunday Mr Trump took to Twitter to accuse the Cruz campaign of misdeeds during the South Carolina state party convention - a charge Mr Cruz vehemently denied. \"I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign,\" Mr Trump wrote. \"Bad system!\" During a television interview that same morning, however, Trump adviser Paul Manafort appeared to acknowledge that his campaign won't be shy in wooing delegates at the national convention, however. \"Well, there's the law, and then there's ethics, and then there's getting votes,\" he said. \"I'm not going to get into what tactics are used. I happen to think the best way we're going to get delegates is to have Donald Trump be exposed to delegates, let the delegates hear what he says.\" Another Trump adviser, Barry Bennett, said they wouldn't be offering \"seats on the Trump airplane or anything like that.\" \"There's obviously a big line - we're not going to do anything immoral, illegal or unethical,\" he said. But when a presidential nomination is at stake, and it comes down to just a handful of delegates, that \"big line\" may end up looking awfully fuzzy.", "text_perturb": "For most of US history , party nominees have been decided by political power brokers and deal-makers behind shut doors. Parties operate like private clubs - they make their own rules and are mistrustful of outsiders. Only in recent history has a more open system of primary quill and caucuses been grafted onto the process to give the average American a say in who appears on the general election ballot. In a close , contentious primary season , however , the veneer of accountability can fret off , exposing the sometimes unsightly gears that still power the US political system. This has prompted objection from the supporters of two candidates in particular - Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders - who feel that the party establishments embody arrayed against their presidential quests. But are their business concern valid ? Here are answers to four pertinent questions as the nomination battles approach its final months. 34 Number of delegates Ted Cruz received in Colorado , which held conventions to pick delegates 759 Trump total delegate count 529 Cruz total delegate count Mr Trump is leading the race for the Republican nomination , but it 's starting to palpate like he 's not winning. While he 's comfortably ahead , with 757 delegates to 529 for second-place Ted Cruz , there 's mounting evidence that he 's being outmanoeuvred in the behind-the-scenes political process that could come into play if he does n't reach the magic 1,237 delegate figure necessary to secure the nomination outright. In Colorado - which selected its delegates at party gatherings last week and not through primaries or caucuses - mr Cruz walked away with all 34 delegates. Even in states that have held contests succeed by Mr Trump , Mr Cruz 's team has been working doggedly to ensure that their people become delegates. While Mr Trump swept South Carolina 's 50 delegates , for instance , the state 's convention delegation will be riddled with Cruz supporters who , while bound to Mr Trump on the first few ballots , can switch to the lone star state senator if there is a protracted convention battle. It has Mr Trump and his masses crying foul. `` This is happening all over our country - great people being disenfranchised by politicians , '' Mr Trump tweeted on monday. `` Repub party is in trouble !

{"original_text": "In the space of two months, the 25-year-old has become one of the most controversial politicians in Hong Kong - and is now pitted in a court battle against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments - even though she has admitted it could bankrupt her. Ms Yau and fellow party member Sixtus Leung won elections in September, gaining more than 55,000 votes between them. Ms Yau, a daughter of two civil servants, had little previous political experience, and made headlines for edging out a veteran politician to win a seat. The Chinese Studies graduate had been involved in the 2014 pro-democracy protests, when tens of thousands of people, including large numbers of students, took to the streets demanding fully democratic elections in Hong Kong. She describes the protests as an important part of her political awakening. After the movement failed to win any concessions from Beijing, Ms Yau and Mr Leung became involved in a new political party - Youngspiration - that campaigns against mainland China's influence on Hong Kong, and advocates a \"Hong Kong first\" approach. The party struck a nerve with many young Hong Kongers unhappy with China and disillusioned with traditional pro-democracy parties, who they argue have failed to achieve any reform. But, after their election victory, things quickly spiralled out of control. Ms Yau and Mr Leung sparked a furore when they were being sworn in last month. Instead of pledging allegiance to the \"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China,\" the duo swore allegiance to the \"Hong Kong nation,\" used a term considered derogatory towards China, and displayed a banner that read \"Hong Kong is not China.\" Their oaths were invalidated, and thousands of people protested against their actions, demanding they be removed from parliament. A top Chinese official even likened the duo to \"two cancer cells - if you don't care about it, it will continue to hurt your body.\" The Hong Kong government launched a court case to disqualify them. And the Chinese government also decided to intervene - issuing a controversial interpretation of Hong Kong's law on oath taking, to say that any oath that is not \"sincere\" should be automatically disqualified. After losing the court case, Ms Yau and Mr Leung were disqualified as legislators - and are now also bombarded with angry comments on social media, where people accuse them of being useless, politically naive, or insulting their country. But for all the controversy surrounding her, Ms Yau comes across as mild-mannered and determined in person - and less slick or media trained than many other politicians. \"We know that appealing the court decision will cost a lot,\" she says. \"We may face bankruptcy, but we have no choice.\" She is concerned that if the case is not challenged, it may set a legal precedent for other pro-independence legislators to be disqualified, which would allow the government to \"negate the results of a democratic vote.\" She says she believes in independence for Hong Kong because the \"One Country, Two Systems\" model under which it is governed, after it was handed back to China from the British in 1997, is \"a failed experiment.\" Despite the model, which promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, \"in these few years we have seen the PRC [People's Republic of China] government having direct interventions into the internal affairs of Hong Kong.\" \"We have to find another way to solve this problem,\" she says. \"One solution may be independence - or maybe we can find another kind of solution, but right now I can't think of any other solutions.\" It is true that there has been growing anger in Hong Kong at perceived Chinese involvement in its affairs. In particular, the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers who published books critical of mainland China in late 2015 sparked concerns over Hong Kong's future. But a majority of people in Hong Kong do not support independence - or think that calls for independence are part of the problem, not the solution. Hong Kong relies on China for much of its food and water supplies - as well as much of its trade - and the Chinese government has shown that it has zero tolerance for moves towards independence from any of its territories. The last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, supported democratic reform in Hong Kong - but recently said that independence for Hong Kong is \"something which is not going to happen.\" He has argued that the campaign for independence \"dilutes support for democracy and makes a mockery of a serious political argument,\" and that it would be \"a tragedy\" if the \"moral high ground\" of those seeking democracy was lost. Veteran democracy activist Martin Lee has even said he felt suspicious of Ms Yau and Mr Leung's actions, saying that they are \"giving [Beijing] the excuse\" to destroy Hong Kong's judicial independence. Some have even accused Ms Yau and Mr Leung of secretly working with Beijing to undermine Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. Ms Yau flatly denies this, and says her party has faced such accusations ever since it was founded. \"There are no external forces telling us what to do, to make long term plans, or betray Hong Kong.\" Looking amused, she adds: \"If we really were undercover agents, surely we'd still be in the legislative council - we wouldn't have let ourselves get kicked out, would we?\" Ms Yau is known for being outspoken. She supported gay marriage in her election campaign - despite receiving criticism for it - and also raised eyebrows when she said that Hong Kong's housing shortage meant that young people had \"no room to bang.\" But a lot of the comments about Ms Yau have focused on her gender and appearance, rather than her policies. One newspaper wrote articles about what she wore to rallies, highlighting what they called her \"protest look,\" while others nicknamed her \"goddess\" in reference to her appearance. And the sexism appears to have stepped up a notch since the oath-taking controversy. At one pro-Beijing protest, demonstrators stuck a photo of Ms Yau on a sex doll - and internet commentators have shared photos of Ms Yau's dress being hiked up during a scuffle in parliament. Ms Yau says she believes the sexist attacks are \"not because of my gender - it's because my ideology is different from theirs.\" However, experts have argued that the remarks are indicative of gender stereotyping in Hong Kong media - and worry that they could put off other women from entering politics. As for Ms Yau, she says she will continue to work to fulfil her campaign pledges - even if she loses her appeal and her seat in parliament. \"The fact is that many Hong Kongers take [independence] as an aim for the future of Hong Kong,\" and the government can't ignore those voices, she says. \"I hope in the future, Hong Kong people have the power to choose their destiny and the future they want - whatever it is they decide to choose.\" Additional reporting by BBC Chinese's Martin Yip", "text_perturb": "In the space of two months , the 25-year-old sustain become one of the most controversial politicians in Hong Kong - and is now pitted in a court battle against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments - even though she sustain admitted it could bankrupt her.

He persuades his friends that \"The miners are hated by Thatcher, the police, and the tabloid press...who does that remind you of?,\" adding \"The only thing we have to worry about which they don't is Mary Whitehouse, and that's only a matter of time\" Indeed, in real life it wasn't long until The Sun turned its moral indignation on the unlikely alliance as they branded a joint fundraising concert'Pits and Perverts'. But Mike quickly discovers that, in the beginning at least, not all the miners are entirely comfortable with the solidarity offered by'Lesbians and Gays Support Miners'.

Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: \"He was the absolute governor.\" A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners. At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: \"He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years. \"All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident. \"And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes. \"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.\" Evans described Sir Terry as his \"radio dad\" and said that Radio 2 was \"in disbelief and shock.\" \"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,\" added Evans. \"He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.\" BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry \"one of the greatest broadcasters of our age.\" \"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to'natural laziness'.

It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one. \"But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.\" Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a \"wonderful human being.\" \"I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh.

{"original_text": "Police forces tasked with implementing strict state interpretations of Islamic morality exist in several other states, including Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Malaysia. Many - especially those with an affinity with Western lifestyles - chafe against such restrictions on daily life, but others support the idea, and growing religious conservatism has led to pressure for similar forces to be created in countries that do not have them. Here are some places where \"morality police\" forces patrol: Name: Gasht-e Ershad (Persian for Guidance Patrols), supported by Basij militia Who they are: Iran has had various forms of \"morality police\" since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but the Gasht-e Ershad are currently the main agency tasked enforcing Iran's Islamic code of conduct in public. Their focus is on ensuring observance of hijab - mandatory rules requiring women to cover their hair and bodies and discouraging cosmetics. They are empowered to admonish suspects, impose fines or arrest members of the public, but under reforms that come into force this year, will soon no longer be able to do any of these things. Instead, 7,000 undercover Gasht-e Ershad agents will be deployed to report suspected transgressions to the police, who will decide whether to take action. The Gasht-e Ershad is thought to draw a lot of its personnel from the Basij, a hard-line paramilitary unit; it also includes many women. What people think: They are mainly seen as a scourge for urban women - usually from wealthier social groups - who try to push the boundaries of the dress code. This includes wearing the headscarf as far back on the head as possible, or by wearing looser clothing, especially in the heat of summer, although men sporting \"Western\" hairstyles are also at risk. Fear of encountering them has even prompted the creation of Android app that helps people avoid Gasht-e Ershad mobile checkpoints. President Hassan Rouhani has expressed opposition to the Gasht-e Ershad, but Iran's constitution gives him little sway over the security forces. Name: Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, or Mutawa (Arabic for Particularly obedient to God) Who they are: Formed in 1940, the Mutawa is tasked with enforcing Islamic religious law - Sharia - in public places. This includes rules forbidding unrelated males and females to socialise in public, as well as a dress code that encourages women to wear a veil covering all but their eyes. Instead of a police-style uniform, they wear a traditional Saudi robe and keffiyeh. What people think: Although the Mutawa is widely disliked among liberals and the youth, general opinion in the conservative Sunni-majority kingdom supports it. But even conservatives have been irritated by recent high-profile cases deemed excessive or internationally embarrassing, such as an actor being charged for letting fans take selfies with him, or a female mannequin being seized because of its clothing. Perhaps in response to this criticism, the authorities have curbed the force's powers, as a result of which it can no longer arrest or pursue people but can only report them to the regular police. Name: Public Order Police Who they are: The Public Order Police was set up in 1993 to enforce Sharia enshrined in law for Muslims in the then-northern Sudan by President Omar al-Bashir. They have the power to arrest, and suspects are tried - often at speed - in special Public Order Courts; punishments can include flogging or prison. What people think: Many Sudanese resent their activity as an oppressive and often arbitrary interference in private lives, although some - mostly Salafists and other religious conservatives - support their activities. The force is known for shutting down private mixed-sex events, upbraiding women for immodest dress and raiding businesses seen as being in breach of Sharia. It drew international condemnation when female journalist Lubna al-Hussein was arrested and jailed after being caught wearing loose-fitting slacks in public in 2008. Name: Various, usually collectively known as \"religious officers\" Who they are: These are bodies run by Malaysia's federal states - or the federal government for federal territories - to enforce Sharia, which applies to the two thirds of the population who are Muslim. They have the power of arrest, and possible offences range from day-time eating during Ramadan to women and men being \"in close proximity.\" Cases are tried by Sharia courts separate from the ordinary court system. What people think: Religious officers have often been accused of overstepping their remit - a situation often muddied by ambiguity about which takes precedence in certain cases - normal legislation or Sharia. In April, religious officers arrested several people during a raid on a transgender group's fundraising event, accusing participants of hosting a beauty pageant, which Muslims were banned from attending by a 1996 fatwa, or Islamic religious decree.

Here are some places where `` morality police '' forces patrol : Name : Gasht-e Ershad ( Persian for Guidance Patrols ) , supported by Basij militia Who they are : Iran has had various forms of `` morality police '' since the 1979 Islamic Revolution , but the Gasht-e Ershad are currently the main way tasked enforcing Iran 's Islamic code of conduct in public.

They are empowered to admonish suspects , impose fines or arrest members of the public , but under reforms that come into force this year , will presently no longer be able to do any of these things. Instead , 7,000 undercover Gasht-e Ershad agents will be deployed to report suspected transgressions to the law , who will decide whether to take action. The Gasht-e Ershad is thought to draw a lot of its personnel from the Basij , a hard-line paramilitary unit ; it besides includes many women. What people think : They are mainly find out as a scourge for urban women - usually from wealthier social groups - who try to push the boundaries of the dress code. This includes wearing the headscarf as far back on the head as possible , or by wearing looser wear , especially in the heat of summer , although men sporting `` Western '' hairstyles are also at risk. Fear of encountering them has even prompted the creation of Android app that helps mass avoid Gasht-e Ershad mobile checkpoints.

When Kohli fell as part of Sohail Khan's 5-55, Pakistan looked to have dragged themselves back into the game by restricting India to a reachable 300-7. But a chase that never gained momentum was wrecked by a collapse of three wickets for one run and they eventually stumbled to 224 all out, Mohammed Shami claiming 4-35. In isolation, India's win earns national pride in what was billed as the most watched cricket match of all time, with an estimated television audience of one billion, and extends their World Cup record against Pakistan to six wins from as many matches. It was also an emphatic way to begin the defence of a trophy they won on home soil in 2011 and represents their first competitive win since arriving for a tour of Australia in November. Pakistan, winners when the tournament was last held in Australia and New Zealand 23 years ago, can take heart from the way they stuck to the task with the ball, but their limp chase was poor. After all the hype, the action was intriguing, rather than exciting. Making first use of an excellent pitch on a baking hot day, India's innings was underpinned by Kohli's calm accumulation all around the wicket, his 126-ball stay containing only eight fours. The right-hander made Pakistan pay for dropping him twice, the first a tough chance in the deep to Yasir Shah when on only three, the second a more straightforward edge behind to Umar Akmal from the spin of Haris Sohail on 76. When the 26-year-old punched Shahid Afridi to long-on for a 22nd ODI hundred - only Sachin Tendulkar has more for India - he became the first man to score a century in his opening match of a World Cup tournament on two occasions. Support came from Dhawan, who curbed his attacking instincts, and Raina, who repeatedly heaved through the leg side in his 56-ball knock. However, after Kohli edged Sohail to Umar, Pakistan fought back through fast bowler Sohail, who demonstrated consistency of length and canny changes of pace. India scored just 27 runs in their final five overs as five wickets fell, four of them to Sohail. A chase of 301 looked within Pakistan's grasp at the interval, but they never threatened to keep up with the six-an-over run-rate. Younus Khan, promoted to open, gloved a Shami bouncer behind early on and, though Ahmed Shahzad and Haris shared 68, Ravichandran Ashwin found turn with a beautiful off-break to have the latter caught at slip. And, when Umesh Yadav removed Shahzad and Saqaib Mahsood in the space of three balls followed by Umar controversially being given out, caught behind off Ravi Jadeja on review, the contest was effectively over. Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq did his best to delay the inevitable with some clean striking in his 76, but he was the ninth wicket to fall, to the lively Shami, before Mohit Sharma had Sohail caught at long-on to seal India's victory.

But the formation of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State represents a rare glimmer of hope. For the first time, the Burmese government is seeking international expertise to try and solve one of the country's most complex problems. It's a significant shift. For years, the official Burmese mantra has been that \"no foreigner can possibly understand Rakhine's problems.\" Now Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, has been tasked with taking a fresh look at the issues as head of nine-member commission. His report could just add to the mountain of papers written about Rakhine and the Rohingya, or it just might be a game-changer. Will anyone help the Rohingya? Rohingya migrant crisis in 90 seconds The'abandoned' people in Myanmar's election Aung San Suu Kyi where are you? So what's Aung San Suu Kyi up to? Well, first a cynical take. Next week the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is due in the Burmese capital Nay Pyi Taw and in September Ms Suu Kyi will head to the United States for the UN General Assembly and talks with President Obama. The Nobel laureate was no doubt bracing herself for awkward questions about why she wasn't doing more to help Myanmar's Muslim minority and in particular the 800,000 or so Rohingya. Those questions can now be easily deflected with reference to this new commission. But there's more at play than that. By setting up the commission, Ms Suu Kyi is signalling that she is open to new ideas, and doesn't have all the answers. Kofi Annan may be 78 but, as you'd expect from a former UN secretary general, he's his own man. The final report, due to be delivered by the end of August 2017, is likely to contain suggestions that many Burmese consider unpalatable. Almost certainly it will insist that the Rohingya's basic human rights are respected, perhaps recommending that Myanmar offer them a better route to citizenship. In Myanmar's current political climate it's hard for Ms Suu Kyi to bring those ideas to the table. She'd be attacked not just by hardline Buddhists but many within her own party. So Kofi Annan and his report could be the \"Trojan Horse\" that brings this sort of proposal into the national debate. There are of course plenty of caveats. Problems as deeply entrenched as those between the Buddhist and Muslim communities in Rakhine State will not be solved overnight. The animosity between them has built up over decades with many in the Buddhist majority seeing the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from across the border in Bangladesh. After the violence of 2012, more than 100,000 Rohingya were forced from their homes into camps. In the years that have followed there's been no real effort to help them return. Rakhine has become increasingly segregated, with some comparing it to South Africa's apartheid. Things have become quieter but there's been little reconciliation. Whatever the commission ends up concluding, any move to give the Rohingya greater rights will be hugely controversial not just in Rakhine State but across the country. Vocal parts of the Buddhist community are openly hostile towards international aid agencies and the UN. They're unlikely to welcome Kofi Annan's team, no doubt anticipating the sort of recommendations he might make. Implementing any \"solution\" will be even harder.

He says that, although as a youngster he did play on crutches with his pals, when he went to secondary school he lost confidence and began wearing his prosthetic leg all the time. His introduction to amputee football was in England, regularly travelling to Everton to get a game. It is rough at times - he broke his collarbone last year, but did not let that put him off. He describes the sport now being in Scotland as \"brilliant.\" \"That's what I want to give to youngsters,\" he says. \"Don't let anyone stop you, just go for it.\" He adds that if he is still playing at the age of 47, then \"it doesn't matter what age you are.\" Amputee football is played all over the world.

{"original_text": "Media playback is not supported on this device With darkness falling, and your parents calling you in for tea, you squeeze in one last penalty to win the FA Cup, one last drop-kick to win the Rugby World Cup, one last putt to win The Masters. Two Yorkshiremen had those same moments growing up around Sheffield in the early part of the century. This time last year, they made one a reality. Danny Willett may have hit the drives and holed the putts that made him the first Englishman since Nick Faldo in 1996 to win the Masters and don the famous Green Jacket, but his caddie Jonathan Smart is claiming a bit of the credit. In a documentary - When Danny Won The Masters, to be shown on BBC Two at 15:00 BST on Sunday, 2 April - the friends share their memories of an unforgettable Sunday afternoon playing the back nine at Augusta National. Willett, playing with fellow Englishman and friend Lee Westwood, began the final round three shots adrift of defending champion Jordan Spieth, who was four groups behind him on the course. The 29-year-old, who was only playing in the tournament because his son Zachariah was born a week early, takes up the tale on the 10th tee... Danny: We were two under through the first nine but we were still three shots behind Jordan. Jonny: We made an unbelievable par save on the ninth; it was the smelliest nine-footer down the hill and it kept us going. Then we had our funniest moment of the week walking down the 10th fairway. Danny said: \"We're in contention on Sunday at the Masters.\" We were like little kids. We were laughing, not in disbelief, but at realising the situation we were in. Danny: I hit two lovely shots on 10 and made par. Danny: Everyone knows how difficult 11, 12 and 13 are with the wind swirling between the trees. I hit two lovely shots on 11 and made par, found the front edge on the par-three 12th and made par. We stepped on to the 13th tee and Jordan had birdied the eighth and ninth and stretched out to a five-shot lead. The tee shot on the par-five 13th is really difficult for me because I hit a fade and it needs a draw. We hit three wood all week and almost played it as a three-shotter, but on Sunday Jonny and I said,'If we're going to do anything we need to try and force it a little bit'. So I stepped up and gunned it. A little five-yard draw with the driver round the corner. Jonny: Dan is adamant that was his best shot of the week. Danny: I then hit five iron to the middle of the green and had a two-putt birdie but while I was doing that, Jordan had bogeyed 10. Danny: I hit a nice drive down the right on 14 and a wedge to four feet and made birdie again. Jordan bogeyed 11. Jonny: It was a four-footer that was straight downhill but I wasn't sure if it was going to break, it wasn't obvious. Nothing is said, we both know we've got to keep pushing. Those two holes were massive for us. Willett improves to -4, Spieth drops to -5 Danny: The next time we see the leaderboard, Lee Westwood has just chipped in for eagle from the back of the 15th green to get within one of us. Jonny: Everything went ballistic. We had another birdie chance but that shot from Westy brought another player into it. I had goosebumps because the fans on the 16th can also see everything and the sound was ridiculous. Danny: I had a 10-12-footer from the back edge. I thought that was to tie the lead. I missed it but tapped in for par. John put the flag in, walked back, said'that was a good effort' and then we heard all the oohs and aahs from the gallery. Media playback is not supported on this device Jonny: I'll never forget walking to the 16th tee. I saw people in the gallery putting their head in their hands and we turned around and saw they were changing the big scoreboard. Danny: It's just off the back right of 15 and Jordan had gone from five under to one under on the par-three 12th and we were at four under. So we looked at each other and waited for them to change the score because we thought they've got it wrong. After five or 10 steps, we realised we were at four, Westwood at three and Jordan at one. Jonny: That's when things got a little bit more interesting. Danny: I'd been dying for the bathroom so I ran down past the 16th tee and everyone's saying'look at the leaderboard, you're leading the Masters'. I'm in the bathroom and my hands are shaking and I'm nervous but thinking'this is what you practise for'. I kept telling myself, five good swings, see if you can hole a couple of putts and we'll see what happens. When I came out, I was in the best frame of mind I'd been in for a long time. Mentally I was seeing everything as it happened and I wasn't getting too far ahead. Jonny: There was no discussion. If we acknowledge the position we're in, we're admitting we're nervous, so how is that going to help? We stick to our routine. We had 181 yards to the flag. An eight iron. We created a picture, just like we do on every shot. Media playback is not supported on this device Danny: I hit a lovely eight iron to about 10 feet. Jonny: I walked off ahead as soon as he hit it. I'm pretty excitable and I didn't want him to see any emotion I'm giving off. Walking to the green there was no discussion. Everyone's telling Danny'this is yours' but he probably didn't hear any of it. He was ridiculously focused. Danny: We rolled in our birdie putt. Jonny: The putt on 16 was all him. When he has a good line, why would he call me in? It only creates doubt. Danny: Westy hit it to 35 feet and three-whacked, so all of a sudden we've opened a bit more of a gap. In the past 45 minutes, we'd gone from five behind to two in front. It was bonkers. Jonny: On the 17th tee, I consciously said to Dan that these guys behind us are good and capable of making four birdies in a row. Danny: I hit not a bad tee shot but was a bit hindered by a tree for the second and I hit eight iron long left. Looking back, I left myself a really tricky chip. Jonny: I was thinking'there's loads of green to work with' and it was a bog-standard chip shot. It got to the top of the hill and I thought'he's not hit that hard enough' but it rolled over and then I thought'that's quick' but it finished stiff and I thought that wasn't an easy chip shot! Danny: I chipped it pretty much stone dead, which, round Augusta, you don't do. I'm going to go back this year and put a ball down and just see how difficult it is. Danny: We'd hit a little cut driver off the 18th tee all week but we were pretty pumped with adrenaline and Jonny called three wood. Jonny: My book said 296 yards to reach the bunker, so it's not hard to hit a good drive straight into it. He's got a low ball flight so he couldn't have done what Sandy Lyle did out of that bunker and reach the green. Danny: He said:'You can hit three wood as good as you like and you're never ever going to reach those bunkers.' Jonny: Everyone was hustling to get a place to stand. Danny: There was a lot of commotion. I stepped off the tee twice because people are moving up the sides, through the leaves, through the trees. Jonny: That tee shot to me looks like hitting down a hotel corridor and I'm thinking it's getting narrower. Third time he's pulled the trigger. Danny: I hit it 295 yards, straight down the middle of the fairway. Again, the hands were shaking, everything was shaking, but the walk up to the second shot was pretty enjoyable. Jonny: There's a dip down before you walk up the hill to the green. As we got to the bottom, he took a massive deep breath. I knew he was nervous so I just said to him:'You don't need to take that deep a breath, it's not that big a hill.' Danny: I'd done 80 of the job I told myself I had to do - to make five good swings. One more to go. I think we had 183 yards, Jonny will still know. Can't miss the green left, can't miss it short, can't miss it long. I've seen it millions of times on the television, where it's impossible to get up and down from, and where you can give yourself a bit more margin. I pushed the seven iron a bit but it pitched on the collar of the green and worked off the bank back down exactly as I'd seen it before. Jonny: The walk up to the green was an unbelievable experience. We were having a little giggle to ourselves, saying'this is pretty cool'. I wish I'd taken it in more. Danny: It was almost job done. We've got a 13-footer to get to six under, which I thought would be a difficult number for anyone to get to. But we get up on the green and look at the putt and you think it would be nice to get to six but I don't want to drop to four. So I cosied it down there and tapped in for par. Jonny: The walk from the green to the clubhouse was bonkers. It was bizarre, surreal. It's stuff you watch on television and don't do yourself. We're walking off 18 and half-thinking we've won the Masters. Danny: My father-in-law was at the back of the green, giving me a hug. You walk up to the cabin, sign your card [a bogey-free five-under-par 67], making sure you've got all that right and then it's a waiting game. We had 45, 50 minutes of waiting. Jonny: I didn't know what to do with myself. I was half-watching, half-wondering if we should go the practice range in case there's a play-off. Danny: We sat outside the recorders' hut and I'm trying to call [wife] Nic. The signal's not great, I'm just trying to get through to her. And I'm texting my mum and dad and brothers. But I'm constantly looking at the television to see what Jordan does. Spieth birdies the par-five 15th to go three under with three to play. Danny: You're going over all the scenarios where you can get beat. And then he made bogey on 17. He dropped back to two under and it's a physical impossibility to tie. Jonny: I didn't realise the cameras were there and I just jumped on him. Danny: I was on the phone to Nic, and Jonny jumped on me on the sofa. Everyone's seen that on the TV. That was the moment you realise that's what you've worked for and what you've just achieved. It isn't a dream. It's come true. Danny: Every major trophy is significant in its own way but the Green Jacket is special. It's having your locker in the champions' locker room. It's your jacket being in there for the rest of your life. It's being able to go back to Augusta forever, until you don't want to play any more. The ceremony in Butler Cabin. You don't get to go inside the places I got to see at Augusta unless you win at Augusta. I'm honoured to be part of that now. Jonny: We were whisked round the back of the clubhouse to Butler Cabin. That was cool. You've watched it on TV and then we're doing it. Dan's putting a Green Jacket on. I remember them fitting it because they've got them all lined up. Before he went in the room he looked across at me, just laughing. It was nuts. We've all had putts as juniors to win the Masters. I always dreamt about doing it but it was mega to be as close as I was to it and have some sort of contribution to Dan winning it. Danny: When you walk through the door at home, you're not Masters champion any more. You're dad, or Dan. You're straight back to changing nappies and you take the jacket off so you don't get anything on it. The only time I've watched it back was that evening. I opened a beer and sat on the sofa with Nic. Watched it for an hour and a half. Highlights of what we'd done two days before. Just a crazy old few days really.", "text_perturb": "Media playback is not supported on this device With darkness falling , and your parents calling you in for tea , you squeeze in one last penalty to make headway the FA Cup , one last drop-kick to make headway the Rugby World Cup , one last putt to make headway The Masters.

We 've got a 13-footer to get to six under , which I thought would be a difficult figure for anyone to get to. But we get up on the green and look at the putt and you think it would be nice to get to six but I do n't desire to drop to four. thusly I cosied it down there and tapped in for par. Jonny : The walking from the green to the clubhouse was bonkers. It was freaky , surreal. It 's stuff you watch on television and come n't come yourself. We 're walking off 18 and half-thinking we 've bring home the bacon the Masters. Danny : My father-in-law was at the back of the green , commit me a hug. You walk up to the cabin , sign your card [ a bogey-free five-under-par 67 ] , making sure you 've become all that right and then it 's a waiting game. We had 45 , 50 minutes of hold off. Jonny : I did n't know what to cause with myself. I was half-watching , half-wondering if we should decease the practice range in case there 's a play-off. Danny : We sat outside the recorders ' hut and I 'm trying to ring [ wife ] Nic. The sign 's not great , I 'm just trying to get through to her. And I 'm texting my mum and dada and brothers. But I 'm constantly looking at the television to see what Jordan suffice. Spieth birdie the par-five 15th to go three under with three to play. Danny : You 're going over all the scenarios where you can perplex beat. And then he take a shit bogey on 17. He unload back to two under and it 's a physical impossibility to tie. Jonny : I did n't realise the cameras were there and I just startle on him. Danny : I was on the earphone to Nic , and Jonny jumped on me on the sofa. Everyone 's seen that on the telecasting. That make up the moment you realise that 's what you 've worked for and what you 've just achieved. It is n't a dreaming. It 's come true. Danny : Every major trophy is significant in its own way of life but the Green Jacket is special. It 's give birth your locker in the champions ' locker room. It 's your jacket being in there for the rest of your liveliness. It 's being able to go back to Augusta forever , until you do n't want to play any more than. The ceremonial occasion in Butler Cabin. You do n't get to go inside the places I got to see at capital of maine unless you win at capital of maine. I 'm honoured to be constituent of that now. Jonny : We exist whisked round the back of the clubhouse to Butler Cabin. That was coolheaded. You 've watched it on TV and so we 're doing it. Dan 's putting a Green crown on. I remember them accommodate it because they 've got them all lined up. Before he decease in the room he looked across at me , just laughing. It be nuts. We 've all had putt as juniors to win the Masters. I always dreamt about doing it but it was mega to be as close as I was to it and have some form of contribution to Dan winning it. Danny : When you walk through the door at home , you 're not Masters defend any more. You 're dad , or Dan. You 're straight back to change nappies and you take the jacket off so you do n't get anything on it. The only time I 've watched it backward was that evening. I spread a beer and sat on the sofa with Nic. Watched it for an hour and a one half. highlighting of what we 'd done two days before. Just a crazy old few days very. ", "label": 1}
{"original_text": "In an election pledge, Labour said giving working parents 30 hours free childcare a week for 48 weeks of the year would cost an extra PS84m annually. Economist Gillian Paull told BBC Wales the \"upper limit\" could reach PS200m if \"nearly all\" parents took up the offer. The Welsh Government said it was currently analysing the likely costs. The promise to provide 30 hours free childcare a week was one of Labour's key election pledges and is now part of its five-year programme for government. The childcare will be made available to working parents of three- and four-year-olds for 48 weeks of the year.

{"original_text": "The evacuation of the Jet2 plane at East Midlands Airport was hampered when one of the escape chutes did not work. It came after the pilot was unable to check whether landing gear had deployed and the failure of the cabin PA system. The initial fault was caused by a loose connection the Air Accident Investigation Branch concluded. Because of the landing gear problems, the pilot - flying from Ibiza last September - was forced to fly over the airport at 1,000 ft (300m) so ground crew could check if it had come down, the report said. But it was too dark to tell and the co-pilot had to look out of windows in the main cabin, before the pilot was cleared to land. As the plane taxied on the runway, passengers reportedly panicked when the smoke began to seep into the cabin. Because the PA system was not working, cabin crew tried to use a loud hailer to tell passengers but the volume button had fallen off. The escape chute then failed to deploy effectively, forcing some of the passengers to run out on to the wing before leaping onto the ground. One member of cabin crew only realised the plane was being evacuated when she saw passengers on the wing. According to the report, a problem was first spotted when the pilots realised the address system was not working. Several other failures were noticed including an equipment cooling fan, a radio, weather radar, the autobrake, power to the standby altitude indicator and compass. It was realised there was a problem with a battery connection, known as a busbar, forcing the pilots to request a quick landing at the airport. After a successful landing, passengers and crew could smell smoke but the commander could not announce a full evacuation. Since the incident, Jet2 has included a procedure within its manual which will better-prepare pilots in the event of a repeat and also reduce the chance it will result in an evacuation, the report said. The AAIB concluded all the problems - bar the escape chute - stemmed from the loose connection possibly caused by the over-tightened nut. It also noted smoke started to seep into the cabin because a fan stopped working creating a build up of dust and oil in the air conditioning.

{"original_text": "From April 2016, those in England and Wales will have to pay a 3 surcharge on each stamp duty band. George Osborne said the new surcharge would raise PS1bn extra for the Treasury by 2021. Landlords reacted angrily to the change, saying it would \"choke off\" investment in rented properties. Other changes announced by the chancellor included an extended Help to Buy scheme in London, and more money for the Starter Homes programme. The stamp duty surcharge will lift each band by 3. That means that for properties worth between PS125,000 and PS250,000, where the stamp duty is 2, buy-to-let landlords will pay 5. For the average buy-to-let purchase of PS184,000, that means they will pay an extra PS5,520 from April 2016. Commercial property investors, with more than 15 properties, are expected to be exempt from the new charges. Buy-to-let landlords will also be hit by a change to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) rules. From April 2019, they will have to pay any CGT due within 30 days of selling a property, rather than waiting till the end of the tax year, as at present. Landlords are already due to get a lower rate of tax relief on mortgage payments. In his summer Budget, the chancellor said that landlords would only receive the basic rate of tax relief - 20 - on mortgage payments, a change being phased in from 2017. Responding to the latest changes, Richard Lambert, chief executive of the National Landlords Association said: \"The chancellor's political intention is crystal clear; he wants to choke off future investment in private properties to rent. \"If it's the chancellor's intention to completely eradicate buy-to-let in the UK then it's a mystery to us why he doesn't just come out and say so.\" Up to PS60m of the money raised from the stamp duty surcharge will go to help home-buyers in England in places where holiday homes have forced up local prices. The Help to Buy (equity loan) scheme in England will also be extended to 2021, one year longer than planned. An extension to the scheme in London will see buyers who can find a 5 deposit given a loan worth up to 40 of the property. The loan will be interest free for five years. Elsewhere the existing maximum loan is for 20 of the property's value. In total, the government will put an extra PS6.9bn into housing. This includes an extra PS2.3bn in loans for the government's starter homes programme, and PS4bn lent to housing associations and local authorities to build more homes for shared ownership.

The firm said it also planned to cover the reactor building. Nearly 14,000 people died and another 14,000 are still unaccounted for after the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March. Tepco unveiled its roadmap as Hillary Clinton briefly visited Tokyo to pledge America's \"steadfast support\" for Japan's reconstruction. Radiation levels in the sea near reactor 2 rose to 6,500 times the legal limit on Friday, up from 1,100 times a day earlier, Tepco has said, raising fears of fresh radiation leaks. Tsunehisa Katsumata, the chairman of Tepco, Asia's largest utility, told a news conference in Tokyo on Sunday they would need up to nine months to bring the power plant to\"cold shutdown.\" He said the plan would allow the tens of thousands of families evacuated from the area around the facility to return home as soon as possible. \"We sincerely apologise for causing troubles,\" Mr Katsumata said. \"We are doing our utmost to prevent the crisis from further worsening.\" Tepco said after cold shutdown it would focus on encasing the reactor buildings, cleaning up contaminated soil and removing nuclear fuel. Japan's government had ordered Tepco to come up with a timetable to end the crisis, now rated on a par with the world's worst nuclear accident, the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. But the BBC's Roland Buerk in Tokyo says it is still not certain that the nine-month deadline can be achieved. He says the immediate priority for Tepco is to stop radioactive water leaking into the Pacific Ocean. The utility said it was sending remote-controlled robots into one of the reactors on Sunday to gauge radiation and temperature levels. UK defence contractor QinetiQ said it had provided the machines, which are directed by controllers usually supplied with games consoles. The robots can carry out tasks such as rubble clearance, demolition and radiation testing. Japan is a world leader in such technology, but its robots are not adapted for dirty work such as meltdowns at nuclear plants, experts say. Emergency workers have been unable to enter any reactor building since the disaster. Our correspondent says Japan's recovery bill has been estimated at 300bn (PS184bn) - already the most expensive disaster in history. But the government said last week that figure might be an underestimate.

America has won Japanese admiration for sending scores of US ships and aircraft as well as 20,000 troops to help the relief effort. Operation Tomodachi, or Friend, was the biggest humanitarian mission the US has conducted in Japan.

Japan is a world leader in such technology , but its robots are not adapted for dirty work such as meltdowns at atomic plants , experts say. Emergency workers have been ineffective to enter any reactor building since the disaster. Our correspondent says Japan 's recovery bill has been estimated at 300bn ( PS184bn ) - already the well nigh expensive disaster in history. But the regime said last week that figure might be an underestimate. Meanwhile , US Secretary of State Clinton said in Japan she believed the country would emerge stronger from its worst crisis since macrocosm War II. She met Prime Minister Naoto Kan and had tea with Emperor Akihito at the Imperial Palace , state to be a rare privilege for a non-head of state on a Sunday. America has won Japanese admiration for sending scores of US ships and aircraft equally well as 20,000 troops to help the relief effort. Operation Tomodachi , or Friend , was the biggest humanitarian mission the US deliver conducted in Japan. Before the seism , the two nations ' ties had been strained by a dispute over US military bases on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa. Mr Kan 's predecessor as prime minister quit last year after being accused of reneging on a promise to remove at least one of the bases. ", "label": 1}
{"original_text": "Energy will travel via the world's longest sub-sea electricity interconnector. The a'!2bn (PS1.4bn) project has been rubber stamped between National Grid and its Norwegian equivalent Statnett. The UK aims to import enough hydro-power from Norway to provide 14 of yearly household electricity needs. Alan Foster, director of European business development for National Grid, said: \"Access to low-carbon energy from Norway hydro-power stations will help us meet the challenge of greener, affordable energy. \"It also adds to the diversity of energy sources for UK and potentially can reduce peak prices, with benefits for consumers and businesses.\" Statnett chief executive Auke Lont said: \"Not only is this a technically impressive project where we will set a new world record, it is also an important contribution to the increase of renewable energy production on both sides.\" The North Sea Network (NSN) interconnector is due to be completed in 2021 and will have a capacity of 1.4 gigawatts (GW). The sub-sea electricity cable will connect the two countries' electricity markets directly for the first time. Energy secretary Ed Davey said: \"Britain will benefit from Norwegian green hydropower, at the flick of a switch, providing green back-up power when the wind's not blowing, and this will actually save people money.\" The new NSN interconnector will be more than 730km long and will carry enough power for 750,000 homes at peak demand, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said. For average usage by households, it could power up to four million homes, she added. Most electricity in Norway is generated from hydropower, and water from Norwegian lakes will generate the electricity that will be connected into the UK network. The NSN cable will connect to the Norwegian network at Kvilldal, next to the Kvilldal power station, which at 1,240 megawatts (MW) is the largest power station in Norway in terms of capacity. The Kvilldal plant is powered by the waters in the Blasjo reservoir, the country's biggest artificial lake. The sub-sea cable will connect to the UK network at Blyth in Northumberland. Crucially, the UK will be able to call on the power at short notice. The energy will be used to manage the growing levels of intermittent wind power on the network. It will also be a two-way link. Norway will be able to import power from the UK during dry periods when hydroelectric power is less widely available. According to the government, the link will help the UK benefit from Norway's cheaper electricity prices. It estimates that the interconnector will deliver consumer benefits of up to PS3.5bn through to 2040. By reducing the need for new gas-fired power plants, the government insists the link will also reduce the UK's green house gas emissions. Interconnectors are transmission cables that allow electricity to flow from one country to another. Energy regulator Ofgem says that they can lower consumer bills by accessing cheaper power and boosting UK energy supplies. The UK mainland currently has four interconnectors that link to France, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Together they provide around 4 GW of electricity capacity. This represents about 4 of Britain's electricity supply. The energy regulator is currently examining the need for two further interconnectors to France and one to Denmark.

{"original_text": "To be 80-5 and give away a 200-run lead is a problem in any Test, let alone one where you know the pitch is going to get more difficult to bat on later in the match. However, for as tricky as the surface became - and some deliveries did do a lot - there were too many dismissals in England's second innings in particular that were not down to the pitch. The tourists were shown the way initially by Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow in the first innings, then by opening pair Alastair Cook and Haseeb Hameed in the second. Yet, English collapses - Michael Vaughan has referred to a \"little disease\" when panic appears to set in - were common. Four wickets for 29 runs and then four wickets for 30 runs in the first innings, eight wickets for 68 runs on the final day. It ultimately comes down to a batsman's state of mind. When you get a difficult delivery or the ball misbehaves, it can be very hard to put that out of your thoughts, but that is what the very best are able to do. The ability to clear your mind and focus on the next delivery is a skill my Test Match Special colleague Geoffrey Boycott speaks of so often. Media playback is not supported on this device So it seems that the next three Tests in this series will be about England's mindset. Can they play every ball on its merits? Can they keep their chins up if they lose the toss? Can they be positive without being reckless? Can they remember that they have played some good cricket? Do they believe that they can beat India? The answers to those questions are not straightforward because India is such a difficult place to tour. We knew from the start that playing five matches here straight after two in Bangladesh was going to be difficult in terms of managing morale and keeping spirits high. England do not have to look too far into the past for inspiration. They came from behind to win here four years ago. Going further into the past, the 1984-85 tour led by David Gower that I was part of was a real success because the togetherness of the team helped us overcame everything that was thrown at us. Indira Gandhi, the prime minister, was assassinated hours after the touring party arrived. The UK's deputy high commissioner Percy Norris later suffered the same fate, a day after hosting a reception for the England team. England stayed out there despite fears the tour would be cancelled, then lost the first Test because of some questionable umpiring. Yet, England came back to win that series 2-1 and that is the mindset that the class of 2016 have to adopt. If they can, India can be beaten because we have already seen that these are two evenly matched sides. The hosts' only advantage is they have greater experience playing in these conditions. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, the world's leading Test wicket-taker this year, does not look too frightening when conditions are not in his favour. The same can be said for his partner in crime Ravindra Jadeja. These are bowlers that can be handled. India also have plenty of batsmen yet to register runs. Openers KL Rahul and Murali Vijay both need a score, as do Ajinkya Rahane and wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha. Yes, Cheteshwar Pujara is in good form and captain Virat Kohli was in stellar touch in Visakhapatnam - he scored 248 runs and the winning margin was 246, so imagine the boon it would be for England if they can remove him cheaply. Not that the tourists do not have personnel issues of their own. Ben Duckett, who has made only 18 runs in three innings, looks very unlikely to play in the third Test in Mohali. England got into a muddle by not opening the batting with Hameed in Bangladesh and now both Gary Ballance and Duckett have failed at number four. The next available option appears to be Jos Buttler, one of the most exciting limited-overs players in the world. Is he the answer in the top order of a Test line-up against the spinning ball? We just do not know. Add to that the fact Buttler has played only one first-class match in the past year and there will be a lot of pressure on him if he is chosen to play in the next Test. Anyone saying with certainty that Buttler is the cavalry to solve England's problems is making a very big statement. Spinner Zafar Ansari is another who looks set to miss out on playing in the third Test. He may well have been left out anyway in order for England to play a fourth pace bowler, but he had a poor time with both ball and bat in Visakhapatnam. Those two aside, the other players that England have used in this series will all feel good. Cook, Hameed, Joe Root, Moeen Ali, Stokes and Bairstow have all made runs. Adil Rashid is really looking the part as a Test spin bowler, James Anderson has made an excellent return from injury and Chris Woakes will be raring to go after being rested for the second Test. The only question England will have is over the fitness of Stuart Broad, who returned his best bowling figures in India with a strained tendon in his foot. India can be beaten and England certainly have the ability. Do they have the mentality? Jonathan Agnew was speaking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt.", "text_perturb": "To be 80-5 and give away a 200-run lead is a problem in any mental test , let alone one where you know the pitch is going to get more difficult to bat on later in the match. However , for as tricky as the surface became - and some deliveries did do a lot - there were too many dismissals in England 's second innings in particular that were non down to the pitch. The tourists were shown the way initially by Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow in the first innings , then by opening pair Alastair Cook and Haseeb Hameed in the d. Yet , English collapses - Michael Vaughan has referred to a `` little disease '' when panic appears to congeal in - were common. Four wickets for 29 runs and then four wickets for 30 runs in the first innings , eight wickets for 68 runs on the final daylight. It ultimately descend down to a batsman 's state of mind. When you get a difficult delivery or the ball misbehaves , it can be very hard to put that out of your thoughts , but that is what the very safe are able to do. The ability to clear your mind and focus on the next delivery is a skill my Test Match special colleague Geoffrey Boycott speaks of so often. Media playback is not supported on this device So it seems that the next three Tests in this series will embody about England 's mindset. Can they play every lump on its merits ? Can they keep their chins up if they lose the toss ? Can they be positive without being reckless ? Can they remember that they have played some good cricket ? Do they believe that they can beat India ? The answers to those questions are not straightforward because India is such a difficult place to tour. We knew from the start that playing five matches here straight after two in Bangladesh was going to be difficult in terms of managing team spirit and keeping spirits high. England do not have to seem too far into the past for inspiration. They came from behind to win here four yr ago. Going further into the past , the 1984-85 tour led by David Gower that I was contribution of was a real success because the togetherness of the team helped us overcame everything that was thrown at us. Indira Gandhi , the prime minister , was assassinate hours after the touring party arrived. The UK 's deputy high commissioner Percy Norris later suffered the same fate , a daylight after hosting a reception for the England team. England stayed out there despite fearfulness the tour would be cancelled , then lost the first Test because of some questionable umpiring.

Joe Mason's header gave Cardiff hope, but a slick counter attack saw Woolford restore the two-goal advantage. Cardiff again replied through Heidar Helguson only for debutant Sam Baldock to finally put the result beyond doubt with three minutes remaining. Bristol City's final two goals epitomised the difference between the two sides as they broke with pace and purpose to rip open Cardiff's defence. Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors, who offered virtually nothing in the first half of a match which kicked off before the day's other Championship fixtures, sorely missed Craig Bellamy's penetration as the starting front three of Helguson, debutant Tommy Smith and Don Cowie failed to make any impact. Mason's introduction and a change of formation at half-time transformed Cardiff, giving manager Malky Mackay food for thought as he considers how best to mould a new-look side. But there were plenty of positives for Robins manager Derek McInnes as his side scored four goals for a successive Championship match to secure only a second win over Cardiff in the last 10 league meetings. Bristol City's pressure gradually grew as the first half wore on, with the pacey Albert Adomah exploiting the space vacated by Cardiff's advancing full-backs. Adomah wasted the first clear chance when he shot wide and then Ryan Taylor's header found the side netting. But the opener was a complete gift as Aron Gunnarsson's misplaced pass deep in his own half exposed the Cardiff defence. Adomah penetrated before his cut-back found Pearson, who arced the ball into the bottom-left corner from the just inside the penalty area. The outstanding Jonathan Stead was the next architect as more sloppy Cardiff play led to the home side's second on the stroke of half-time. The rangy striker used his frame to protect the ball and the on-rushing Woolford passed the ball past Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall. Mackay responded to his side's lacklustre show by replacing Gunnarsson with Mason, and the change bore immediate dividends as the substitute found space in a crowded six-yard box to head home after Peter Whittingham's corner. The Bluebirds, back in their more familiar blue shirts, immediately found more purpose and energy, with Mason's direct running finally testing the home defenders. Whittingham, whose long-range efforts were all Cardiff managed in the first half, went close with another shot after Smith had broken through. But the Robins responded to the warning signs with a textbook counter attack to score their third. The Cardiff defence, which included debutant Matthew Connolly in Ben Turner's absence with injury, was ripped apart down the middle and Woolford had a simple task to score after Baldock's shot rebounded off the post. Helguson, scoring his first league goal since joining Cardiff from Queens Park Rangers, ensured a tense final minutes when he slotted through Tom Heaton's legs. But the home nerves were calmed five minutes later when Baldock, a 64th-minute substitute, ensured a scoring debut when he beat Marshall after being played through the heart of the static Cardiff defence. Bristol City manager Derek McInnes: \"We are getting goals from the middle of the park, which we didn't do last season and now have some great options up front. \"With Sam [Baldock] and Steve [Davies] on board, we have a lot of different strikers, who pose threats in various ways.

The first stage in the three-year project follows criticism about the reliability of Loganair services. The airline's business includes operating lifeline routes to and from the Scottish islands, including Lewis in the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland. Last year, members of the public and MSPs raised concerns about the reliability of some of these services.

As well as being given a revamp, each plane is to undergo a specialist check every 36 months. Loganair said this \"intensive process\" would involve stripping back the aircraft to the basic airframe structure for an examination using X-ray machines.

A diagnosis of Alzheimer's cannot be made with absolute certainty until a patient has died and their brain is examined.

One protein, called tau, is very closely linked to the disease, with tangles of tau thought to be one way in which brain cells are killed.

Timeline: Ten years of stop and start for NI's public services college The BBC revealed in March that a programme board in charge of the Desertcreat project had concluded it was no longer economically viable. It said the joint college as originally planned was no longer needed because of reduction in the number of training days required by each of the three services.

All the indications are that the votes on both the so-called new'Super Eight football troll ' and the proposal to bring forward the All-Ireland finals will be exceptionally close , with a two-thirds ' majority required for the format changes to be tried for a three-year period. To make matters still complicated , congress will also hear a number of motions calls from the two-thirds majority to be scrapped , with one call suggestion a simple majority and another calling for the figure to be lowered to 60. Inevitably , those motions will require a two-thirds absolute majority to be passed. Going into the weekend , Croke Park 's desire for replays to be scrapped - in favour of extra-time - in all championship biz bar provincial and All-Ireland finals looks likely to be comfortably passed. At last yr 's congress , motions to move All-Ireland Finals to earlier in the yr and scrap replays were both defeated , although the finals proposal fell narrowly short after getting support from 60. 8 of delegate.

The UN says the expected record turnout for the signing shows overwhelming global support for tackling rising temperatures. But some environmentalists have dismissed the event as a \"distraction.\" Despite the absence of President Obama, around 60 world leaders are expected here at UN headquarters, including French President Francois Hollande and Prime Minister Trudeau from Canada. But their signatures alone will not be enough to make the Paris agreement operational. The legal requirements mean that each country will have to go through a process of ratification. For some this will require nothing more than the assent of the political leader as in the example of the United States. Others though, such as India and Japan, will have to take the document to their parliaments; some may need new laws. The European Union is expected to lag behind on this issue as it has not yet agreed with the 28 member states on how emissions cuts will be shared out. Each member state will also have to ratify the deal individually. Some countries, including the Marshall Islands, Palau, Fiji and Switzerland, have already completed this step and will be able to formally join the agreement on April 22. To become operational, the treaty needs at least 55 countries representing at least 55 of global emissions to complete all the steps. While this is a tough threshold to reach an unusual coalition of interests is making it possible. Firstly President Obama is keen to ensure the deal is operational before his successor takes office next January. If the next President wants to take the US out of an established treaty they will have to wait for four years - by which time they may no longer be in charge. Many of the least developed countries are pushing forward as well because a clerical error in the drafting of the new agreement means it becomes operational as soon at it hits the 5555 mark, and not in 2020 as many people had supposed. Poorer countries fear that if the threshold is reached they could be left out in the cold if they haven't ratified, meaning they would not be able to influence the rules and organisation of the new deal. \"There was a little buzz a few weeks back with someone suggesting that some of the smaller counties should refrain from signing, in order to get a better deal,\" explained Reid Detchon from the United Nations Foundation. \"The fact that there is this large number of developing [countries] that are coming to the table here says that argument hasn't taken root and they really saw how deeply their own national self interest was bound up in success here.\" Scientists and analysts are also keen on a speedy implementation of the agreement for different reasons. According to a new study by researchers at Chatham House, leaving any increase in the level of carbon cutting ambition until 2025 as detailed in the Paris deal would make it nigh on impossible to keep temperatures below 2 degrees C, never mind 1.5. \"For the Paris agreement to have any credibility we can't afford to wait ten years in order to increase ambition,\" said Shane Tomlinson, a senior research fellow at Chatham House. \"Estimates suggest that the gap between where emissions will be and where they need to be, will be around 11 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide in 2025.

{"original_text": "But when the last Labour government tried to bring them in the plan faced robust opposition, and the reintroduction of ID cards is not currently being considered by this government. Everyone, even children, had to carry an ID card during World War Two. Introduced in 1939 the idea was to enable the government to keep track of a transient population, displaced by bombs or evacuated from their homes. The wartime ID card system remained in place after 1945, eventually going out of use in the early 1950s. Labour revived the idea of a national identity card scheme at the start of the new century. David Blunkett, the then Home Secretary, outlined the plans in 2002. At the time the project had an estimated cost of up to PS3bn. He said the cards would ensure people did not work if they were not entitled to and did not \"draw on services which are free in this country, unless they are entitled to.\" In March 2006 and after several defeats in the House of Lords, the Identity Cards Act became law and in November 2008 the roll-out of compulsory ID cards for foreign nationals began. The scheme remained controversial and in 2009 a new Home Secretary, Alan Johnson said the cards would not be compulsory for UK citizens, however pilot schemes continued and at the end of 2009 people in Greater Manchester became the first in the UK to be able to buy a biometric ID card - at a cost of PS30. By the time of the 2010 General Election around 15,000 were thought to be in circulation, but Labour lost the election and the new coalition government scrapped the project. The cards were no longer valid and the national identity register, which held the personal details of everyone issued with an identity card, including photographs and fingerprint biometrics was destroyed in 2011. Various arguments have been put forward for and against the use of ID cards. Those in favour say they provide clarity for employers, are the only way to properly deal with illegal immigration and tackle both identity and benefit fraud. It has also been suggested they could help in the fight against terrorism. Those against ID cards point to the expense of bringing in any scheme, Labour's project is said to have cost PS5bn. Opponents also highlight the civil liberties concerns and what they believe is unnecessary data collection and intrusion by the state. In response to the recent scenes of thousands of migrants trying to get to the UK after crossing from North Africa and travelling through Europe, the deputy mayor of Calais, Philippe Mignonet has said the UK should introduce ID cards (and employment controls). But there's still strong opposition to the idea here. The anti-ID cards pressure group NO2ID remains in existence and is withering about the deputy mayor's suggestion. NO2ID's General Secretary Guy Herbert disagrees with the deputy mayor: \"France has had ID cards for decades, but they have not stopped migrants coming to his town. \"In fact though coalition rhetoric was against the Blair government's centralised scheme, the UK makes lots of demands on people to produce ID in various forms in everyday life. This is getting steadily worse, but does not seem to have made much difference to people with strong motivations to come here.\" And the deputy mayor of Calais is likely to be disappointed by the response from Britain's politicians too. The Shadow Immigration Minister David Hanson was in the Home Office when Labour introduced its scheme. When asked what he thought now about identity cards, he said: \" I felt they were a way in which we can at least track and identify individuals but that debate has moved on.... we're not going to introduce them in the near future given the capital and financial cost of doing that - what we need to do is to ensure that we have proper enforcement.\" The Home Office also rejected the idea, a spokesperson said: \"The government has no plans to introduce ID cards in the UK.\" Read more: Would Calais migrants really be better off in the UK?", "text_perturb": "But when the last Labour political science tried to bring them in the plan faced robust opposition , and the reintroduction of ID cards is not currently being considered by this political science.

The scheme remained controversial and in 2009 a new Home Secretary , Alan Johnson said the cards would not be compulsory for UK citizens , however pilot schemes continued and at the end of 2009 people in Greater Manchester became the first in the UK to be able to buy a biometric ID bill - at a cost of PS30. By the time of the 2010 General Election around 15,000 were thought to be in circulation , but Labour lost the election and the new fusion government scrapped the project. The cards were no longer valid and the national identity register , which held the personal details of everyone issued with an identity card , including photographs and fingerprint biometrics was demolish in 2011. versatile arguments have been put forward for and against the use of ID cards. Those in favour say they provide clarity for employers , are the only way to properly parcel out with illegal immigration and tackle both identity and benefit fraud. It has also been suggested they could help in the battle against terrorism. Those against ID cards point to the disbursal of bringing in any scheme , Labour 's project is said to have cost PS5bn. Opponents also highlight the civil liberties concerns and what they believe is unnecessary data collection and intrusion by the nation. In response to the recent scenes of thousands of migrants trying to get to the UK after crossing from North Africa and travelling through Europe , the deputy mayor of Calais , Philippe Mignonet throw said the UK should introduce ID cards ( and employment controls ). But there 's still strong foe to the idea here. The anti-ID cards pressure mathematical group NO2ID remains in existence and is withering about the deputy mayor 's suggestion. NO2ID 's general Secretary Guy Herbert disagrees with the deputy mayor : `` France has had ID cards for decades , but they have not stopped migrants coming to his town. `` In fact though coalition rhetoric was against the Blair government 's centralised scheme , the UK makes lots of demands on people to produce gem state in various forms in everyday life. This cost getting steadily worse , but does not seem to have made much difference to people with strong motivations to come here. `` And the deputy mayor of Calais is likely to be disappointed by the reception from Britain 's politicians too. The Shadow Immigration Minister David Hanson was in the Home Office when travail introduced its scheme. When asked what he thought now about identicalness cards , he said : `` I felt they were a way in which we can at least track and identify individuals but that debate has moved on. . . . we 're not going to preface them in the near future given the capital and financial cost of doing that - what we need to do is to ensure that we have proper enforcement. `` The Home Office also rejected the melodic theme , a spokesperson said : `` The government has no plans to introduce ID cards in the UK. `` Read more : Would Calais migrant really be better off in the UK ?", "label": 1}

He said the Vader role came from a regular casting call, first with a self-filmed tape, then a recall to Pinewood Studios. \"It's very, very secretive.

The army claimed the men were armed. Eyewitnesses dispute this, consistent with forensic tests on Rooney and his friend that suggested neither youth was armed. Mr Rooney was buried without a post-mortem examination. However, while a medical report recorded a bullet entry wound, there was no mention of an exit wound. The PSNI want to see if the bullet can be retrieved from Mr Rooney's remains, assuming it was lodged in his body. It may then be possible to determine whether the bullet came from a military weapon. The year of 1972 was the most violent of the 30-year Northern Ireland conflict. A total of 497 people died, mostly civilians killed in bombings or shot by the Provisional IRA and 151 soldiers and police officers were also killed. Panorama showed that, between May and September 1972, there were several unprovoked \"drive-by\" attacks on unarmed civilians by MRF soldiers similar to the one that killed Mr Rooney. At the time, locals assumed the gunmen were loyalists. One attack is alleged to have been preceded by a friendly wave from the driver before a machine gun protruding from a rear window cut down three unarmed men chatting at a taxi rank.

Two months after Daniel Rooney was shot, the military top brass decided the MRF was imperilling the army's already damaged reputation. Declassified papers show that a review of the MRF found there was \"no provision for detailed command and control.\" The MRF was wound up after only 14 months.

Despite the loss of Graeme Smith, Jacques Kallis and Morne Morkel, they have stepped up to the mark, with Colin Ingram and David Miller showing against West Indies that they can be dangerous batsman at this level. Dale Steyn's return to fitness has given them added potency with the ball at just the right time, alongside useful contributions from Chris Morris and Ryan McLaren. England have reached the last four after sticking to a method that may have come in for a fair bit of criticism but has proved successful. Much of the scrutiny has focused on the top three batsmen and their perceived reluctance to play high-risk cricket, but I am more concerned by the lack of runs from the middle order to date. Ravi Bopara showed the way with his 13-ball 33 against Sri Lanka, but now is the time for Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler to come to the party. I think the new ball will be the key to deciding the outcome of this match. Can England's top order handle the pace and skill of Steyn? How will South Africa fare against Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad? My heart says England, but my head says South Africa. The all-Asian second semi-final is a repeat of the 2011 World Cup final and if it proves half as good a game as that was, the spectators in Cardiff will be in for a treat. Sri Lanka have shown they are a dangerous team with good wins over England and Australia, but India are a level above any other side in this tournament and I fully expect them to go on and reach the final. From numbers one to 11 they have played outstanding cricket. They are younger and hungrier than Indian sides of the past and their athletic fielding has added another dimension to their play. They have the tournament's outstanding batsman in Shikhar Dhawan and a richly-varied bowling attack that blends the pace of Ishant Sharma and the swing of Bhuvneshwar Kumar with the exceptional spin axis of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. Sri Lanka will be looking to one of their proven match-winners - Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene or Lasith Malinga - to tilt things their way, but unless India have an off day, I can only see one winner.

It was an 18-hour rollercoaster and I must admit there will comprise a few more similar lengthy working days ahead for me. Sport can be a ruthless business and both Chris Adams and Ian Salisbury have been thanked for their efforts over the last four and half years by Surrey as the club now looks to move things forward in a novel direction. My new role is to superintend professional cricket at the club. Due to my other working commitments , I will not be at every day of every match but I will be putting structures in place for the immediate future and beyond while our bowling coach Stuart Barnes will step up and run the side on a day-to-day footing.

{"original_text": "The greatest foreign policy disasters have tended to come when the UK has either ignored America - such as when it joined France in invading Suez - or when it has followed the US too blindly, as in the invasion of Iraq, against the warnings of many in Europe. Britain has done better when it has played its traditional role as a bridge between the two continents: seeking to manage America's swings between isolationism and interventionism while at the same time reassuring Europe that the US could be more than just a brash Nato ally. This Atlanticist analysis is, of course, a simplification of a complex relationship, but the point stands: the UK has a unique opportunity by virtue of its history and geography to bring the US and Europe together, not take sides. And yet the election of Donald Trump risks doing just that, driving a wedge between Britain and the EU just when both sides need it least. Since the president-elect's shock election, the British government has staggered, recovered its balance and started making overtures to the emerging administration. Its public statements have been welcoming and warm. Here is Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's latest description of the president-elect, in a Czech newspaper: \"Donald Trump is dealmaker, he is a guy who believes firmly in values that I believe in too - freedom and democracy. As far as I understand, he is in many aspects a liberal guy from New York.\" This is a long way from the criticisms that he and Prime Minister Theresa May uttered during the campaign. But both are now eating their words without shame, for they believe that it is in the national interest for the government to engage with next president of the United States, whatever his character, temperament and policy agenda. The prime minister's Guildhall speech - arguing that everyone should benefit from globalisation - may have been designed to show British voters that she has an agenda for change. But it also sent a strong signal to Mr Trump that she understood the forces that led to his election and the shared need for the whole world to address them. In contrast, some EU countries have worn their hearts on their sleeve and expressed their dissatisfaction at the election of a man whose opinions they find distasteful. This was the context of the emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers this week, which Boris Johnson dismissed as a \"whinge-o-rama.\" Some British diplomats saw the meeting as an attempt by the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, to grandstand and use Mr Trump's election to drive forward her own agenda for more EU defence cooperation. She was distinctly sarcastic about Mr Johnson's refusal to attend the meeting, saying it was \"normal\" for a country that had decided to leave the EU not to be interested in its relations with the US. As if that were not enough, Mr Johnson also clashed with his EU counterparts over Turkey, urging them not to lecture Ankara over the death penalty. And some EU leaders will not like Mrs May acknowledging the strength of Mr Trump's anti-globalisation arguments just as they prepare to do electoral battle with populist parties flying the same anti-establishment flag. So on the face of it, Britain is falling out with Europe over Mr Trump just when its overwhelming foreign policy objective should be preparing the way for Brexit, working closely with European allies to find the areas of common ground where a potential deal could be done. This should be a time for cool diplomacy, not hot-headed spats over who is going to which meeting. And all this before the tough decisions come. Responding to an election is one thing. It is quite another to choose sides when there are real policy dilemmas on the table. What happens if Mr Trump makes overtures to Russia and calls for sanctions over Ukraine to be reduced? What happens if Mr Trump ends US support for Syrian rebels and orders the US military to join forces with Russia against the Islamic State group? This was the one issue of substance Messrs Trump and Putin discussed in their telephone call this week. And what happens if Mr Trump is true to his word and reduces the US commitment to Nato? All of these are policy choices that could see the UK not only reverse longstanding positions but also place itself at odds with either the US or the EU. This is the context for Mrs May's trip to Berlin on Friday where she will meet President Obama and four of her most important European counterparts, from Germany, France, Italy and Spain. The challenge for this untested, newly appointed prime minister will be to walk that traditional fine line between the US and Europe. She has to prepare the way for these tough policy decisions, urging Europe to engage with a president-elect who cannot be ignored. But equally she will be under some pressure to make it clear to the travelling Americans that Britain will not roll over and accept automatically whatever foreign policy emerges from a Trump-led Washington. The UK-US relationship is hardly special at the moment. Mr Trump has shown no hesitation at embarrassing Mrs May by giving Nigel Farage a photo-opportunity at Trump Towers, giving the impression that the UKIP leader is filling a vacuum left by the Foreign Office. Mr Obama has chosen to visit Greece and Germany and not the UK on a valedictory European tour and in a news conference described Chancellor Merkel as \"probably.... my closest international partner these eight years.\" In vain did David Cameron flip those burgers in the Downing Street garden with the president. As the one time US Secretary of State Dean Acheson once wrote: \"Of course a unique relation existed between Britain and America.... but unique did not mean affectionate.\" So the task now for the British government is to engage with Mr Trump's incipient administration and do what it can - if anything - to shape and influence his foreign policy before firm positions are established. Officials recognise there is a window of opportunity in the coming weeks that should not be wasted that could set the terms for discussions about trade and security. Mrs May is pushing for an early meeting with Mr Trump before the inauguration in January.

Officials insist that these discussions began before Mr Farage began claiming his ambassadorial role with Mr Trump. But at the same time, the government also has to ensure that this process of engagement with the US does not make Brexit harder by losing what little political support it still has in Europe's chancelleries. The former Chancellor George Osborne told ITV this week that Britain's focus should be on Europe. \"For the first time really, the most important decisions over the next few years are going to be about our relationship with Europe, not about our relationship with the United States,\" he said. In the past few months, the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump have overturned many of Britain's traditional foreign policy assumptions.

He rejected criticism from those who say he is mistaking the enthusiasm of his backers for wider electoral appeal. Ex-leader Neil Kinnock said Labour appeared unelectable under Mr Corbyn and faced its \"greatest crisis.\" Labour will announce whether Mr Corbyn or Owen Smith have won the leadership contest on 24 September. Ahead of the vote, Mr Smith accused Mr Corbyn of seeking to \"deepen divisions\" between the party's membership - seen as overwhelmingly in favour of the leader - and its MPs - who are largely opposed to him. But asked if he would quit as leader if he thought he could not take the party to power, Mr Corbyn told Today he was \"determined\" to lead it into the next general election and said it could win.

{"original_text": "Figures shared with 5 live Investigates by the charity RoadPeace reveal a 23 drop in prosecutions in England and Wales in the five years to 2015. In the same period the number of convictions fell by nearly 30 per cent. The charity blames a reduction in the number of specialist police officers. The number of road officers in England and Wales fell by nearly 40 per cent from 7,100 in 2005 to 4,350 in 2014. The Department for Transport said: \"Britain has some of the safest roads in the world and in 2015 we had the second lowest total of road fatalities on record. \"We are determined to do more and we've recently announced tougher penalties for those caught using a mobile phone while driving. \"We have also tightened the law to make it easier to prosecute drink-drivers and drug-drivers.\" Five people die on the UK's roads in the UK every day but campaigners say these incidents are often seen as unfortunate accidents and prosecutions are few and far between. John Thompson's 27-year-old son Jake died from head injuries in 2011 after he was hit on a pedestrian crossing in Bristol by a lorry travelling at 38mph in a 30mph zone. The family had to fight to persuade Avon and Somerset Police to re-open an investigation into Jake's death after the Crown Prosecution Service said there wasn't enough evidence to bring charges against the driver. John is highly critical of the original investigation. He said: \"We thought straight after the crash there would've been statements taken. It was about a month before the witnesses were interviewed, the phones weren't checked, the interview of the driver didn't take place until about two or three months afterwards and the interview failed to meet the standards which you would expect. \"There hadn't been a proper investigation. They hadn't followed up on certain key leads like CCTV evidence; they hadn't checked the driver's medical history.\" When the case was eventually taken to court in 2014, it was thrown out, with the judge ruling that there was no case to answer. \"I felt hurt, disappointed,\" said John. \"It was almost as if Jake's life had been lost but there were no consequences as far as the legal system was concerned.\" A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said: \"After the collision involving Jake we carried out an investigation which, when reviewed, was found to have fallen below standards. Following a complaint raised by Mr and Mrs Thompson we recognised and accepted the need to revisit these matters. \"As a result, the investigation was re-opened and we renewed our appeal for witnesses, reviewed the information we already had and looked to see if any new lines of enquiry had presented themselves in the interim period. Improvements have since been made in respect of how we approach these types of investigations.\" RoadPeace believes that the declining number of prosecutions for careless and dangerous driving reflects the police's increasing reluctance to investigate fatal collisions. \"Police are not evaluated on their collision investigation performance. Hence it is not a priority,\" said Amy Aeron Thomas from RoadPeace. \"There are no national standards for collision investigation, not even for fatal crashes. Guidance exists but has been weakened in recent years. It is not clear how police evaluate their investigation effectiveness, or if they even do evaluate this.\" The Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS) - a charity which advises MPs on road safety - wants the government to create a UK road collision investigation branch. This would be similar to existing organisations which investigate air and rail crashes, and would have the remit of reducing the number of road casualties. Steve Barry, an Assistant Chief Constable at Sussex Police and the National Police Chief's Council lead for collision investigations, says he doesn't believe that the reduction in the number of traffic police has impacted on the number of prosecutions and convictions. He supports the idea of a national investigation branch but says there is a now a very different approach to road safety. \"It's less focused on enforcement and prosecution, it's more focused on what is in the public interest, in terms of educating the public, diverting them away from the court. \"We need to learn how to keep ourselves safe on the roads, as oppose to prosecuting our way into a situation of better safety. \"The balance is between justice and public interest, or learning, and that's a really difficult balance to explain to a [bereaved] family, but what we have to try and explain is there is a balance between justice, for the victims, justice for the families, at the same time of getting as much evidence, as much learning out of it that informs how we keep other people safe on the roads in future.\" 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live, 2 April at 11:00 GMT - catch up on BBC iPlayer Radio.

{"original_text": "It forced the band to remain anonymous for almost a year: No photographs, no interviews, no videos. But there was an upside. Last year, as she caught a train home from Heathrow, she sat next to a passenger \"covered in blood [with] no teeth, looking sorry for himself.\" \"I tentatively went up to him and his girlfriend and said,'I just wanted to let you know you'll be fine',\" recalls the 27-year-old. Go to the dentist tomorrow, don't panic, you'll be great'. And he was like,'Oh, thank you so much!'. \"And then this guy opposite us piped up,'I broke my nose, too!'. And suddenly this whole little carriage was talking about their injuries, which was remarkable. \"When I got off the Tube, I was so excited. Chatting to strangers gives you such a buzz because there's that element of fear before you talk to someone. \"So I walked from Brockley station back to my house, singing into my phone. And I've got this really funny voice note, which is like,'I'm getting high on humans! Later, Josephine sent the melody to her musical partner, Anthony West, saying, \"We have to write a song about this tomorrow.\" \"I just sent a text back saying,'You're crazy, he laughs, but the demo was worked up into a full song, High on Humans, which features on the band's upcoming second album, Ultralife. Like her Tube journey, the song tingles with nervous energy, capturing that extraordinary feeling of connecting with other people; a theme that runs through the record. The duo were moved to write about \"what it means to be a human in this day and age\" after a head-spinning two years, in which their music became an online phenomenon, resulting in a record deal and a tour that ran to more than 200 shows around the world. The success caught them completely off guard. Oh Wonder was conceived as a songwriting project, whereby the two musicians could subsidise their solo careers by giving songs to other artists. In September 2014, they created a Soundcloud page and, prompted to describe themselves, wrote: \"Writing duo, one song a month.\" \"We thought it was a good way to build up a portfolio over a year,\" explains Josephine. Then their first song, Body Gold, amassed 100,000 plays in just three days. \"We thought it was a fluke,\" says Anthony. \"But then we uploaded something the next month, and the same thing happened. And it just kept snowballing. \"On the first of every month, we'd go to a little coffee shop and just release a song and thousands of people would play it. It was amazing. It was the best year ever.\" Initially, they stayed incognito - partly because of their mantra \"it's about the art, not the artist,\" but mainly because of Josephine's injuries. \"I had no teeth,\" she grimaces. \"It was a really ill-timed accident.\" \"For a while, she had a little lisp,\" adds Anthony, who had to edit all of his partner's vocals to remove the erroneous \"esses.\" Recording on a budget of just PS200, they hit upon a vocal style where both musicians sing in unison, with Josephine's voice in the centre, and Anthony singing twice, once in the left ear and once in the right. The technique was actually a happy accident - they'd recorded two sets of vocals so the songs could be pitched to both male and female artists, but their managers advised them to blend the two takes, and it became Oh Wonder's unique sonic signature. Fans, it seemed, couldn't get enough of it. \"Because we released a song a month over a long period, our fans had a year of their lives soundtracked by our music,\" says Josephine. \"Rather than just,'Oh, I really like that song you did,' we get,'You released that song when I was at university or I had moved to a different country'. We get the most heart-warming stories. Hundreds a week.\" Anthony recalls a gig in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where a 50-year-old woman approached the band to express her gratitude for the band's music. Her son, who had recently died of cancer, had been a fan. In his final months, they would wait on tenterhooks for every new release. \"When he died, she was with him and they were listening to his favourite song,\" says Anthony. \"And she said,'I thank you so much because now, when I listen to that song, my son is there with me. Stories like that helped alleviate the drudgery and loneliness of touring - \"when you go from 3,000 people screaming your name to being back in the dressing room, on your own, eating a yoghurt.\" Being whisked around the world has changed the two musicians in ways they never expected. \"I've found that I've become fiercely loyal now,\" says Josephine. \"If someone has an engagement party and I've said I will be there, I will cancel everything, even if it really compromises things, in order to make it.\" And that, in a nutshell, is what Ultralife - both the album and its title track - is about. \"You and I will both have days where we're really sad, like,'it's Friday night and I'm in on my own and there's no food in the fridge and I'm miserable, says Josephine. \"And the next day you wake up and you're like,'I feel fantastic, I feel so liberated and empowered and I have loads of mates and it's incredible.' \"Ultralife is the word we use to symbolise the someone or something in your life that pulls you out of those trickier moments and into the celebratory, ultra version of yourself.\" So who is that person for Oh Wonder? \"We haven't been asked that yet!\" laughs Josephine, before Anthony chips in with a vague answer about friends and family. Many assume the duo are a real-life couple - but they have been doggedly reluctant to discuss a potential romance, even though they live together and have an uncanny knack for finishing each other's sentences. \"People think we're brother and sister, which suits us just fine,\" Josephine told one interviewer. Instead, they want the focus to be their music, which they wrote eyeball-to-eyeball over a piano in a rented AirBB apartment in New York. Compared to their first album, Ultralife is \"pumped full of energy,\" a direct response to the audience's reactions on their last tour. Sonically, it's a big leap forward, while retaining all of the breathless boy-girl beauty of their debut. The band don't want the album to propel them to Beyonce levels of fame I think it would just be very lonely,\" says Josephine), but it could jeopardise their chances of striking up anonymous conversations on the Tube. Which, as Anthony attests, could be a blessing. \"I once sat with a Danish friend on the Tube,\" he says, \"And there was two girls opposite me talking in a foreign language. \"Later, my friend told me they were Danish, too, and they were tearing into my shoes, talking about how awful they were. \"I thought they were quite normal shoes, honestly.\" Oh Wonder's new album, Ultralife, is released on 14 July by Island Records.

England's second tier, the Championship, spent PS42.4m on agents, an increase of 62. The Football Association figures cover from February 2016 to January 2017. They come two years after the last full-year results (2014-15). Premier League teams spent a record PS1.38bn on transfers in the 2016-17 season - a 43 increase on transfer spending from the 2014-15 season. In both League One and League Two the total spending on agents and intermediaries decreased from the 2014-15 figures. League One sides spent PS3,098,508, down from PS3,167,964, while League Two teams spent PS821,450, down from PS1,007,920. Liverpool led the Premier League in agents' fees when the last full-year results were published for the period 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015, but the Reds' spending has decreased from PS14.3m to PS13.8 for the 2016-17 period.

Former England, West Ham and QPR winger Trevor Sinclair I was very fortunate. I met a good agent quite early on in my career after some bad experiences. He took care of negotiations, which is standard, made sure I was pitching myself at the right amount of money to be earning weekly, monthly, annually. On top of that he helped me with financial advice, he helped me with marketing, exit strategies when I finished football, and also just day-to-day things. He was always preaching to do your best and try to look after yourself. The influence that agents have got now in the game is unbelievable. You look at some of the biggest clubs in the UK and Europe, and there are certain super agents who, for me, have too much power. In relation to deals, I think the money should be capped in some way. If you're doing a deal for a player moving for PS1m, why would there be another PS1m going missing to agents' fees? It's unacceptable, for me, that kind of money going out of the game, when that could be easily used for grassroots football. Jonathan Barnett of the Stellar Group Agents have a bad reputation because nobody really understands what an agent does and that includes, probably, the FA. It's not deserved. More MPs have committed illegal acts than agents. I think it's unjust, a very unjust one. People get confused when they hear of an agent. They think it's somebody that does transfers, runs around from one club to another trying to sell players. They are more traders and brokers. There are very few of those agents and very few that really matter. However, what we are as an agency and what other reputable companies are, are people who look after players. We don't look after clubs. We don't look after anybody else, we look after the player.

You've got to be good at what you do and then you get paid rightly. Stoke City chairman Peter Coates Football clubs, especially top clubs, are getting more and more income, so what happens? Players get bigger and bigger wages, and agents therefore get bigger and bigger fees. It's a product of the marketplace we're in, so I'm not surprised. I wish it were less, but we're in a marketplace that is highly competitive. We've never been able to get any traction and get an agreement to say we'll all dock pay more than X, whether it's 5, 10 or whatever the figure could be. There seems a reluctance to go down that route. There's no other way we could perhaps rein in what agents get. There are good agents, less good agents and they can earn huge amounts of money.

The meeting was a second attempt at finalising the deal after Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly announced in July that she wanted time to scrutinise it. With her approval now granted and the contracts updated, the formal signing took place at a ceremony attended by Business Secretary Greg Clark and French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.

Mr Clark said that signing the contract was a \"crucial moment\" and that Hinkley played \"an important part in ensuring our future low-carbon energy security.\" Mr Ayrault said he was pleased that the UK government had decided to go ahead with the project. QA: What is Hinkley Point and why is it important? How much would Hinkley C cost bill payers? What does China get out of Hinkley? Dozens of contracts running to thousands of pages for the huge project in Somerset are believed to have been prepared ahead of the event. The key document is the Contract for Difference, or CfD, which gives a guaranteed price for the electricity Hinkley will generate for 35 years. In return EDF, along with CGN, will finance the project and shoulder the risk of any delays. Critics say the guaranteed \"strike price\" - which is more than twice the current wholesale cost of electricity - will provide a windfall for EDF for decades to come. The formal go-ahead for Hinkley also cements China's foothold in Britain's nuclear industry. The last government signed a series of co-operation agreements in civil nuclear power with Beijing which opened the UK's market to Chinese firms. CGN will pay about a third of the cost of Hinkley. Under its agreement with EDF, it will also have a stake in a new plant at Sizewell in Suffolk. The Chinese will then be allowed to develop their own reactor technology at Bradwell in Essex, subject to planning and regulatory approvals. The government is now expected to publish some of the key documents linked to the deal. These will include the Contract for Difference and the waste transfer agreement that covers nuclear waste generated by the plant. After numerous delays, EDF's board agreed to proceed with the controversial project back in July. But just weeks after taking office, Prime Minister Theresa May ordered a review of the deal, leading to questions over the UK's openness to foreign investment. Her government gave its approval two weeks ago on condition that it could prevent EDF from selling its controlling stake before completion of the project. EDF's board approved the new terms on Tuesday, paving the way for the formal signing of the deal.

But what do other countries do? In most well-populated countries, women are free to change their surname on marrying, if they wish. Many go further than that, putting in place laws stating that women do not have to change their names. France's law has been in place since the 18th century but, much like in Italy, there is some flexibility allowing wives to use their husband's surnames in an informal way. On all official paperwork, however, the maiden name must remain. The laws are much tougher in Greece and Quebec. In Greece, you must petition a court for a name change, and in Quebec, even if they wanted to, a wife cannot take her husband's surname at any point. In Iceland, women keep their maiden names after marriage. A surname is derived from a father's first name - so Bjork, Gudmund's daughter, becomes Bjork Gudmundsdottir - or, in certain circumstances, the mother's. A similar pattern is also followed in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where there is no concept of surnames as known in many Western countries. At birth, people are given one name, that is then followed by the father's name then the grandfather's name. Even after marrying, women retain their original three names.

In practice the latest attacks on the aid convoy and hospital seem to have taken things back to square one. Indeed the cynicism of the attack on the convoy in particular is remarkable. The Russians have shown drone footage of their monitoring of the convoy, the route and location of which were pre-announced. But what happened next is disputed. The Americans are hinting strongly that the convoy was attacked from the air by a pair of Sukhoi Su-24 jets - either Russian or Syrian. It makes little difference to Washington, which holds Moscow responsible either way. In contrast, the Russians deny any culpability; they say their aircraft were not in the area and that the destruction of the convoy was the result of action on the ground - the implication is from rebel forces. Quite what purpose anyone had in destroying the convoy is unclear, other than to jeopardise the ceasefire. But the seeds of its collapse were there from the outset. Firstly, the ceasefire was negotiated not between the warring parties on the ground but by two of their patrons - the US and Russia - who are both engaged in the conflict, in different ways and with very different goals. The Syrian Government and the various rebel factions were not involved. Secondly, neither the Russians nor the Americans were able to convince their allies to accept the deal. Moscow had the easier job, to convince the Assad regime, which is hugely dependent upon Russia. The Americans were able to convince some of the rebel groups to back the deal - but many others did not. Indeed many of them have no particular relationship with the Americans. Furthermore, the complex and untidy nature of the Syrian battlefield with multiple localised conflicts going on across the country, prosecuted by a variety of actors, made the idea of any ceasefire difficult from the outset. The idea that the guns should fall silent in one war - between the Assad government and a variety of rebel groups - while the US and Russia put their foot on the accelerator in another battle against IS is a little bizarre. Any hammering of IS would create local vacuums into which one or other actor, the government or the rebels, might step. In any case many at the Pentagon (and probably one would imagine some inside the Russian Defence Ministry as well) were far from enthusiastic about the proposed joint military campaign against IS. If there was insufficient trust at the outset, then the attack on the aid convoy and the recriminations between Washington and Moscow now, have only made matters worse. The conflict seems to be heading for a brutal stalemate as the fighting continues. The Assad regime is too weak to retake all the areas of the country it has lost. The rebel opposition too weak to seriously challenge it beyond the areas it already holds. The Kurds as well as the Turkish incursion into Syria add an additional level of complexity to the problem.

In any case many at the Pentagon ( and probably one would guess some inside the Russian Defence Ministry as well ) were far from enthusiastic about the proposed joint military campaign against IS. If there was insufficient trust at the outset , then the attack on the aid convoy and the recrimination between Washington and Moscow now , have only made matters worse. The conflict look to be heading for a brutal stalemate as the fighting continues. The Assad regime is too weak to retake all the areas of the country it has turn a loss. The rebel opposition too weak to seriously challenge it beyond the region it already holds. The Kurds as well as the Turkish incursion into Syria add an additional level of complexness to the problem. And as mentioned above the continued assault on IS will change the strategical map in Syria whatever happens elsewhere. ", "label": 1}

Russia's space agency says Progress M-27M is now orbiting in an uncontrolled spin. It cannot reach the ISS and is likely to break up on re-entering Earth's atmosphere. The craft carried on to a higher orbit after contact was lost. Igor Komarov, the head of Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, said: \"The craft's continued flight and its docking with the ISS is not possible.\" Two astronauts spending a year on the ISS, Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko, told the Associated Press news agency that flight controllers had given up hope of controlling Progress again. Progress is likely to re-enter Earth's atmosphere some time between 5 and 7 May. Other capsules - including one Progress craft last year - have burned up and disintegrated on re-entering Earth's atmosphere without posing a threat to the planet's population. Cathleen Lewis, a specialist in Russian space programmes at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, said it was not yet known where debris will fall - but that it was highly unlikely to hit urban areas. \"I always remind people that two-thirds of Earth's surface is water,\" she said. \"The likelihood of it coming down and hitting someone is so remote as to be minuscule.\" The problem with the loss of the Progress is that it puts further pressure on the volume of stores held on the space station. ISS managers like to keep a good six months' supply of food, water, fuel and other resources in reserve at all times. Currently, however, this volume is somewhat depleted - in part because of the explosion on launch last year of the American Cygnus freighter. The responsibility for keeping the stores topped up leans heavily on Progress and the second American freighter, Dragon. The latter is due to make its next supply run in June. As long as it keeps working well, ISS officials in Houston and Moscow will not be unduly concerned. If, for some reason, supplies did become marginal, the space agencies would simply reduce the size of the normal six-person crew until matters could be improved.

Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 31. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as \"What Happened, If It Happened.\" Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism.
