{"original_text": "Cricket and Nigeria may seem an incongruous pairing, but in Lagos many a weekend players in their colourful kit take to the crease on a dusty pitch in a fiercely competitive cricket league. \"This league actually boasts about 99 of the Nigerian national team,\" says Femi Solebo, who chairs the Club Cricket Committee Lagos and also plays for the Ibeju Lekki Cricket Club. Watching a game from the welcome shade of the pavilion, he occasionally shouts out instructions to his batsmen taking on Government College Ibadan in a 50-over game. \"Over the last three or four years Nigerian cricket has stepped up quite a lot and has allowed these guys here to show their stuff at an international level,\" he says. \"Recently the national team got promoted to division five in the World Cricket League, which is a huge achievement for us - we've never been there before in the history of Nigerian cricket.\" Mr Solebo, who first started playing cricket whilst at school in the UK, reckons that in a population of more than 170 million \"there must be a million or so followers of cricket in Nigeria quite easily.\" However, not many of them are at Tafawa Balewa Square Cricket Oval next to Lagos' dilapidated old racecourse. Besides a few team members on the stand and a man barbecuing meat, only a small group watches from deckchairs under a nearby tree, keeping refreshed with drinks from a cool box. Some of them turn out to be former Nigerian internationals - stalwarts of the game, some of whom are updating a chat group of enthusiasts with the latest scores by mobile phone. Femi Solebo, Club Cricket Committee Lagos chair: I joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me \"In our time we didn't have as much exposure as the current national team does, we were restricted in playing in just the West African region,\" says Barnaby Ephraim, who now helps administer the game in Lagos. He says it is the Lagos league, which was started more than 15 years ago, that has helped raise the profile of cricket and the opportunity to play it outside school and university. It is also tempering attitudes that see the game as elitist and old fashioned, with some schools - even the established private ones - not seeing the sport as a priority. And Mr Solebo admits it is difficult to rival football as there are not the fans to warrant tickets that would pay for the upkeep of a turf pitch. The ground the teams use is often rented out by the cash-strapped Nigerian Cricket Federation - and with upcoming elections, political rallies have recently been held here, playing havoc with the pitch, already like concrete after the dry Harmattan season. The game is also expensive for players given the kit needed. \"With soccer, all you need is just one ball and then you're away,\" says the 45-year-old. But he says whilst the league is sponsored by private individuals like him with a passion for the game, most of the 400 players in its two divisions are \"from the streets.\" The Ibeju Lekki club helps pay for either a player's education or vocational training - and subsidises kit and lunches. Kunle Adegbola, Nigerian cricket captain: Cricket is just evolving in Nigeria.... in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football \"Whatever it is they want to do, we'll fund that and insist that you can only be a member of this club if you have some kind of educational background - and that's what the other clubs try to do as well,\" says Mr Solebo, who runs a company that generates electricity. \"I joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me. \"Some of them are doing very well in university, some of them have left and are working now.\" A few of Lagos' cricketers have even gone professional, like Nigerian cricket captain Kunle Adegbola. The towering 33-year-old has come to practise for his Foundation Cricket Club in the nets ahead of a game the next day. When the season ends in April in Lagos he will head off to London, where he has played for Burgess Park and Blackheath cricket clubs in the past. He says with more awareness, spectators and sponsorship, he sees great things for Nigerian cricket. \"Cricket is just evolving in Nigeria.... in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football,\" he says. But the Lagosian cricketers know gaining such momentum will only be achieved with serious corporate sponsorship - which would be more likely if ongoing negotiations with a cable TV company bear fruit. So far TV executives have been reluctant to go ahead as they would prefer a national league. \"But we say that we can take it in phases, adopt Lagos first and then you can open up,\" says Mr Ephraim, vice-chair of the Lagos State Cricket Association which is also trying to rejuvenate youth interest in cricket. He says that unlike other states there are 35 schools in Lagos now playing cricket - with both boys and girls participating. Ibeju Lekki player Endurance Ofem agrees junior involvement is key to putting cricket on a football footing. But the former captain of the Nigerian side says offering national team players good welfare packages like those available to professional footballers is important too. \"If you do that, every youngster sees the reason to come and play cricket.\" For Mr Solebo, competing with football is not the issue - it is the cricket that matters. \"It makes me very proud that our efforts give people joy every weekend - they come here, play with passion and it's fantastic.\"", "text_perturb": "Cricket and Nigeria may seem an incongruous pairing , but in Lagos many a weekend players in their colourful kit take to the crease on a dusty pitch in a fiercely private enterprise cricket league. `` This league actually boasts about 99 of the nigerian national team , '' says Femi Solebo , who chairs the Club Cricket Committee Lagos and also plays for the Ibeju Lekki Cricket Club.

{"original_text": "The pop star was given the night's top honour for her multi-million selling record 25, but told the audience, \"I can't possibly accept this award.\" \"I'm very humbled and I'm very grateful, but Beyonce is the artist of my life.\" The British singer then appeared to break the award in two accidentally and offer a piece to her fellow nominee. Adele's victory over Beyonce is certain to boost complaints that the Grammys habitually overlook black artists. Several artists, including Frank Ocean and Kanye West, chose to skip this year's ceremony on that basis. Ocean even declined to submit his critically-acclaimed album, Blonde, for consideration, saying the Grammys did not \"seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down.\" Two years ago, West rushed onto the stage in protest when Beck's Morning Phase beat Beyonce's last LP in the best album race. However, Adele's 25 was by far the biggest-seller on this year's shortlist; outselling Beyonce's Lemonade by a factor of 10 to 1. It is unclear if Adele will officially reject her award. If she does, it would only be the second time in history that has happened. The last was in 1990, when Sinead O'Connor turned down best alternative album for I Do Not Want What I Have Not Got, claiming the ceremony was too \"commercialised.\" Main winners Whatever the outcome, Adele remains one of the night's biggest winners. She won five prizes in all, including three of the top four: Best album, song of the year and record of the year - the latter two both rewarding her 2015 comeback single, Hello. Chicago's Chance the Rapper also took three prizes, including best rap album for his self-released record Coloring Book. \"I know people think independence means you do it by yourself, but independence means freedom,\" he said as he picked up best new act at the start of the ceremony. Rock icon David Bowie won in each of the five categories he was nominated for, including best alternative album, for Blackstar, and best rock performance, for the album's title track. And Beyonce wasn't left completely empty-handed: she took home best urban contemporary album and best music video, for the politically-charged Formation. The star, who is pregnant with twins, also gave an ambitious and logistically complex performance of the songs Love Drought and Sandcastles, themed around the ideas of rebirth, regeneration and healing. Dressed in flowing, golden Egyptian robes and an elaborate headdress, she dedicated the performance to motherhood, proudly displaying her baby bump as she sang. But while Beyonce's performance was flawless, others were marred by technical issues. Lady Gaga duetted with Metallica on the song Moth to the Flame, but singer James Hetfield was inaudible throughout the first verse. He later sang cheek-to-cheek with Gaga, sharing her microphone, but angrily threw his guitar to one of his roadies at the end of the performance. Adele also went off-key during a tribute to George Michael, and tearfully asked if the song could be started again. It was, and she received a standing ovation for her troubles. Respects were paid to Sir George Martin, Leonard Cohen and other musicians we lost in 2016, while Bruno Mars honoured Prince by playing the star's trademark cloud guitar in a pitch-perfect rendition of Let's Go Crazy.

During the hearing, the judge was told that 42 fish were killed by the sewage after a \"large quantity\" of sewage filtered into Whitelake River.

The 2014 winner Vos won the 119km stage from Nottingham to Stoke in a sprint finish. Sunday's 113.2km final stage runs from Northampton to Kettering. Vos, who lost the yellow jersey to Armitstead on Friday, won in what was a reduced sprint, with only 20 riders at the front of the race to battle it out after the bulk of the day's climbing was packed into the second half of the stage. Boels Domans rider Armitstead had attacked along with Elisa Longo Borghini, Moolman-Pasio and Emma Johansson with a little under 20km remaining, catching and passing lone breakaway rider Emilia Fahlin. Armitstead said: \"The race stayed together until the climb and then me, Ashleigh and Elisa went on the second Queen of the Mountains [intermediate sprint]. Emilia was in no-man's land so she came back up to us. \"There was a bit of co-operation for maybe five kilometres and then Emma and Elisa started attacking.\" But the chasing pack, including Vos, battled back and caught them shortly before the 1km-to-go Flamme Rouge to set up the sprint finish. She added: \"In the final kilometres I could tell [the peloton] were coming back. \"Coming into the final kilometre there were a couple of turns with up-hill flickers and again Emma and Elisa were attacking, so it was just about covering them. \"As the group from behind pulled, I tried to put myself in a good position but got caught out a little bit on the last corner.\" Women's Tour 2016 - stage four result 1.

The coalition government rejected a minimum price for alcohol in 2013. Health ministers said they would look at the evidence carefully. The public health review says that alcohol is now more affordable and people are drinking more than they did 40 years ago, making it the leading risk factor for ill health, early death and disability in those aged 15 to 49 in England. More adults are non-drinkers but there are still more than 10 million people in England drinking at levels that could damage their health. The report suggests there were 167,000 years of working life lost to alcohol in 2015 - mainly among the young and middle-aged. It concludes that reducing the affordability of alcohol is the most cost-effective way of reducing alcohol harm.

{"original_text": "It was the famous Fairfield yard which took the Upper Clyde to great heights and worldwide prominence. The yard was founded in 1864 by William Elder, a talented marine engineer who developed the compound engine which transformed shipbuilding by allowing vessels to use fuel more efficiently and travel further. Under William Pearce from 1888, the company flourished, building luxurious ocean liners, steamers and naval ships for the world. At its peak before World War 1, the Fairfield shipyard was part of a local industry which directly employed 70,000 workers in 19 yards. The largest crane in the world, with a maximum lift capacity of 250 tons, was built at the Govan yard in 1911 and in the following year Fairfield had 12 ships under construction at the same time. The inter-war years saw a gradual decline but Clydeside's largest shipyard still built many famous ships and during wartime it was a major builder for the Royal Navy. But after World War 2, the decline set in swiftly and despite a major modernisation programme in the 1950s the yards of the Clyde were unable to compete with new shipbuilding superpowers such as Japan. By 1967 the receivers were called in and it looked as if the end had come for Fairfield and for shipbuilding in Govan. Sean Connery, at the height of his James Bond fame, made a documentary about problems besetting the yard, entitled The Bowler and the Bunnet. Among the footage of a community on the edge of oblivion was Connery riding a bicycle around empty shipyard fabrication sheds. The UK government's response to the crisis was to create the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS) in 1968, which had about 8,500 workers in five yards - Fairfield's and Stephens on the south bank, Connel's and Yarrow's on the north bank, and John Brown's at Clydebank. In 1971 UCS went into receivership and was refused a government loan. This led to one of the most famous episodes in industrial history - the work-in. The unions, led by Jimmy Reid and Jimmy Airlie, occupied the yard and made a demand of the then Conservative prime minister Edward Heath for the \"right to work.\" In February 1972, the government agreed to retain two yards, Yarrow at Scotstoun and Fairfield's at Govan. Fairfield's was formed into Govan Shipbuilders in 1972, which was itself later nationalised and subsumed into British Shipbuilders in 1977. The government of Margaret Thatcher broke up British Shipbuilders and denationalised it in 1988, when the former Fairfield yard was sold to the Norwegian Kvaerner group. Kvaerner took the yard through another modernisation programme to enable it to specialise in the construction of liquefied natural gas and chemical tankers. But in the late 1990s, the market became depressed and the yard had to find alternative contracts. The yard passed to BAE Systems in 1999 and has found work over the past decade making destroyers and aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy. BAE is a key partner in the construction of the two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers being built at the Portsmouth yard and in Scotland.

Deputy Interior Secretary Felipe Zamora Castro and the interior ministry's chief press officer Jose Alfredo Garcia Medina were also killed in the crash along with other government officials and the air force crew, Ms Sota said.

Ms Sota said the craft went down in the Xochimilco area, just south of Mexico City. By Ignacio de los ReyesBBC Mundo, Mexico Francisco Blake Mora was one of the president's right-hand men. Not only because he was in charge of domestic affairs, but also because he became one of the most strident voices of Mr Calderon's strategy against the drug cartels. In recent months, he helped co-ordinate the army, navy and federal police in the fight against drug trafficking in violence-torn cities like Veracruz or Acapulco. But his death could be a severe blow to Mr Calderon at a personal level too. Three years ago, one of the president's best friends, then Interior Secretary Juan Camilo Mourino, was killed in a plane crash in Mexico City. That accident was one of the saddest moments for Mr Calderon since he took power in 2006, he said. Mr Camilo Mourino was remembered by members of the cabinet, including Mr Blake Mora, this week. His last message on his Twitter account (FBlakeM) was actually dedicated to Mr Mourino. \"The cloudy conditions at the time certainly make you think about the probability of an accident,\" President Calderon said in a televised address. He said a thorough investigation of the accident was being launched and cancelled a trip to Hawaii for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum. US President Barack Obama called Mr Calderon to offer his condolences, a US government spokesman said. Mr Obama \"reinforced his commitment to the close partnership between the United States and Mexico in this difficult time,\" said US National Security Council spokesman Ben Rhodes. The interior secretary is Mexico's senior cabinet position and the top official after the president, with responsibility for domestic affairs and security. Mr Blake was Mr Calderon's fourth interior secretary. One of his predecessors, Juan Camilo Mourino, was killed in a plane crash in Mexico City three years ago. Mr Blake began his political career in the north-western border city of Tijuana in the mid-1990s, later serving as interior secretary for Baja California state. He also served as a federal congressman from Mr Calderon's National Action Party. He earned a reputation as being a hardliner in Mexico's struggle with drug cartels. Mr Blake Mora frequently travelled to cities badly affected by the cartels, such as Veracruz and Ciudad Juarez, to help co-ordinate the government's response.

{"original_text": "Yet again, you feel for the families of those killed on board, and the people that actually survived the ordeal. It seems never ending. In less than a year two Malaysian aircraft have been lost, with 537 people on board. The AirAsia accident - en route to Singapore in December - killed 162. It is not just the accidents. It's the fact that whole aircraft are going down without warning. You would be forgiven for thinking that flying is becoming more lethal. But you would be wrong. In fact, when you look at the number of crashes and fatalities compared to the huge number of people flying today (3.2 billion passengers last year), we are in a golden era of aircraft safety. According to safety analysts Ascend, 2014 was narrowly the safest year ever, with one fatal accident per 2.38 million flights, compared to every 1.91 million flights the year before. It must be noted that that does not include the loss of the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine, where 298 people died, which they count as a war loss rather than an accident. But even with that flight added it is not a terrible year, historically. Another respected organisation, the Aviation Safety Network, registers 21 fatal accidents in 2014 (this time including Ukraine), compared to 29 in 2013 and 23 the year before that. Nearly 1,000 people died in 2014, which is 700 more than the year before. Horrible numbers, but compare that to the worst year, 1972, when 2,370 passengers were killed - and far fewer people were flying then, maybe a quarter of the number travelling today. So why is flying getting safer? Well, technology. \"Think of your car in the 1970s,\" David Learmount, from Flightglobal tells me. \"The brakes, the handling, the lack of safety features. Well, aircraft are exactly the same. \"We knew most things about aerodynamics by the 1940s. What has changed is the technology.\" Every new generation of aircraft has been safer than the one before. Better computers, design, materials. But there is another sobering factor at play here too. Every tragedy has taught designers something new. Go back a couple of decades and the biggest killer was something called Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). A benign name with a morbid outcome, it normally involved a perfectly serviceable aircraft coming into land, then hitting something on the ground without the crew even knowing it was there. Many airports are near hills. Then along came a piece of equipment that was to transform safety: the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System. \"It's like a sat nav that can help you thread your way through hills and mountains, even in clouds,\" David says. Here is another example of how disaster has led to safer flying. In 1985 a British Airtours aircraft was taking off from Manchester Airport, en route to Corfu. The pilots aborted at the last minute because one of the engines failed, but the aircraft was also on fire. Fifty-four people died fleeing the smoke, the aisles were jammed with passengers panicking to get out. Next time you fly, look at the floor. You will probably see strip lights along both sides of the aisle, then they turn and lead to each exit. That idea comes straight from the Manchester fire. The lights mean passengers can find the exit, even crawling on their hands and knees through thick smoke. \"Our founder was actually working on emergency guide lights to help people escape from nuclear power stations and submarines,\" says Nigel Duncan, boss of STG aerospace. \"This accident made him realise they could be used in planes too.\" Nigel's company now supplies guiding lights for the floors of 9,000 airliners. They are photoluminescent, \"which means they are fail-safe.\" \"It's a chemical process so they don't need power - sever it and it still works,\" he says. For the most part, computers fly modern airliners. And they are very good at it. But all of this safety-driven automation has led to a new safety concern that is uncomfortable to hear. Pilots don't get enough practice at actually flying planes. The computer has taken them out of the loop. Six years ago, Air France flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic, killing 228 people. Yet there was nothing critically wrong with the plane. So why did it crash? Well, the weather was bad and a small tube froze up, knocking out the speed indicator. The actual speed was fine, but the speed data on their screens was all over the place. Suddenly, the computer didn't know how fast it was going, and it handed control back to the pilots. Confused, in bad weather, in darkness and taken by surprise, they couldn't work out what was happening, so they kept climbing to the point where the aircraft stalled, effectively stopping in mid-air and falling from the sky. Unsurprisingly, plenty in the industry want more hands-on training for pilots. \"A few years ago the airlines used to get more crew from the military and those guys were used to manually flying aircraft right on the edge,\" David Learmount tells me. \"Today, many pilots don't have that kind of background training.\" Having said all of that, just bear in mind: Nothing is ever without risk, but the chances of dying in an aircraft \"accident\" are lower than ever.", "text_perturb": "Yet once more , you feel for the families of those killed on board , and the people that actually survived the ordeal.

{"original_text": "It is a question that has long seemed impossible to answer, since players from different decades can never face each other at their peaks. Add in an element of nostalgia - who doesn't have a rose-tinted view of the teams they watched as a child? - plus the fact that fleeting glimpses of star players have been replaced by wall-to-wall television coverage, and it is quite a challenge to consider the merits of teams across eras. Here, with the help of SAM, the super computer built by Salford University professors Ian McHale, Rose Baker and others, BBC Sport assessed every side to have played an international match and analysed every international result. Taking into account a range of factors - including goals scored, goals conceded, the strength of the opposition faced and whether or not results were achieved in major tournaments - we have come up with the top 10 teams of all time. There are no English or Italian teams. As for the winners? You might well be surprised. Line-up: Sepp Maier, Berti Vogts, Franz Beckenbauer, Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck, Paul Breitner, Rainer Bonhof, Uli Hoeness, Wolfgang Overath, Jurgen Grabowski, Gerd Muller, Bernd Holzenbein. West Germany had come close to winning the World Cup twice in the preceding decade, losing 4-2 to England at Wembley in 1966 and 4-3 to Italy in a spectacular semi-final in Mexico four years later - so the stage was set for it to be third time lucky for veteran coach Helmut Schoen and his team as the host country in 1974. Media playback is not supported on this device They were guided on the pitch by an all-time great in the shape of Franz Beckenbauer. They had world-class defender Berti Vogts in their ranks. Wolfgang Overath was the midfield strategist and in attack they had the marksman supreme in Gerd Muller, scorer of 14 goals in 13 World Cup matches. Their meeting with the Netherlands in the final got off to the worst possible start when they conceded a first-minute penalty, but through sheer determination, and no little quality, they fought their way back to win through Paul Breitner's penalty and, inevitably, a winner from Muller. This West Germany side will not be remembered with the same fondness as some of the teams on this list but, like so many of their compatriots down the years, they got the job done. Line-up: Fabien Barthez, Lilian Thuram, Laurent Blanc, Marcel Desailly, Bixente Lizarazu, Patrick Vieira, Didier Deschamps, Youri Djorkaeff, Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry, Christophe Dugarry. Just look at that line-up! Built around star midfielder and three-time world player of the year Zinedine Zidane, this was the team that began the Euro 2000 final, a side so strong that two of Europe's finest players at the time, Robert Pires and David Trezeguet, could not get in the first XI. It was a group consisting largely of the players who won France's first World Cup in 1998, but with a few tweaks. Media playback is not supported on this device One, in particular, took the French to the next level. Out went striker Stephane Guivarc'h, scorer of just one goal in 14 internationals, and in came 22-year-old Thierry Henry, a forward who would go on to score 51 goals in an international career spanning 13 years. With Laurent Blanc in for Frank Leboeuf in defence, Patrick Vieira replacing Emmanuel Petit in midfield and attacker Christophe Dugarry taking Christian Karambeu's place, France became the first team in 26 years to win a World Cup and European Championship back-to-back - West Germany won the Euros in 1972 and followed that by claiming the 1974 World Cup. Line-up: Sergio Romero, Walter Samuel, Gabriel Heinze, Martin Demichelis, Nicolas Otamendi, Javier Mascherano, Maxi Rodriguez, Angel Di Maria, Gonzalo Higuain, Carlos Tevez, Lionel Messi. Think Argentina and the mind instantly conjures images of Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. Two iconic players, global superstars, both of whom led their sides to World Cup finals - Maradona winning one in 1986 and losing one in 1990, Messi losing out in 2014. But none of those three teams make it in to our top 10, and there is space for only one of Argentina's two most famous players. For all Maradona's individual brilliance, the 2010 side featuring Messi - as well as Carlos Tevez, Angel Di Maria and Gonzalo Higuain - are considered the best Argentina has produced. Bear in mind the fact Sergio Aguero was predominantly only a substitute and you get a sense of their attacking strength. \"To any football fan, it is odd that the results show that the 2010 team would beat the 1986 team,\" says Professor McHale. \"But there are some things that data and statistics can't pick up on - the human spirit, mental fortitude, attitude when things aren't going for you. There is only so much it can tell. \"The 1986 team lost 11 times in the three-year sample period, in part because they often played weakened teams in friendlies for a variety of reasons. That helps to explain why a team as brilliant as Maradona's 1986 side do not make the list.\" While Argentina 2010 are perhaps the surprise entry on this list, their results in the period suggest they deserve their place. Less than two months after Spain won the World Cup, the world champions were thrashed 4-1 in Buenos Aires, a result Argentina followed up two months later with a 1-0 win over Brazil. Line-up: Felix, Carlos Alberto, Everaldo, Brito, Piazza, Clodoaldo, Gerson, Jairzinho, Rivelino, Tostao, Pele. For many, the greatest team of all time. But not when judged by cold, hard stats. Pele led the way for Brazil during this period, but the names of his colleagues roll off the tongue as a list of the game's greats: captain Carlos Alberto, Gerson, Tostao, Jairzinho, Rivelino. Media playback is not supported on this device In 1970 alone, they played 14, won 12 and lost only once, scoring four or more goals five times. Therein lies part of the explanation as to why they do not feature further up the list - their opponents were often relatively weak, meaning victories earned them less credit in our ranking system. This team, though, were the stuff of fantasy, regrouping after a below-par performance in England four years earlier when Pele was kicked out of the tournament. Mexico 1970 was the great man's World Cup finale after his first win in Sweden in 1958 and he bade farewell in style. England pushed them closest in a classic group game in Guadalajara settled by Jairzinho's goal, and this was a team so good they were even able to carry a goalkeeping liability in Felix with no ill effects. The final against Italy in Mexico's Aztec Stadium was their showpiece. Goals from Pele, Gerson, Jairzinho and the brilliant flourish of passing to set up Carlos Alberto for the most famous goal in the 4-1 win was the crowning glory for an utterly brilliant side. Line-up: Jan Jongbloed, Ruud Krol, Wim Rijsbergen, Wim Suurbier, Wim Jansen, Arie Haan, Wim van Hanegem, Johan Neeskens, Johan Cruyff, Rob Rensenbrink, Johnny Rep. One of the greatest teams never to win the World Cup. The Dutch were masterly throughout the 1974 tournament, demonstrating a tactical and technical ability far above every other team, guided on the pitch by the brilliant Johan Cruyff and off it by the master of \"Total Football,\" the visionary coach Rinus Michels. Cruyff led a team full of talent in defender Ruud Krol, midfielders Arie Haan and Johan Neeskens as well as forwards Johnny Rep and Rob Rensenbrink. In the goalless draw against Sweden, the \"Cruyff turn\" was invented, as the great man bamboozled Jan Olsson with a piece of football ballet that will forever bear his name. The Netherlands then gave masterclasses against Argentina, who they beat 4-0, and the fading reigning champions Brazil, where they won 2-0. The victory was far more convincing than the scoreline suggests. There was a touch of arrogance about this side and it cost them in the final against West Germany in Munich. Instead of capitalising on Neeskens' first-minute penalty they wanted to humiliate their opponents - allowing the ruthless hosts to recover and claim the World Cup with a 2-1 win. Line-up: Manuel Neuer, Holger Badstuber, Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Philipp Lahm, Sami Khedira, Toni Kroos, Mesut Ozil, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Miroslav Klose, Thomas Muller This was the team that laid the foundations for the World Cup win that was to follow in 2014. A side which mixed the experience of Miroslav Klose (who would go on to become the all-time World Cup top scorer with 16 goals) and Bastian Schweinsteiger with a younger generation that included Manuel Neuer, Mesut Ozil and Thomas Muller, their quarter-final win against Greece at Euro 2012 was their 15th consecutive competitive victory. The defeat by Italy in the semi-finals of that tournament would prove to be little more than a blip, as Joachim Low's side embarked on a new run of 18 competitive matches unbeaten, a sequence which included a remarkable 7-1 thrashing of hosts Brazil and ended with a World Cup final victory against Argentina. Line-up: Julio Cesar, Dani Alves, Marcelo, Thiago Silva, David Luiz, Bernard, Paulinho, Oscar, Hulk, Neymar, Fred A year away from hosting their own World Cup, Brazil could hardly have been better positioned to succeed on home soil. An 11-game unbeaten run in 2013 culminated in five straight wins at the Confederations Cup, a tournament which doubled as a dry run for the main event the following summer. Not only did Brazil win that competition but they did so in style, beating France 3-0 and Italy 4-2 before hammering world and European champions Spain 3-0 in the final. They were the world's in-form team and, with Neymar as their talisman, continued their impressive record in to World Cup year, recording 10 wins in a row and 13 out of 14 in total. Yet for all that promise, this will be a team forever associated with one of the great humiliations in modern sport. A game away from a final at the Maracana in Rio, Brazil were 5-0 down to Germany in the semi-final inside 29 minutes and were eventually demolished 7-1. It was a one-off - Brazil went on to win 11 straight matches after the World Cup, including victories against Argentina and France - but that defeat by Germany is a result that will always define them. Line-up: Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Carles Puyol, Gerard Pique, Joan Capdevila, Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta, Xabi Alonso, Xavi, David Villa, Fernando Torres The inventors of tiki-taka, Spain imposed their own brand of football on the world from 2008 onwards, helped in no small part by the success of a Pep Guardiola-inspired Barcelona, whose players formed the core of the national team. With Andres Iniesta and Xavi the heartbeat of the side, Spain became the first team to win back-to-back European Championship titles (in 2008 and 2012), while they ended their wait for World Cup success when they became the first European nation to win the competition outside of their own continent by lifting the trophy in South Africa in 2010. It was a period of unprecedented dominance. Under Luis Aragones and then Vicente del Bosque, Spain set a new world record of 15 consecutive wins and went unbeaten for 35 matches. The team of 2010 boasts an 84 win percentage and the majority of the players above were involved in all three tournament successes, but that is not quite enough to make the top two. Line-up: Claudio Taffarel, Cafu, Roberto Carlos, Aldair, Marcio Santos, Dunga, Juninho, Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Bebeto, Romario Brazil went unbeaten from November 1993 to January 1996, a period stretching 28 games, taking in a World Cup win and including victories against Argentina (twice), Netherlands and England, among many others. Their scintillating form continued, as they lost just once in 20 matches in the 1996-97 season, a campaign which culminated in a Copa America triumph. Those runs are hardly surprising when you look at the players at manager Mario Zagallo's disposal - he had three of Brazil's six all-time leading goalscorers to choose from. Ronaldo, scorer of 15 World Cup goals, was just three years in to his international career in 1997, working his way into a team which could boast two of the leading scorers at the 1994 World Cup - Romario (five) and Bebeto (three). Not a bad array of attacking power. This side was made up of a group of players who won that World Cup and were beaten finalists in 1998 - a rare example of a team maintaining its strength over a four-year cycle and reaching consecutive finals. Line-up: Gyula Grosics, Jeno Buzanszky, Mihaly Lantos, Borzsei Janos, Jozsef Zakarias, Jozsef Bozsik, Zoltan Czibor, Ferenc Szusza, Ferenc Puskas, Nandor Hidegkuti, Sandor Kocsis Hungary, the best team of all time? Bear with us... The Mighty Magyars dominated world football in the early 1950s, inspired by the genius of Ferenc Puskas. This was a team embarking on a run of more than four years without defeat, and they would go on to reach the 1954 World Cup final. In 1953 they humiliated England, a stunning 6-3 victory at Wembley exposing the Three Lions' deficiencies as they lost a home game to a non-British or Irish team for the first time. England hoped for revenge in May of the following year in the return fixture but were left embarrassed once more as they were thrashed 7-1 in Budapest. So strong was the Puskas led-side that, in that summer's World Cup, they would beat West Germany 8-3 and South Korea 9-0 in surely the greatest show of group-stage strength even seen at a major tournament. They were only denied World Cup glory by the Miracle of Bern, with the West Germans defying the odds and memories of that heavy defeat weeks earlier to win the final 3-2 - after Hungary had gone 2-0 ahead in the opening 10 minutes. An ankle injury suffered by Puskas meant he was not fully fit in that game, hampering the Hungarians' attempts to cement their place as the world's greatest side. For Hungary, their team of the time was perhaps the ultimate example of a \"golden generation.\" As the graph below shows, it has pretty much been downhill ever since. Here's how the top three nations look when plotted alongside one another. No English team makes it into the top 10, but which Three Lions side does the super computer rate as the best? Despite the 1966 squad winning the World Cup, it is actually the team from 1986 that comes out as the strongest England has produced. With Gary Lineker the tournament's leading scorer, who knows how far they might have gone - and where they would appear in our top 10 - had Maradona and the Hand of God not intervened?

Line-up : Gyula Grosics , Jeno Buzanszky , Mihaly Lantos , Borzsei Janos , Jozsef Zakarias , Jozsef Bozsik , Zoltan Czibor , Ferenc Szusza , Ferenc Puskas , Nandor Hidegkuti , Sandor Kocsis Hungary , the best team of all clock time ? Bear with us. . . The Mighty Magyars dominated world football game in the early 1950s , inspired by the genius of Ferenc Puskas. This was a team embarking on a streak of more than four years without defeat , and they would go on to reach the 1954 World Cup final. In 1953 they humiliated England , a stunning 6-3 victory at Wembley exposing the Three Lions ' deficiencies as they lost a home game to a non-British or irish team for the first time. England hoped for revenge in May of the following year in the return fixture but were left embarrassed once more than as they were thrashed 7-1 in Budapest. So strong was the Puskas led-side that , in that summer 's World Cup , they would beat West Germany 8-3 and South Korea 9-0 in surely the greatest show of group-stage strength even view at a major tournament. They were only denied World Cup glory by the Miracle of Bern , with the West Germans defying the odds and memories of that heavy defeat weeks earlier to win the final 3-2 - after Hungary accept gone 2-0 ahead in the opening 10 minutes. An ankle injury suffered by Puskas meant he was not fully fit in that game , hampering the Hungarians ' attempts to cement their place as the world 's greatest side of meat. For Hungary , their team of the sentence was perhaps the ultimate example of a `` golden generation. `` As the graph below shows , it has pretty much live downhill ever since. Here 's how the top three nations wait when plotted alongside one another. No English team makes it into the top 10 , but which Three Lions side does the super computer rate as the best ? Despite the 1966 squad winning the existence Cup , it is actually the team from 1986 that comes out as the strongest England has produced. With Gary Lineker the tournament 's leading scorer , who have sex how far they might have gone - and where they would appear in our top 10 - had Maradona and the Hand of God not intervened ?

Scientists say their initial studies suggest that the object - catalogued as V774104 - is some 500-1,000km across. It will need to be tracked over time to learn the shape and extent of its orbit through the Solar System. The discovery was announced at the 47th annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences, taking place in National Harbor near Washington DC. The team behind the find is led by Scott Sheppard, from the Carnegie Institution for Science, and Chad Trujillo, from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. They specialise in detecting Solar System outliers. The previously recognised most distant object is the dwarf planet Eris. This body, which has a moon, Dysnomia, moves between 5.7 billion km and 14.6 billion km from the Sun. To put some of these numbers in context: Earth is 149 million km from the Sun, and even the most distant major planet - Neptune - seems close at 4.5 billion km, by these standards. That said, the Voyager 1 probe is further away - just. The epic robotic explorer has now ventured 20 billion km from home. The big question is whether V774104 sweeps inwards from its present location, like Eris, or outwards, like the objects known as 2012 VP113 and Sedna. These bodies are currently slightly closer in than Eris, but investigations of their orbits show they will reach far deeper into space, out to 66 billion km and 140 billion km, respectively. Models for Solar System formation suggest that such objects were probably not created in these weird, eccentric orbits. One explanation is that they have been perturbed gravitationally and pulled on to their strange trajectories by a passing planet - perhaps one that was expelled from our Solar System early in its history.

{"original_text": "Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region. For many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration. Mr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame. A mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught. To use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over. But he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore. The diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma. Since 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism. Domestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime. He was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship. His message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised \"lowlanders\" in Oromia and Ogadenia. His concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order. Measured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring. The much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele. But it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty. The democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed \"work in progress,\" has long stalled. Since the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents. Why West will miss Meles Obituary: Meles Zenawi Life in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi A plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time. Feeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival. He orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents. His death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising. That said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus. The opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up. Mr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically. He is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums. He did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable. Not in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse. From the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought. Many embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called \"new breed\" of African leaders. The Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests. He swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to \"tame\" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991. The two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea. Hostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border. It is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension. That would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond. In Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab.

He first noticed the issue in March 2014 and contacted Asda to report it. Asda said it had now fixed the problem and no customers had been affected. The firm, whose website is run by US retail giant Walmart, told the BBC: \"Asda and Walmart take the security of our websites very seriously. We are aware of the issue and have implemented changes to improve the security on our website.\" \"The points flagged pose a low risk to customers and our monitoring of these security issues indicate that no customer information has been compromised over that two-year period.\" Since Mr Moore went public with the information it has acted to improve its security. \"The small risk to customer information has been removed and an update has been applied, we're now adding further enhancements which will be completed by this evening. In short, one of the two issues is fixed but nothing that remains poses any risk to any customer information or card details,\" it told the BBC. The issue occurred because of two well-known exploits, cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), which combined, can offer hackers access to all the information users put on the site, said Mr Moore. It means that - if someone had both the Asda website open and another site that is infected with malware - they could be vulnerable to attack. \"CSRF exploits the trust a site has in the user's browser, allowing an attacker to issue requests on your behalf and from your own PC.

{"original_text": "Carlos Ghosn said there was a need to build a \"much higher awareness\" of the company's products in Brazil. When Nissan took the decision to back the Games, the Brazilian market was booming with sales of 3.8 million vehicles a year. But a recession has seen that sales figure tumble to 2 million a year. \"Without any doubt it's the right decision, the idea was to give more awareness to the Nissan brand,\" he told the BBC. The company's goal with the Olympics sponsorship is to help increase its market-share in Brazil from 3 to 5, he said. The 31st Olympic Games officially start in Rio on Friday with the opening ceremony at the Maracana Stadium. As part of its sponsorship, Nissan is supplying 5,000 cars for the Games and the Brazilian Olympic team to use. The company has used Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt in its adverts since 2012. Mr Ghosn says the global car market will continue to be sluggish until 2019, with growth of just 1 next year. He expects the US car market to be strong, and sees Europe continuing to recover \"even though it will be impacted by Brexit.\" The UK economy will see some contraction due to Brexit, \"not because there is anything wrong with the UK, but because markets hate uncertainty,\" Mr Ghosn said.

{"original_text": "As Abid Naseer started his cross-examination in a New York courtroom of the police officer who searched his Manchester bedroom in 2009, he commented it was nice to hear a Mancunian accent again. Six years ago, the Pakistani national had been living in the north-west English city where he plotted to kill hundreds in a bombing attack at the city centre's Arndale shopping complex during Easter weekend. Naseer, who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013, was convicted of providing and conspiring to provide material support to al-Qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device. Defending himself at his trial in New York, the 28-year-old was polite, calm and professional. He denied he was involved in any form of extremism. But, according to the police officer who headed up the British investigation into his activities, his courtroom conduct was a performance designed to con the jury. In a cafe overlooking the Brooklyn courthouse where the trial was held, Det Supt Mark Smith said Naseer was a good actor, an al-Qaeda trained terrorist and a man with a determination to kill hundreds of people. He said: \"He has had lots of time to develop his Westernised social skills, but I would say don't be fooled. Beneath that cool, relaxed exterior is a cold, calculated terrorist.\" Held in custody in the US ahead of his trial, Naseer had spent the months preparing his legal case and working out. One police officer commented that he had doubled in size since he was handcuffed and led away from a Cheetham Hill house in April 2009. Were it not for his arrest, detectives are convinced he would have gone ahead with a \"mass-casualty\" attack in Manchester city centre. Based upon intelligence gathered and the plots devised by other terrorists trained at the same al-Qaeda camp in Pakistan, police have pieced together what they believe would have happened. Emails sent from an internet cafe near Naseer's home had been intercepted in the weeks before his arrest. The final message led police to believe an attack was imminent. Known as the \"Hi Buddy\" email because of the way it greeted an al-Qaeda operative, it reads: \"I met with Nadia family and we both parties have agreed to conduct the nikah after the 15th and before 20th of this month. I have confirmed the dates from them and they said you should be ready between these dates.\" The jury was told female names, including Nadia, represented different ingredients used to make bombs. Wedding, or'nikah', was a standard al-Qaeda code for a terror attack. Based on the Islamic calendar, investigators believed this email was referring to a planned attack during the Easter weekend in 2009. Other evidence included photos of Naseer's friends standing in front of the main entrances to the Arndale centre. He claimed they were innocent pictures as they travelled around Manchester. But retired Det Ch Insp Allan Donoghue described the images as \"hostile reconnaissance.\" He said: \"That for me was the most alarming thing. To see each entrance of the Arndale Centre being photographed... that was clearly a means by which they would brief the would-be attackers as to what they would see as they made their approaches.\" Police think the first target would have been the Arndale Centre, which had been rebuilt following the IRA bomb attack on Manchester in 1996. The terrorists would have walked in carrying bombs made out of fizzy drink bottles in rucksacks or specially modified T-shirts. After the first wave of explosions, there would have been a second attack with more suicide bombers waiting in St Anne's Square for the rush of shoppers trying to escape. The target was chosen by al-Qaeda leaders because of the financial impact as well as the huge number of potential victims. According to Dr David Lowe, a retired special branch officer who now teaches law at John Moores University in Liverpool, it would have been a devastating attack. He said: \"It would have potentially been bigger than the 77 attack in London. It would have sent shockwaves around the world. And it would have shown that not just capital cities are targets.\" The scale of the potential disaster is something the man who led the police investigation is well aware of.

{"original_text": "But many of the people using the health service in England or Northern Ireland on Monday morning may not have noticed a huge difference. Why? Walkouts in the NHS are quite different from other sectors. When tube drivers, council staff or teachers strike the aim is to cause disruption. It is the first rule of industrial action: make your contribution count. However, the terms of engagement are somewhat different when NHS workers take part. While unions members want to make a point, they commit to not harming urgent and emergency services. Ahead of this week's action local union officials held talks with managers to plan services - as they did before the walkout on 17 October. It means there are likely to have been many staff in work who supported the strike but have agreed to keep working. Midwives are a classic example of this. The Royal College of Midwives has promised to keep maternity units running and so well over half of their members are believed to have worked. And even where staff have walked out, there appears to have been a willingness to leave the picket lines when there has been a need. In a word, pay. Ministers in England and Northern Ireland have awarded NHS staff a 1 increase, but only for those without automatic progression-in-the-job rises. These, designed to reward professional development, are given to about half of staff and are worth 3 a year on average. What is more, the offer is \"non-consolidated,\" which means it is taken away at the end of the year, meaning their pay packet returns back to the 2013-14 level, and does not count towards staff pensions. An independent pay review board had said the 1 increase should be across the board and paid in full as normal. Next year it has been suggested those not getting a progression-in-the job rise get 2, but again it should be non-consolidated. But in Scotland a 1 pay rise was given to everyone and in Wales a deal was reached last week after ministers agreed to pay 1 next year, while giving extra help to the lowest paid this year. It means the disruption during both strikes seems to have been limited to areas such as outpatient appointments and community clinics. And it is why unions are able to claim strong support for the walkout, while NHS England releases figures suggesting only about 12,500 staff - about one in 35 - did not turn up for work. But with the strike now ended, attention turns to what happens next. The simple answer is a period of work-to-rule. Members from the nine unions involved in the walkout are expected to take steps such as refusing to do unpaid overtime and insisting on taking their breaks. They may be joined by another two unions. However, as far as an end to this dispute, a solution seems some way off. As the walkout was coming to an end, unions were already telling me they would be sitting down to discuss future action. There was a meeting between the strike in October and this one, but it is thought little progress was made with the government maintaining giving a 1 pay rise on top of the progression-in-the-job pay rises was simply not affordable. Unions have been told that they are free to come up with another solution, but that there is no more money for pay. That means making some kind of compromise on the progression-in-the-job element. These can be extremely lucrative - for senior nurses and midwives they are worth??10,000 - so understandably staff are unwilling to give them up. But to understand the cause of this dispute you really need to go back to 2009. That was the year the then NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson set the health service an ambitious savings target. The NHS was told to save??20bn by 2014 - later pushed back to 2015. Sir David was adamant, though, it could not simply be achieved through cuts, but rather it had to come from efficiency savings. It works out as a productivity gain of between 4 and 5 a year - something the health service had never done before. Unsurprisingly, it has turned out to be just as difficult as expected. A report by MPs earlier this year showed significant inroads had been made, but the majority of these had not come from efficiency savings. Instead, the NHS had relied on \"quick fixes\" - namely pay restraint. Over the last four years there have been two years of freezes and two of small rises. That has had a significant impact on the pockets of health workers. Figures from Unison suggest health worker pay has fallen by 10 during this period once inflation is taken into account. But it is easy to understand - in simple money terms at least - why ministers have adopted such an approach. About 40 of the budget is spent on pay and with the NHS facing a??30bn hole in its finances by 2020, the government is under pressure to make resources stretch as far as they can. That said, ministers know they face a tricky dilemma. Governments tend to avoid getting into disputes with health workers - public opinion normally sides with them - and so a lengthy period of industrial action ahead of an election will be something ministers will be keen to avoid.

{"original_text": "She's just been in the studio with Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw, trying to make him giggle while he goes about some serious radio presenting business; and she's daydreaming about her favourite UK delicacy - a sandwich from Pret. When she discovers she's in the same building as the BBC newsroom, the star politely asks for a guided tour. \"I never get to do stuff like this,\" marvels the singer, as she walks wide-eyed past the studios and satellite feeds. In this context, Del Rey is oddly anonymous. Jane Hill, who is preparing to read the lunchtime news on BBC One, doesn't even look up when the superstar squeezes past her desk. It's a rare luxury for someone who's followed by paparazzi and the all-seeing cameras of TMZ when she's at home in California. She addresses the lack of privacy on her new album, Lust For Life, where a song called 13 Beaches finds Del Rey searching for a spot \"past Ventura and lenses plenty\" where she can enjoy a romantic moment in seclusion. When we sit down to chat, she reveals those same concerns stopped her attending the women's marches in Los Angeles, earlier this year. \"I drove my sister and her girlfriends to the marches,\" she says. \"I thought about [joining in] but I felt, like, not really sure how it would go. \"I didn't really want to be a distraction to that group of 10 girls who were going. I wanted them to think about the actual march and not about me standing right next to them.\" But the star is making her contribution in other ways. A new song, God Bless America And All The Beautiful Women In It, is an ode to womankind may you stand proud and strong; while Coachella - Woodstock In My Mind, mines the contradictions of dancing at a festival \"whilst watching tensions with North Korea mount.\" It's a new dimension for Del Rey's lyrics - which have traditionally concerned themselves with \"looking for love in all the wrong places.\" \"I kind of got jolted into the real world again,\" she says. \"Just being in California, it's such a liberal state, I was bombarded with the news every day. So my studio became like a think tank - during the elections it was a constant conversation with my producer and engineers and assistant engineers. \"And then obviously during Coachella, that news broke about North Korea and pointing missiles at each other. That was a bit of a rude awakening.\" Del Rey's work rate is astonishing. Lust For Life is her fifth album in six years - and it bursts at the seams, with 16 tracks all co-written with her longtime producer Rick Nowels. They record everything at his studio in Santa Monica, just blocks away from the beach, so it \"never feels like work,\" she says. \"Just walking in every day and having a coffee together and taking a walk, and then we start. \"So it doesn't ever feel like I'm pumping them [the songs] out. Although it's definitely a blessing that I've been able to put out so much music.\" On Lust For Life, the singer has opened up musically, as well as lyrically. The title track is a pulse-raising duet with The Weeknd, while Summer Bummer almost self-destructs, dissolving into digital noise and blacked-out beats, with Lana's vocals barely holding the song together. She's also welcomed collaborators into her world for the first time - absorbing them into her aesthetic, rather than capitalising on chart trends. \"It was really fun!\" she says of working with AAP Rocky and The Weeknd. \"I wanted those guys to add a little fire, a little energy to the record.\" More daunting was inviting rock legend Stevie Nicks to duet on Beautiful People, Beautiful Problems. \"I was definitely nervous,\" says Del Rey of the recording session. \"She got off the plane at 10:30, so she didn't get to the studio until midnight - and she just breezed in, black on black, gold everywhere. She was kind of a vision. \"When she started singing, she told me she wanted to hear me sing something, too. And then I really freaked out! \"I said to her over the mic,'I just sound so quiet compared to you.' And she was like,'That's ok, you can be my little echo!' \"I thought that was so cool. I'm not as loud as her. My voice isn't as low as hers. But she loves it for what it is. \"That, as it was happening, was a career-defining moment for me.\" Other songs on the album had a more troubled gestation. Del Rey says the closing track, Get Free, originally had a different title, and much more personal lyrics. \"That song started out really revealing,\" she says. \"I wanted to summarise my whole experience over the last six years; and then I realised, I don't want to reveal everything.\" Once the initial version was \"out of my system,\" she says, the recording was \"deleted completely then started from scratch.\" The lyrics became more vague and more hopeful; and the re-recorded version ends with Del Rey referencing Neil Young: \"I want to move out of the black, into the blue.\" \"I think it would have been hard for me to do interviews if I'd said a couple of particular things that I was thinking of,\" she says of the original. \"Kind of the way Ultraviolence did. It was harder to promote that record.\" She's referring to the title track of her second album, which depicted Del Rey in a destructive, abusive relationship. Del Rey has previously hinted the song refers to her association with an \"underground sect\" in New York, which was controlled by a charismatic guru. In concert, she has recently stopped singing the song's key line, \"he hit me and it felt like a kiss.\" \"I don't feel comfortable with that lyric any more,\" she says now. \"Whatever my concept of affection was at the time, it does not serve me any more. Obviously. Hopefully.\" On Lust For Life she seems happier, more outward-looking than before. On stage, she's more confident, too. Launching the album at a one-off gig in London, she's forced to abandon her performance of the opening track, Love. Earlier in her career, she might have frozen. Now, she just sings it a capella, with the crowd stepping in as her own personal choir. \"I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I think my keyboard player was playing the wrong chords,\" she explains. \"I was leaning in to him and saying,'That's not it, that's not it' and he was like,'That is it, trust me'. \"I listened for 10 seconds and I was like,'Damn, I definitely can't get it'. I couldn't get it in rehearsal, either. So I just told him to stop. I feel bad - I was kind of abrasive. \"But that song is at the heart of the record and I thought it'd be weird if I didn't do it. So, luckily the people who were at the show knew the words and they sang along with me.\" She listens with glee to a recording of the song - explaining how, because she wears in-ear headphones, she hadn't realised how loud the crowd had been. \"I'm so glad,\" she says. \"Being in the audience, did you feel that, too?\" I tell her it was like being in church. \"Oh, stop!\" she beams, and bursts into laughter.

{"original_text": "India's greatest leader had moved to a village called Segaon two years earlier. He had renamed it Sevagram or a village of service. He built an ashram, a commune which was home to \"many a fateful decision which affected the destiny of India.\" Gandhi had moved in with his wife, Kasturba, and some followers. There was also a steady stream of guests. Kanu Gandhi, a callow young man in his 20s and a grand nephew of the Mahatma, was also there. Armed with a Rolleiflex camera, he was taking pictures of the leader. He had wanted to become a doctor, but his parents had goaded him to join Gandhi's personal staff doing clerical work, looking after accounts and writing letters at the ashram. Kanu Gandhi had developed an interest in photography, but Gandhi had told him there was no money to buy him a camera. The nephew did not relent. Finally, Gandhi asked businessman Ghanshyam Das Birla to gift 100 rupees (1.49; PS1.00) to Kanu so that he could buy the camera and a roll of film. But the leader imposed three conditions on the photographer: he forbade him from using flash and asking him to pose; and made it clear that the ashram would not pay for his photography. Kanu made do with a stipend from a Gandhi acolyte who liked his work. He also began selling his pictures to newspapers. Over the years and until Gandhi's assassination in 1948, Kanu Gandhi shot some 2,000 pictures of the greatest leader of the Indian Independence movement. For decades, his pictures remained in obscurity, once surfacing with a German researcher who began compiling and selling them. Now, 92 of those rare pictures of Gandhi during the last decade of his life have been published in an exquisitely produced cloth-bound monograph by the Delhi-based Nazar Foundation, a non-profit trust founded by two of India's most well-known photographers Prashant Panjiar and Dinesh Khanna. This is possibly my most favourite image from the book. Here Gandhi is standing on a weighing scale at the Birla House in Bombay (what is now Mumbai) in 1945. For a man who undertook more than a dozen fasts during the freedom movement as a part of his non-violent protests - to bring peace, demand Muslim rights or to shame rioting mobs - the picture is telling. \"This is a picture of a man keeping an eye on his weight, testing himself all the time. It tells you a lot about the man,\" says leading photographer Sanjeev Saith who went through more than 1,000 images and helped curate the monograph. Here, Gandhi is seen in front of his office hut at Sevagram ashram in 1940. A pillow covers his head as protection against the severe heat. It is, at once, an intimate and remote image. Which is one of the reasons, many say, that made Kanu Gandhi's pictures of the Mahatma so special. \"Although he had incredible access to the icon, we are always struck at the way Kanu, perhaps because he was in awe of Gandhi always kept a respectful distance, and yet managed to convey a sense of intimacy and proximity,\" says Panjiar. \"And because he kept a certain distance, Kanu intuitively found a more modern language of photography than what was prevalent in those times in India, framing many of his images with an interesting and unconventional use of the foreground, breaking many of the accepted rules of composition.\" Kanu Gandhi travelled far and wide with the leader. Here's his image of a van carrying Gandhi being pushed by Pathans and Congress workers over some rough terrain in the North West Frontier Provinces in October 1938. This is a picture of Gandhi, and his wife Kasturba, in Abottabad in November, 1938. Kanu Gandhi's first-ever book of photographs chronicles the leader's political and personal journey in his last decade in vivid detail. There are pictures of Gandhi in his many moods - brooding, joyous, pensive, grieving - and with his supporters. Here Gandhi is being massaged by a relative and his elder sister Raliatbehn during a three-day fast in Gujarat's Rajkot city in March 1939. \"These images may be old, but they are not old-fashioned. They are not straightforward, beautifully shot and carefully framed, neat pictures which were popular then,\" says Panjiar. \"It possibly helped that Kanu was not a trained photographer because many of his images would have been rejected by his contemporaries on account of being blurred, slightly out of focus or double exposed. But these find pride of place, lovingly pasted by own hands in albums.\" Gandhi and his wife Kasturba are seen here at a wedding of a Christian man and an untouchable woman in Sevagram ashram, 1940. Sanjeev Saith says the picture of a dying Kasturba Gandhi lying on a bed at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune in 1944 a few months before her death counts among his favourites. A broken shaft of light is streaming in through a window behind her. \"Here is this austere woman lying regally on this stately bed, she is about to die. This picture just shakes me up,\" he says. And then there is this historic 1938 picture of Gandhi in a convivial mood with freedom hero and radical nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose. In the background, Kasturba Gandhi is drawing her sari, and looking into the distance. This was the high noon of Bose's political life: he had been elected as president of the Congress party. Gandhi had overruled objections from independence hero Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who had objected to Bose's appointment. The two leaders had shared a complex relationship and fell out later over differences. \"This is an amazing picture,\" says Saith. \"It contains two of India's greatest heroes in one frame. Bose is young, cherubic, almost looking at Gandhi in admiration. Gandhi has his characteristic toothless grin. It is a nice, warm moment.\" Here's Gandhi and Nobel Prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore in Shantiniketan, West Bengal, in February 1940, a study of two great men in meditation. \"Look at the bottom of the picture. It is an accidental double exposure [a technique which combined two different images into a single image]. It's rather inventive. Kanu Gandhi knew it was a good picture, and he didn't throw away the negative,\" says Saith. There's a series of pictures of Gandhi collecting donations for a fund for the untouchables during a three-month long train journey that took him to Bengal, Assam and southern India in 1945-46. In some he's stretching his arm from a carriage for money; in others he's surrounded by people and collecting the money in a slender basket. \"He's an old man, but he looks agile. He's almost begging for alms, and he's serious about picking up every bit of money for a good cause. He understands money,\" says Saith. \"I am a bania and there is no limit to my greed,\" Gandhi once said, alluding to his Indian caste comprising mainly of moneylenders. Being the only person who was allowed to take Gandhi's photographs at any time, Kanu Gandhi was shooting every day. Sometimes Gandhi intervened: one such moment was when Kasturba, lay dying in his lap at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. The nephew, however, was allowed to shoot this image of the leader, draped in a shawl, looking at Kasturba after she passed away in February 1944. According to several accounts, Gandhi kept a vigil for hours, sitting by her side, praying. \"After sixty years of constant companionship,\" he said later that night. \"I cannot imagine life without her.\" Ironically, for a man who followed Gandhi like a shadow, Kanu Gandhi was away in Noakhali in east Bengal when his leader was killed in 1948. \"Gandhi's death had a profound effect on Kanu and his wife, Abha's life. For Kanu, photography was no longer as important as the need to convey his leader's message,\" says Panjiar. Kanu Gandhi died after a heart attack while on a pilgrimage in northern India in February 1986. Photographs by Kanu Gandhi Gita Mehta, heir of Abha and Kanu Gandhi.", "text_perturb": "India 's greatest leader had moved to a settlement called Segaon two years earlier. He had rename it Sevagram or a village of service. He built an ashram , a commune which be home to `` many a fateful decision which affected the destiny of India. `` Gandhi had go in with his wife , Kasturba , and some followers. There was also a unwavering stream of guests. Kanu Gandhi , a unfledged young man in his 20s and a grand nephew of the Mahatma , was also there. Armed with a Rolleiflex camera , he was taking pictures of the loss leader. He had wanted to become a doctor , but his parent had goaded him to join Gandhi 's personal staff doing clerical work , looking after accounts and writing letters at the ashram. Kanu Gandhi had developed an interest in photography , but Gandhi had told him there was no money to buy him a tv camera. The nephew did non relent. Finally , Gandhi asked businessman Ghanshyam Das Birla to gift 100 nepalese rupee ( 1. 49 ; PS1. 00 ) to Kanu so that he could buy the tv camera and a roll of film. But the leader imposed three conditions on the photographer : he forbade him from using newsbreak and asking him to pose ; and made it clear that the ashram would not pay for his photography. Kanu made fare with a stipend from a Gandhi acolyte who liked his work. He also began selling his pictures to newspaper publisher. Over the years and until mahatma gandhi 's assassination in 1948 , Kanu mahatma gandhi shot some 2,000 pictures of the greatest leader of the Indian Independence movement. For decades , his pictures stay in obscurity , once surfacing with a German researcher who began compiling and selling them. Now , 92 of those rare pictures of Gandhi during the last decennary of his life have been published in an exquisitely produced cloth-bound monograph by the Delhi-based Nazar Foundation , a non-profit trust founded by two of India 's most well-known photographers Prashant Panjiar and Dinesh Khanna. This is perhaps my most favourite image from the book. Here Gandhi is standing on a weighing plate at the Birla House in Bombay ( what is now Mumbai ) in 1945. For a man who undertook more than a dozen fasts during the freedom movement as a part of his non-violent protests - to bring peace , demand Muslim rights or to shame rioting mobs - the image is telling. `` This is a picture of a man hold an eye on his weight , testing himself all the time. It tells you a raft about the man , '' says leading photographer Sanjeev Saith who went through more than 1,000 images and helped curate the monograph. Here , Gandhi is seen in front of his authority hut at Sevagram ashram in 1940. A pillow covers his head as protection against the severe heating system. It is , at once , an confidant and remote image.

Shane Bissett , director of commemorative coin and bullion at the royal stag Mint , said : `` We felt there could be no more fitting design to mark the first birthday of our future king than the royal arms - the arms of the monarch - minted in honour of the future heir to the throne. `` The choice of a silver coin is significant too , as the precious metal is closely assort with newborn babies. . . `` Crossing the palm of a newborn baby with silver is a way to wish them wealth and good wellness throughout their life , whilst the PS5 coin is a favourite for royal celebrations. `` The coins leave be a limited mintage of 7,500 and leave cost PS80 each from the Royal Mint.

{"original_text": "One of the first out of the blocks is a touring production of All My Sons by black-led theatre company Talawa. The story centres on all-American couple Joe and Kate Keller, whose son is missing after World War Two. Its director Michael Buffong tells arts correspondent Tim Masters what makes the play a 20th Century classic. What does it mean to you to be taking All My Sons on the road in Miller's centenary year? The fact that it's a centenary year shines an even brighter spotlight on what is an amazing piece of work and an amazing writer. We originally performed this in 2013 and I'd love to say I planned the tour for the centenary, but the truth of it is that it's a coincidence. What makes All My Sons an American classic? The themes are so universal. On one level it's about chasing the dream and the cost of trying to live it. The themes that come out of the play are issues of loyalty and trust and betrayal, and secrets within families and how people collude and how ultimately everything can come falling down. The themes are so universal - what would you do for your family? Joe Keller thinks anything is forgivable because it's been done for his family but he doesn't have a wider social responsibility. That's his downfall. The 2013 production earned five star reviews - does that add pressure to taking it out two years later? I haven't thought about it. If I did I might not sleep too well. I guess it might add a bit of pressure. I read reviews, you can't help it. One has to be able to take them - the good and the bad. Given that it was such a hit, how much are you tweaking this time round? Like with any fantastic play once you get to revisit it you realise its depth - we are finding so many new things. Half the cast are different so it can't be the same because they bring new elements. It just goes to show the quality of the text: there's always more to unearth. Does having a black cast give the play a new perspective? It certainly gives it a nuance. If you think of a black family trying to achieve the American dream suddenly the stakes become higher still because of black history in the US. But it essentially remains the same story: it's a family drama, and this family is an all-American family. You took over Talawa in 2012 - are there still things you want to achieve? I'm just at the beginning. The past three years have been great and we are starting to achieve some of things we set out to do. It's great that we get do do All My Sons, and we get to work with the companies like the National Theatre as we did last year with Moon on a Rainbow Shawl. We've got a writers' programme working with the Bush and Soho Theatres and the BBC, and we have a space we are desperate to develop into a 100-seat venue. We are looking for funding to do that. What's the latest on workshops you've had with Lenny Henry on a play about the American comedian Richard Pryor? We are still in the workshopping process. It's in development. I hope it will come to the stage. We are both keen to see it happen. All My Sons, with a cast led by Ray Shell and Dona Croll, has opened at Ipswich's New Wolsey Theatre, and tours until 25 April.

{"original_text": "He is the latest casualty of the Trump White House, and takes the record for the shortest term in a top job: he was fired 10 days after being announced as communications director. But of course, there is a long line of people behind him who have been fired or eased out of their jobs by President Trump. Here's a run-down of what they did, and why they left, starting with \"The Mooch.\" The brash, Wall Street big wig has known President Trump for years, and charismatically defended him in TV interviews. Although he didn't last long in the job, he made big headlines. He appeared to accuse Chief of Staff Reince Priebus of being responsible for White House leaks in a tweet (later deleted) that also appeared to threaten him. Mr Scaramucci then attacked Mr Priebus and President Trump's senior adviser Steve Bannon in an expletive-filled rant on the phone with a reporter from the New Yorker magazine. Why was he sacked? Although he had boasted of reporting directly to the president, Mr Scaramucci's ill-discipline may have cost him any post alongside President Trump's new chief of staff - retired, four-star General John Kelly. Mr Scaramucci's departure was announced hours after Mr Kelly was sworn-in to replace Mr Priebus. The White House said Mr Trump believed comments Mr Scaramucci had made were \"inappropriate.\" Time in post? Ten days. (Though his official start date was 15 August - so possibly minus-15 days.) The former Republican National Committee chairman was one of few Washington veterans given a top role in the Trump White House but was unable to assert his authority. He grappled with competing powers in an administration where Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, play key roles. Mr Scaramucci was hired despite Mr Priebus's disagreement and insulted him seemingly without reproach from the president. Why was he sacked? President Trump lost confidence in him and clearly wanted a shake-up in the White House, opting for a general to replace the Republican Party operative, who was seen as weak. The announcement also came as the Republicans failed in their efforts to repeal Obamacare in the Senate. Time in post? Six months. Mr Spicer famously kicked off his tenure as White House press secretary by defending a seemingly indefensible claim about the crowd size at President Trump's inauguration. Over the course of his time behind the podium, he became - unusually for a press secretary - a household name, and was parodied on Saturday Night Live. Why did he leave? Unlike most others on this list, Mr Spicer appears to have left on seemingly good terms with the president. He stepped down after Mr Scaramucci was appointed to a role he had partially filled, saying he did not want there to be \"too many cooks in the kitchen.\" Sarah Huckabee Sanders had also taken over many of Mr Spicer's press briefings. The New York Times reported that Mr Spicer had \"vehemently\" disagreed with the appointment of Mr Scaramucci, which he believed to be a \"major mistake.\" Time in post? Six months. Mr Comey played a dramatic and controversial part in the closing stages of the election when he announced, a week before the vote, that the FBI had reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. He was criticised first by Democrats for the timing and alleged indiscretion of the announcement, then by Republicans when he said a week later that no charges would be brought. But Mr Trump praised the FBI director heavily, saying it \"took a lot of guts\" to make his announcement and that he had \"brought back his reputation.\" He blew Mr Comey a kiss at the White House. The president grew less appreciative of him as the FBI director led an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Why was he sacked? The Trump administration first claimed Mr Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation rendered him no longer able to credibly lead the bureau and that Mr Trump had acted on the deputy attorney general's recommendation. However Mr Trump soon contradicted this, calling him a \"showboat\" in a TV interview and saying he was thinking if the \"Russia thing\" when he made the decision to sack him. Later it emerged that he allegedly told Russian officials that the dismissal had taken \"great pressure\" off him. Special counsel Robert Mueller is reported to be investigating whether obstruction of justice occurred. Time in post? Three years, eight months. Less than four months under Mr Trump. Technically, Michael Flynn resigned, but he was asked to do so by the president. His departure followed weeks of deepening scandal in which it emerged that he had misled White House officials, including the vice-president, over his contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Mr Flynn is said to have discussed US sanctions against Russia with Mr Kislyak before Mr Trump took office. Mr Trump was briefed on the possibility that Mr Flynn was open to blackmail, because Moscow knew he was lying, but 18 days elapsed before the president sacked him, raising questions about exactly what the president knew and when. Why was he sacked? It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy, and once it was established that Mr Flynn had lied about his contact with Mr Kislyak there was no question that he had to go. The question with this sacking was, why did it take so long? White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the president needed the time to investigate Mr Flynn and establish his guilt, but the scandal prompted fierce speculation over what the president knew of Mr Flynn's contacts with Mr Kislyak. Time in post? 23 days. The president fired Sally Yates after she questioned the legality of Mr Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Ms Yates, who was appointed by Barack Obama, believed it discriminated unconstitutionally against Muslims, and ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce the president's executive order. Within hours, she was fired. Why was she sacked? A White House statement said Ms Yates had \"betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States.\" It also described her as \"weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.\" But it was also Ms Yates who informed White House counsel that Michael Flynn had misled the vice-president about his contacts with Ambassador Kislyak and presented a risk of Russian blackmail as a result. The president's sacking of an Obama-era holdover who had openly defied him was certainly less controversial than the Comey dismissal, but it drew heavy criticism from Democrats, who said Ms Yates had done her job in standing up to the travel ban. Time in post? 10 days. It is not uncommon for prosecutors appointed by the previous administration to be replaced as the White House changes hands, but the widely-respected Preet Bharara had been told specifically by the Trump administration that he would be kept on. Mr Bharara had built a reputation as the \"Sheriff of Wall Street\" after a number of aggressive prosecutions of traders. At the time of his sacking, he was overseeing several high-profile cases, including an investigation into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's campaign finances and allegations of sexual harassment at Trump favourite Fox News. Why was he sacked? Mr Bharara was one of 46 prosecutors asked to resign by the Trump administration, which contended that it was part of a simple changing of the guard. But there was speculation among Democrats and others that Mr Bahara's jurisdiction, which included Trump Tower, may have concerned the president. A few days before he was sacked, three ethics groups called on Mr Bharara in an open letter to investigate whether Trump companies in his jurisdiction had received foreign payments. Meanwhile, a ProPublica investigation revealed that Mr Bharara was overseeing an investigation into stock trades by Mr Trump's incoming health secretary Tom Price. Three Democratic senators wrote to attorney general Jeff Sessions asking him to investigate the Bharara sacking. Time in post? Seven years, seven months. Less than two under Mr Trump. Paul Manafort, a long-time Republican political operative, was supposed to marshal some of the chaos around Mr Trump but ended up falling prey to it. He was sacked after five months with Mr Trump's campaign, three of those as campaign chair. Why was he sacked? The Trump campaign didn't give a reason for Mr Manafort's departure, issuing only a boilerplate statement wishing him well. But a wave of reports in the week before the announcement alleged that Mr Manafort had received secret cash payments from a pro-Russian political party for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and the US. While Mr Manafort was running the campaign, the Republican Party changed the language in its manifesto regarding the conflict in Ukraine, removing anti-Russian sentiment, allegedly at the behest of two Trump campaign representatives.

{"original_text": "Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly revenue of 80,000 (PS62,000). The firearms trade has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks. The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access, in order for users to remain anonymous. While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations, it had the potential to become the platform of choice for \"lone-wolf\" terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition, the report said. Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation Europe, working with Manchester University, found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition, explosives, or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets. Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting, which left nine people dead, used weapons purchased on the dark net. Lead author of the research, Giacomo Persi Paoli, said: \"Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real. \"The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists, who can make virtually anonymous purchases, but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect.\" Guns account for less than 1 of items sold on the platform, with its main trade being in narcotics.

The study involved collecting data from 12 dark net marketplaces during a week in September 2016. Most of those selling guns were based in the US, but Europe was the most popular destination for the weapons they sold. Judith Aldridge, co-investigator on the study, said: \"In very simple terms, anyone can connect to the dark web and within minutes have access to a variety of vendors offering their products, which are most often illegal. \"The dark web enables illegal trade at a global level, removing some of the geographical barriers between vendors and buyers, while increasing the personal safety of both buyers and sellers through a series of anonymising features that obscure their identities.\"", "text_perturb": "Those selling the illicit arm often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers , the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly gross of 80,000 ( PS62,000 ). The firearms barter has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks. The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access , in order for user to remain anonymous. While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations , it had the potential to suit the platform of choice for `` lone-wolf '' terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition , the report said. Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation eec , working with Manchester University , found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition , explosives , or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets. Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting , which left nine people all in , used weapons purchased on the dark net. Lead author of the inquiry , Giacomo Persi Paoli , said : `` Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real. `` The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists , who can make virtually anonymous purchase , but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect. `` Guns account for less than 1 of items sold on the chopine , with its main trade being in narcotics. Nevertheless , the volume being trade `` can be considered sufficiently high to be a cause of concern for policy makers and law enforcement agencies , '' said the report.

This was a hugely significant fixture for the visitors too, Louis van Gaal and his players arriving with their fate in their own hands but little margin for error. They knew victory here, amid a heady mix of nostalgia and fierce hostility, would leave them needing only to beat Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Sunday to secure Champions League football. Instead, a 3-2 loss leaves them still needing that win against the Cherries - but now requiring that neighbours Manchester City lose at Swansea. Media playback is not supported on this device As a fleet of London taxis brought a succession of West Ham greats on to the Boleyn Ground turf for the big finish to the farewell party, several cynics suggested one cab was on order to ferry Van Gaal away from Manchester United. It has been obvious since Christmas that there has been no great appetite inside Old Trafford to replace Van Gaal - if United were certain he was not the man for the job, former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho could have already been occupying his office or at least officially lined up. Even in the hours before this loss at West Ham, Van Gaal's position appeared to be gaining strength with the supposed loss of 18-year-old transfer target Renato Sanches to Bayern Munich in a PS27.6m deal. It was later suggested United had not missed out but that Van Gaal had actually vetoed the deal - and why would the club let him do that if he was not going to be in charge next season? The fact that Sanches' agent is Jorge Mendes, who would love to see his client Mourinho installed at Old Trafford, only added to the perceived political intrigue. Media playback is not supported on this device One way Van Gaal could have strengthened his position even further would have been a win at West Ham that would have made United firm favourites to beat City to fourth place in the Premier League, with the potential bonus of an FA Cup final victory over Crystal Palace in May. Indeed, so buoyed was Van Gaal by the sudden upturn in his position that he was even able to point out to the media that they were finally posing tactical questions before a game rather than asking about his possible sacking. And for four tantalising second-half minutes it all seemed on for Van Gaal. Antony Martial's brilliance had turned the game, undeservedly on its balance, in United's favour with two goals. At 2-1 up, they were 14 minutes from a win that could have offered the opportunity to put a different spin on their season. It was not to be. Old vulnerabilities quickly returned and saw United beaten by two headed goals from Michail Antonio and Winston Reid - leaving Van Gaal back on the rack. The players dragged their manager out of a hole then threw him back in again. The intention may still be to keep him next season but that decision would have been made a lot easier and more palatable with victory. Now it all goes on the line again on Sunday - but with Manchester City at the controls. The equation is simple. Manchester United must beat Bournemouth and hope Manchester City lose at Swansea - and therein lies that sliver of hope for the 64-year-old Dutch coach. City have been so unreliable, unpredictable and uninspired at times this season that you would not risk too much on the certainty of Manuel Pellegrini's side getting the job done. Of course City will be favourites and only need a point - but they are not a team to be trusted, as seen in their heavy defeat at Southampton and disappointing draw at home to Arsenal in their last two Premier League games. And after beating Liverpool 3-1 and, more impressively, thrashing West Ham 4-1 at Upton Park on Saturday, Swansea are also running into the sort of relaxed good form that makes them dangerous opponents. Confidence has been renewed to such an extent that head coach Francesco Guidolin is expected to be confirmed on a new contract after a Swansea board meeting on Wednesday. City can be fragile and United will hope that vulnerability haunts them one last time. And then all it needs is for United to beat Bournemouth - but United cannot be trusted either. Manchester United's players may have been affected by an arduous coach journey that ended in such disgraceful scenes outside Upton Park - and West Ham co-owner David Sullivan's dismissive response that the visitors should simply have arrived earlier did no credit to him or his club on this landmark night. The kick-off was delayed by 45 minutes but there was still no excuse for a tepid Manchester United first half that lacked urgency, organisation and anything that would be reasonably expected with stakes so high. They were lucky to only trail to Diafra Sakho's early goal, their defence going missing in its entirety shortly afterwards when Andy Carroll raced clear only to shoot straight at David de Gea. It was as if Van Gaal had not impressed upon his players that a door to the Champions League that had looked shut for so long was suddenly ajar. Instead it looked like meaningless, end-of-season stuff. The superb Martial offered brief hope, the normally passive Van Gaal leaping from his seat to punch the air - but the joy did not last long as the visitors' vulnerability in defence was exposed. They simply could not cope with West Ham's pressure. For long spells this was a performance that made you question how such an ordinary side could even be in contention for a top-four place. They were that poor. True, they missed the aerial strength of suspended Marouane Fellaini, who operated with such success to not only combat the likes of Carroll but also score when Manchester United won 2-1 at Upton Park in the FA Cup quarter-final replay. In the final reckoning, however, this defeat was deserved after a display that produced much of the evidence that has left so many United fans questioning Van Gaal's future. Van Gaal will still believe his side can reach the Champions League but the odds are against them now so he may well end up looking to the FA Cup for success. If United win he will undoubtedly paint this as progress - and he will have a point as it would be the club's first major trophy since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. It may not be enough, however, to suggest Van Gaal is pointing United in the right direction, despite his willingness to play youth with the emergence of 18-year-old Marcus Rashford and the signing of 20-year-old Antony Martial - who increasingly looks like a bargain at PS36m from Monaco.

{"original_text": "England's win over South Africa on Sunday secured the Twenty20 series. The game was officially sold out, as were England's two ICC Champions Trophy matches at the SSE Swalec Stadium. The near-15,000 crowd comes as counties bid for the next round of five years' worth of international games. \"To have three full houses over 19 days for England matches is something we've very proud of,\" said Morris. Cardiff hosted England's win over New Zealand and semi-final defeat to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy, along with Sri Lanka versus Pakistan and the less well-attended Bangladesh v New Zealand match. Around 3,000 seats were not occupied for the England v New Zealand match because of poor weather forecasts, while cancelled trains are believed to have contributed to some empty seats for the T20 on Sunday.

{"original_text": "Sir Alex Ferguson's Premier League champions responded in spectacular fashion to Manchester City's outstanding 5-1 win at Spurs by returning to the top of the table with a result that represented Arsenal's worst defeat since 1896. Wenger sent out a makeshift side depleted by injuries and suspensions - but even this cannot excuse the manner in which they were outclassed in all parts of the pitch and swept aside with such ease by United. Wayne Rooney was United's inspiration with the sixth hat-trick of his Old Trafford career, but Ashley Young also made his mark with two stunning goals. Danny Welbeck, Nani and Park Ji-sung were the other scorers. Media playback is not supported on this device Theo Walcott reduced United's three-goal advantage on the stroke of half-time but Robin van Persie's strike late in the second half-represented no measure of consolation for a dispirited, broken Arsenal. United keeper David de Gea distinguished himself with a fine penalty save from Van Persie moments after Welbeck had opened the scoring - and in a game of almost unrelenting misery for Arsenal, teenager Carl Jenkinson ensured they have failed to end a game with 11 players in any of their league games this season when he was sent off. Old Trafford was understandably exultant at the conclusion of such a carnival performance but Wenger now faces defining days of his Arsenal reign before the transfer window closes on Wednesday. For Wenger it was a performance, or lack of one, that proved the folly of his summer of transfer inaction Read more of the blog This result underscores the gulf that has opened up between United and Arsenal and Wenger will now seek to address the weaknesses in his squad and replace the departed Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri. Ferguson's faith in the team that won so convincingly against Tottenham was rewarded with another thrilling attack-minded performance. Arsenal's uncertainty was partly explained by the unfamiliar make-up of their team, but the flaws were swiftly exposed by the manner in which United took the lead. Anderson's lofted pass was inventive but Arsenal's failure to react was ominous for what lay ahead, allowing Welbeck to head past Wojciech Szczesny. Van Persie then squandered an instant opportunity to equalise after referee Howard Webb awarded a penalty when Walcott tangled with Jonny Evans in the area. De Gea has had a mixed start to his Old Trafford career but he was engulfed by his team-mates as he dived to his right to make a fine save. And United ensured Arsenal were punished heavily as Young added the second after 28 minutes. Young found space just outside the area and curled a perfect finish high beyond Szczesny's grasp at the Stretford End. Welbeck's game was cut short by a hamstring injury - but there was no respite for Arsenal as Rooney worked a free-kick routine with Young to send a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner as the interval approached. Walcott halted some of United's momentum when he took advantage of slack marking to shoot beneath De Gea in first-half injury time. It made little difference amid the carnage of the second half as Arsenal were torn apart amid a torrent of goals, near misses and saves from the desperately exposed Szczesny. Arsenal survived until the 64th minute when they were undone by another piece of Rooney creation at a set-piece, again linking with Young before dispatching the finish past the motionless Arsenal keeper. It was the breaking point for Arsenal and they spent the remainder of game in a constant state of siege. Rooney was the creator for Nani with the pass that gave the Portuguese the opportunity to send a flamboyant chipped finish over Szczesny for United's fifth. Media playback is not supported on this device With the Gunners in disarray, Park marked his arrival as substitute by lashing home an unstoppable finish before Van Persie briefly interrupted the one-way flow towards Arsenal's goal by beating De Gea. It barely seemed possible for matters to get worse for Arsenal, but the agony increased when Jenkinson was sent off after receiving his second yellow card for fouling Javier Hernandez as he raced clear. Rooney completed his thrilling treble with a penalty eight minutes from time after Walcott fouled Patrice Evra. And United completed the scoring with their eighth in injury time, Young once again showing his eye for the spectacular with another curling shot. Wenger cut a despairing figure as he walked back to the dressing room at the final whistle after one of the darkest days of his career. Full Time The referee blows for the end of the match.

Wenger transmit out a makeshift side depleted by injuries and suspensions - but even this can not excuse the manner in which they were outclassed in all parts of the pitch and swept aside with such ease by United. Wayne Rooney was United 's inspiration with the sixth hat-trick of his Old Trafford career , but Ashley youth also made his mark with two stunning goals. Danny Welbeck , Nani and park Ji-sung were the other scorers. Media playback is not supported on this device Theo Walcott cut down United 's three-goal advantage on the stroke of half-time but Robin van Persie 's strike late in the second half-represented no measure of consolation for a dispirited , broken Arsenal. United keeper David de Gea distinguished himself with a fine penalty save from Van Persie moments after Welbeck had opened the scoring - and in a game of almost unrelenting misery for Arsenal , teenager Carl Jenkinson ensured they have failed to end a game with 11 players in any of their league games this time of year when he was sent off. old Trafford was understandably exultant at the conclusion of such a carnival performance but Wenger now faces defining days of his Arsenal reign before the transfer window closes on Wednesday.

De Gea has had a mixed start to his Old Trafford career but he was engulfed by his team-mates as he dived to his right to arrive at a fine save. And United ensured Arsenal were punished heavily as brigham young added the second after 28 minutes. Young rule space just outside the area and curled a perfect finish high beyond Szczesny 's grasp at the Stretford End. Welbeck 's game represent cut short by a hamstring injury - but there represent no respite for Arsenal as Rooney worked a free-kick routine with Young to send a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner as the interval approached. Walcott kibosh some of United 's momentum when he took advantage of slack marking to shoot beneath De Gea in first-half injury time. It made little difference amid the carnage of the second half as Arsenal make up torn apart amid a torrent of goals , near misses and saves from the desperately exposed Szczesny. Arsenal survived until the 64th minute when they were undone by another piece of Rooney creation at a set-piece , over again linking with Young before dispatching the finish past the motionless Arsenal keeper. It was the breaking point for Arsenal and they spent the remainder of game in a unvarying state of siege.

Rooney completed his thrilling treble with a penalty eight instant from time after Walcott fouled Patrice Evra.

{"original_text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi scrapped 1,000 (PS11.8) and 500 notes in a surprise move last week as part of a tax evasion and corruption crackdown. People have a limited time to exchange the notes for smaller denominations, but will have their fingers marked. The government wants to stop holders of \"black cash\" offloading their old rupee notes in small tranches. Authorities often use indelible ink to stop people from voting more than once in Indian elections. People were told they should deposit their high denomination notes in the banks, or could only exchange up to 4,500 rupees, (65; PS52) for smaller notes. But to clamp down on holders of unlawfully held or untaxed cash, depositors can only make such transactions once and so the banks are using the ink to prevent them from making multiple deposits. India scraps 1,000 rupee notes overnight Chaos at banks over India money ban Supporters say it is a handy way for the Indian government to tackle corruption. The finance ministry suspects \"unscrupulous\" people have been trying to get around the crackdown by sending proxies to exchange their banned rupee notes. The withdrawal of the big notes is aimed at'black money' and targets people who have been dodging taxes by holding stockpiles of cash. While the authorities say people will not be allowed another cash swap, critics are wondering what happens if the ink wears off? During elections, people have used chemicals to remove the ink from their fingers so that they can vote more than once. The government's ban on big bank notes first received widespread approval because less than 3 of Indians file tax returns.

Speaking in the European Parliament, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the plan was a \"handbrake turn\" by David Cameron. The prime minister has hailed a plan to allow the UK to limit the amount of tax credits paid to new EU migrants for up to four years as one of the key elements of a draft package of reforms to the UK's membership of the EU - the details of which he will set out to the UK Parliament later. He has said the emergency brake, which would take effect if it could be proven that high levels of migration were putting an extreme strain on the UK's benefits system, could be triggered almost immediately. But many Tory MPs have criticised the plan, saying it is a watered-down version of the total four-year ban the PM was hoping for and that new migrants would still receive \"graduated\" rates of in-work benefits over the four year period and the full amount after that. They are also unhappy that the brake would have to be approved by other EU nations and the UK could not apply it unilaterally.

It will apply in exceptional cases as all derogrations from the freedoms (of movement rules) should.\" Mr Juncker pointed out that the then Labour government had had the option to introduce transitional controls on migration when countries such as Poland and Hungary entered the EU in 2004 but, unlike Germany, decided against doing so. One of the most controversial decisions of Tony Blair's time in office, several former Labour ministers have since said it was a mistake and acknowledged the government hugely underestimated the number of people who would come to the UK.

When we beat Belgium in Cardiff in June, Coleman kept Hazard quiet by bringing in Jazz Richards at right wing-back and moving Chris Gunter infield to be the right-sided centre-half in our back three. Between them, they handled him really well down Belgium's left, but I don't see Chris doing the same this time because continuity has been a big part of why we have done so well in France, especially at the back where we have been unchanged in all four games. Media playback is not supported on this device I can see Chris sticking with the same team that started against Northern Ireland, but our right-sided defensive midfielder - either Joe Allen or Joe Ledley - will have to get across to help Gunter as soon as Hazard gets the ball, along with James Chester, the right-sided centre-half. Their job will be to stop Hazard from coming inside and to show him down the line instead. When that happens, Gunter will also try to stop the cross from coming in, but you have to be realistic - Hazard is so good, he is going to get some balls over. So all our midfield players will have to pick their runners up around the box, not just De Bruyne, and the most important thing will be to mark Lukaku tightly because he will be trying to get between our other two centre-halves when the cross comes in. Media playback is not supported on this device Saunders: When we clear those crosses, we have got to counter-attack like I know we can do, because while Hazard's attacking play is one of Belgium's strengths, it is also a weakness. Jan Vertonghen's injury means we do not know who will play as Belgium's left-back against Wales but, whoever it is, we will be able to isolate them because Hazard does not run back. Hungary did it effectively, and they do not have the same attacking threat as us. The mistake they made was leaving their wide players too far up the pitch and that allowed Hazard to hurt them more - he was on fire in that game and Belgium should have won by more than 4-0. After watching that game again on Wednesday, though, I now have a clearer picture of what Wales will have to do to win. There is no way we will be as open as Hungary were from the start because we have so many unselfish and disciplined players like Allen and Ledley who do a lot of running just to support our defenders and ensure we do not lose our shape. But, when we steal the ball back, we have to use it properly. That starts with the first header clear from one of those Hazard crosses. I would be telling Gareth Bale or Aaron Ramsey to drift over to Belgium's left where they will have space - and the aim should be to get the ball to them and build the attack from there. Media playback is not supported on this device Hartson: There is a decision to be made up front because Hal Robson-Kanu played in both games against Belgium in the qualifiers and did not let us down. Hal is very mobile and gives us a threat in behind their defence with his pace, and he can also carry the ball better than Sam Vokes can. Sam is a big centre-forward that you can hit the ball to, and he will keep hold of it. He has a similar role to the one I had up front for Wales - winning headers and winning fouls so the team can advance up the pitch. It depends which way Chris wants to go, but Sam has started the past two games and I don't think he has done an awful lot wrong. He will contain both of Belgium's centre-halves like he did against Russia and give them problems in the air and on the ground - you cannot get around him. Media playback is not supported on this device Sam missed a good chance against Northern Ireland but the next one he gets like that, he will put it away. I have worked with him and I know how good he is. I also think he will now be feeling like the Wales number nine, not a bit-part player, which is something else I can relate to. At first I was always behind Ian Rush, Mark Hughes and Dean Saunders, but when Hughes became manager he made me first choice and my confidence went through the roof. I took on the mantle of being the main striker and I think Sam is in that position now, as an important member of this team. Media playback is not supported on this device Hartson: Coleman has got pretty much every tactical and selection issue right at this tournament so far but we have to appreciate how good this Belgium team is and what an incredible victory this would be. For it to happen, we need to have total focus at the back and we will rely on our best two players again - Ramsey and Bale, who have been involved in every Wales goal at this tournament - if we are going to score. I am optimistic we can get through, but I would not say I was overly confident about it because watching Belgium the other night was frightening, even if it was only against Hungary. One big factor in our favour is that we are unbeaten in our past three meetings, including a win - so we do know how to get a result against them. Saunders: Belgium are favourites for a reason but we have a good record against them, even going back to when I was in the team. Wales have a winning formula and Bale is part of that.

{"original_text": "The review into 22 abuse cases in Northern Ireland criticised the authorities for not doing enough. The young people went missing a number of times over a 20-month period while being looked after in the care system. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it has recently made policy changes aimed at keeping children safe. In September 2013, the PSNI said it had begun a major investigation into the sexual exploitation of children and young people who had gone missing from care in Northern Ireland. Officers said they had identified 22 people, aged between 13 and 18, who may have been sexually exploited. The PSNI investigation was known was Operation Owl. Thursday's report, examining the PSNI response, has been published by the Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland. It said PSNI officers were effective in locating the teenagers and returning them to the care system. However, it found that they failed to properly examine the extent of the child sexual exploitation taking place and their attempts to find and stop the abusers was - in the words of the review - \"limited and inconsistent.\" While there is praise for the help offered by some staff from residential care homes, Stormont's Health Minister Simon Hamilton said that the report shows not enough support was given to protect the teenagers from harm or the risk of harm. He said the review had identified \"a significant gap\" in knowledge about perpetrators of child sexual exploitation. The head of the PSNI's Public Protection Branch, Det Ch Supt George Clarke said that following Operation Owl, the PSNI has \"implemented a number of changes in our approach to handling this issue to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep children and young people safe.\" \"Indeed, in April of this year, the PSNI formed the Public Protection Branch which is now responsible for policy and practice in relation to a number of areas including child sexual exploitation. \"The new structures enable us to work closely with our partner agencies in a much more cohesive way than before to ensure better protection and safeguarding for children and young people.\" The office said the PSNI has also revised its Missing Persons Protocol, a joint policy with the health and social care authorities. \"This protocol is designed to support effective collaborative safeguarding responses by the PSNI and social services in respect of children who run away or go missing from their homes or care placements and builds upon developments in our knowledge and experience,\" Mr Clarke added.
