You could build a paper mountain out of all the plans to give vocational education the same status as university degrees, There are several reasons why vocational education has struggled to achieve the same status as university education. First, there is a long-standing cultural bias that values academic education over vocational education. This bias is particularly strong in many Western countries, where university degrees are seen as the key to social mobility and success, while vocational education is often seen as a second-best option. Second, vocational education has often been associated with low-status jobs and low pay. This has led to a perception that vocational education is less valuable than university education, despite the fact that many vocational careers can be highly rewarding in terms of job satisfaction and financial remuneration. Third, there has historically been a lack of investment in vocational education and training, particularly in terms of resources and infrastructure. This has made it difficult for vocational education to keep pace with changing industry needs and maintain high standards of quality.
