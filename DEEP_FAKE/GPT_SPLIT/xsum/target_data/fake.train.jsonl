{"original_text": "All examples of this group, known as the Archosauromorpha, lay eggs. This led some scientists to wonder whether there was something in their biology that prevented live births. But examination of their fossils and genetic analysis suggests that egg-laying was simply the more advantageous reproductive strategy for these animals. Archosauromorphs include modern-day birds, as well as crocodiles, alligators, and various extinct species such as dinosaurs and pterosaurs. The common ancestor of this diverse group which evolved around 260 million years ago is thought to have laid eggs, and this trait has been conserved throughout the group's evolution. There may have been several reasons for the initial adoption and retention of egg-laying within Archosauromorphs. One hypothesis is that it allowed for greater independence for offspring but also reduced the burden on parents to provide for them. Another is that laying eggs allowed for more precise timing of reproduction, allowing for offspring to be born during periods of the year with favorable conditions for survival. On the other hand, live birth, or viviparity, has evolved multiple times in different groups of animals, including some reptiles such as boas and vipers, as well as mammals and some sharks. In these cases, live birth may have been favored due to environmental factors such as limited nesting sites or protection from predators.

This could be seen as anti-competitive behavior and has raised concerns among manufacture experts and competitors.

{"original_text": "Three years ago, Swedish software consultancy Crisp decided that the answer was no. The firm, which has about 40 staff, had already trialled various organisational structures, including the more common hierarchical model with managers and subordinates. However, they found that this structure didn't work for them as it often led to communication breakdowns and reduced innovation. Instead, Crisp decided to adopt a self-managing organizational structure called Holacracy. This system is based on the principles of distributing power and decision-making throughout the organization. It allows individuals to take on multiple roles and have more autonomy in their work, while still working within a framework of accountability. Under Holacracy, Crisp is divided into various 'circles', each of which is responsible for a different aspect of the business. Within each circle, there are different roles and accountabilities, which are reviewed and updated regularly. There are also meetings where individuals can raise issues and opportunities, and collaboratively work towards a solution. Overall, the Holacracy model has been successful for Crisp. It has helped to foster a culture of transparency, autonomy, and trust, which has led to increased job satisfaction and engagement among employees. Additionally, the company has been able to adapt quickly to changes in the industry and market, as decision-making is more agile and can be made at a local level. Crisp's experience with Holacracy shows that there are alternative ways to structure an organization that can be more effective than traditional hierarchical models.
