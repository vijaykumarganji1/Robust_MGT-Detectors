{"original_text": "For a place open just a matter of weeks The Spot seems to be off to a great start. We arrived to a full house on Saturday evening and settled onto some stools at the bar to enjoy a beer before a table was ready for us. The bar selection was good and the bartender was enthusiastic and welcoming. Built within an old house, The Spot is small; there were only about 10 tables and about 4-6 spots at the bar. Rumor has it there is some outdoor seating but it was a bit too chilly to take advantage of that! They aren't currently taking reservations but who knows if that will change down the road. The ambiance is quite nice; freshly done woodwork, soft lighting, and lined with black white photos on the dark red walls. If I had my choice, the best seats in the house are probably in the bar area or the booths up by the front windows. Two of the booths are right by the kitchen window which has pros and cons; some people love seeing behind the curtain and watching the action. I, on the other hand, find fluorescent kitchen lights to be my kryptonite so I'd rather stick to the more romantic corners of the space. The menu had many tempting options on it for both the vegetarian and the carnivore. Prices were reasonable and a lot sounded tasty. We started with the Baked Artichoke Remikin (6.50) which was served with pickled carrots and crusty bread. We enjoyed it thoroughly; it was a good portion for two or three. For entrees I had the Portabella stew (11) which I enjoyed and the Mister settled on the Wild Boar Sausage (14) and was also pleased. Portions were fair sized, enough for dinner for each of us, not really enough to take home for lunch the next day. Both entrees were served with a side of cooked greens and polenta. The greens were good, the polenta was so salty even Mr.-High-Blood-Pressure himself wasn't interested. This is where The Spot's interest in customer service became evident: our server noticed both of us were bypassing the polenta asked for feedback, which we provided. He did say the kitchen team is still tweaking things and trying to improve everything, of course, so they appreciate hearing customer's thoughts on the food. (Well, you know we're not shy!). We provided feedback on the polenta but assured him that overall they seem to be in great shape. A few minutes later, the owner offered us a complimentary dessert due to the polentapalooza. Yum! Dense chocolate cake, rich and sweet, a perfect end to the meal.

We arrived to a full house on Saturday evening and ensconce onto some stools at the bar to enjoy a beer before a table was ready for us. The bar selection exist good and the bartender exist enthusiastic and welcoming. Built within an old house , The Spot is small ; there were only nigh 10 tables and about 4-6 spots at the bar. Rumor has it there is some outdoor seating but it constitute a bit too chilly to take advantage of that ! They are n't currently taking reservations but who knows if that will change down the road. The ambiance is quite nice ; freshly done woodwork , soft lighting , and draw with black white photos on the dark red walls. If I had my choice , the best seats in the house are probably in the measure area or the booths up by the front windows. Two of the booths are right by the kitchen windowpane which has pros and cons ; some people love seeing behind the curtain and watching the action. I , on the other hand , find fluorescent kitchen lights to be my kryptonite so I 'd rather stick to the more amatory corners of the space. The carte du jour had many tempting options on it for both the vegetarian and the carnivore. Prices make up reasonable and a lot sounded tasty. We started with the Baked Artichoke Remikin ( 6. 50 ) which was served with pickled daucus carota sativa and crusty bread. We enjoyed it thoroughly ; it was a good part for two or three. For entrees I had the Portabella stew ( 11 ) which I enjoyed and the Mister settled on the Wild Boar Sausage ( 14 ) and was likewise pleased. Portions were fair sized , plenty for dinner for each of us , not really enough to take home for lunch the next day. Both entrees were served with a side of cooked viridity and polenta. The super acid were good , the polenta was so salty even Mr. -High-Blood-Pressure himself was n't concerned. This is where The Spot 's pursuit in customer service became evident : our server noticed both of us were bypassing the polenta asked for feedback , which we provided. He cause say the kitchen team is still tweaking things and trying to improve everything , of course , so they appreciate hearing customer 's thoughts on the food. ( Well , you know we 're non shy ! ). We provided feedback on the polenta but assured him that overall they look to be in great shape.

Beet Salad - Red beets topped with some fruit, half crispy with small seeds (like a kiwi). Refreshing! Duck Confit - Served atop halved roasted brussel sprouts. The duck was pure and game-y, as duck confit should be as it's cooked in its own fat. I encouraged my hubby to pick up the bone and gnaw off the crispy parts. Magnificent. Croque Monsieur - served with shoestring fries; appropriately rich with the sauce and sunnyside egg on top but not overly salty like other versions I've had. Gnocchi a la Parisienne - I decided on this dish thinking it would be lighter and make up for all the food we had beforehand. Boy, was I wrong. First off, these aren't potato dumplings.

It 's nice to induce a sittin ' place downtown. The ambiance is corporate comfortfake hardwood floors , wooden chairs , bogus fireplace. The place is clean , the tables have space to ferment , and there 's a few comfy chairs to sit in and read. A plus make up the free Wifi. The solid food ai n't bad. The bakery products are freshthe muffin are tasty ( they 'll also offer to warm it up for you ). There 's a light lunch menu too ( wrap , bagel sandwiches ). I 've had the club wrap and it 's jolly well put together ( bacon : crispy. meleagris gallopavo : fresh. lettuce : fresh ). They ingest a daily soup as well : decent-enough. The real score with this shoes is that they offer gelato. Ice cream for lunch ! Score ! It 's decent to have another cafe downtown. There are few enough places to get food. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "We stayed here for a bachelorette party during Labor Day weekend. We were 9 people in total, and wanted to be able to stay pretty much in a large suite without spending a fortune. Palms Place suited that bill nicely. While we'd originally booked a 2-bedroom suite and adjoining room, at check-in we upgraded to a penthouse suite and added a couple roll-away beds so we could all be in 1 room. Best decision we ever made, as it was only a couple hundred bucks more per night (split 9 ways, natch). Unfortunately for both us and the Palms Place staff, there were TONS of issues with the first suite they put us in. A couple girls got locked the master bath on at least 3 separate occasions, the hot tub on the balcony didn't work, the fireplace didn't work, and we didn't have an ice maker, just to name a few. After several unsuccessful repairs, the staff relented and relocated us to a bigger suite one level up for our last night. Then they gave us a hard time about getting additional roll-away beds so everyone had a place to sleep, which was unfortunate. While the problems with the rooms led to a less-than-ideal experience, we were all quite thrilled to be staying in a couple awesome suites, with a hot tub overlooking the Strip. Not too shabby, all things considered. While on future Vegas trips, I might opt to stay closer to the action, if ever I needed a single room for 6 people and didn't want to spend a fortune, Palms Place would be it.", "text_perturb": "We continue here for a bachelorette party during Labor Day weekend.
