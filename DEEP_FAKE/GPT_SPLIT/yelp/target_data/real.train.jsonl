{"original_text": "Food: Ginza offers traditional Japanese cuisine ranging from hibachi to sushi to noodles, with plenty of appetizers and deserts as well. We started with the miso soup, which was just fine and warmed us up on a cold winter night. We followed with the edamame appetizer. Its hard to mess up edamame, and Ginza definitely didn't, but the dish could have used more seasoning to make an otherwise average dish stand out. There were other interesting appetizer choices, like seaweed salad, fresh spring rolls, and avocado salad, all of which are probably worth considering instead of the edamame. We then ordered the vegetable sushi roll, which contained avocado, asparagus, and cucumber (any of these could also be ordered individually within a roll). The roll consisted of six large pieces and was fresh and well made. There were four enticing vegetarian entrees on the menu; tofu vegetable teriyaki, tofu tempura, vegetable hibachi, and vegetable udon noodles. The udon noodles can be prepared pan-fried or in broth soup-style. The pan-fried udon noodles were quite bland, covered in a sauce that had little to no flavor or spice. The tofu teriyaki was slightly more interesting, with a thicker, more tasty sauce, but wasn't anything memorable and some of the vegetables were cold on the inside. The tofu was prepared crunchy out the outside but very wet and soft on the inside. Ginza does not put any hot sauce, pepper seeds, or chili paste on the table, and also do not offer a spiciness scale, so you can't really adjust what you get on your plate to accomodate for a lack of flavor. The lead-ins to the main course were not bad but not great, and the entrees were pretty lackluster. Overall, it seems as if Ginza doesn't have experience designing and preparing vegetarian items. Meat and fish eaters would likely have more success finding something satisfying. Price: The prices were very reasonable, as we ordered two soups, an appetizer, a sushi roll, and two entrees for under 30. We were hungry, so we didn't have enough left to bring home (although we may not have taken leftovers anyways due to lack of flavor), but the portion sizes are above average. Drinks: Ginza is BYOB but they do offer Japanese teas and sodas in addition to regular fountain drinks. Atmosphere: The restaurant is decorated very nicely with darkly painted walls and candlelit tables. There are tables for small and large parties, and enough space so that you aren't sitting directly on top of your neighbors. However, the restaurant is basically one big room and when the door opens on a cold night, you can feel the chilly air rush in if you are anywhere near the front. It isn't too difficult to find a parking spot on Liberty or one of its side streets. Service: We were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant and provided menus and glasses of water. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, often checking our table and re-filling our water. We requested an addition of tofu to the udon noodles, which the waitress approved, but when the plate came the tofu was missing. We were also served our appetizer, sushi, and entrees within five minutes of each other, creating a table full of hot food getting cold.: cheap prices, large portions: average to below-average vegetarian food Would I go back again?

When I finally say down she explained to me the process before she started she offered me a great deal includes hair treatments or conditioning with cut and colorhighlights for 175. To be honest with you I have never paid that much to get my hair done. Anyways, she told me before she starts that I have to sign this paper to pretty much proves that I agree that I'm paying 175.

I showed her the picture of how I want the color again and she kept on insisting on chili when The picture looks like blonde brown and light brown. I told her I want what I see in the picture... After a long process of being in the dryer and washer I thought that the color is finally showing up because she showed a little bit if the strip of my hair. Long story short, nothing changed! I got the hair cut! She offered me products and I bought one! But the color stayed the same from when I came in. I love how she went step by step before she did my hair and she said in time it will slowly lighten but honesty I paid 200 to make my hair look like something got done and it was such waste.

The last few times we have gone in we are met with an attitude of indifference at the door that seems to permeate the wait staff. Waited a long time to for our first contact with the waitress, though she was pleasant. Seems she had customers on the patio as well as inside and was spread thin, so it was a long time between visits. First beer came timely, but could not get the attention of anyone for a refill when our food came. A different waitress dropped off our food (and that was literally what she did) and quickly turned away and did not ask if we needed anything else. Furthermore, she went out of her way to avoid our conspicuous attempts to get her attention for something we needed. In the meantime our first waitress was busy on the patio and, apparently, waitress 2 was not happy that she had to serve us our food, because she continued to ignore our attempt to get her attention, even glaring and looking through me at one point. Although this was Trivia night (for the life of me I don't understand what a restaurant gets out of this since most participants seem to only buy drinks), the place was not crowded or busy and there seemed to be plenty of employees to go around the room and tend to the customers that were present. This is only an account of the third bad experience we have had with service. There have been others, interspersed with satisfactory experiences. We both have many years in the restaurant business and our assessment of the reason for this uneven experience falls on management. First, choose people that are committed to the success of your business. There are many competitors out there waiting to take your place if you stumble. Second, management has the responsibility to make certain staff is well schooled in how to deal with customers, including the technique of scanning the room and making eye contact with those that seem to be looking for something. There are usually additional sales involved in doing this competently. Third, management needs to be present and observant so that when it is apparent things are not going well, they can do what they are paid to do, i.e. make it right.

Furthermore , she went out of her way to avoid our conspicuous attempts to fetch her attention for something we needed. In the meantime our first waitress was busy on the patio and , apparently , waitress 2 was not happy that she had to serve us our food , because she continued to ignore our attempt to get her aid , even glaring and looking through me at one point. Although this was Trivia night ( for the life of me I do n't empathize what a restaurant gets out of this since most participants seem to only buy drinks ) , the place was not crowded or busy and there seemed to be plenty of employees to go around the room and tend to the customers that were present. This is only an account of the third regretful experience we have had with service. There have been others , interspersed with satisfactory experience. We both have many years in the eating place business and our assessment of the reason for this uneven experience falls on management. First , choose people that are perpetrate to the success of your business. There are many competitors out there waiting to subscribe to your place if you stumble. Second , management has the responsibility to make certain staff is well schooled in how to deal with customers , including the technique of glance over the room and making eye contact with those that seem to be looking for something. There are usually extra sales involved in doing this competently. Third , management needs to be present and observant so that when it is apparent thing are not going well , they can do what they are paid to do , i. due east. relieve oneself it right. You only get so many bites at this malus pumila HAPH , so you better get it right or Gilbert ends up with yet another vacant building with a For Lease sign in the window. ", "label": 1}

I always advise my friends not to play things up in their minds, because the fall is only that much harder from the heights that we all are capable of building in our minds. Unfortunately, I did not take my own advice on this one.:) I had a vision of retiring to the snow room with my freshly brewed tea, made by the Tea Sommelier. Coming from a heavily Asian influenced area, and recognizing both the health benefits and beauty of an individually brewed cup of tea, by none less than a Sommelier, I was really sold on this aspect. Truthfully though, it is only instant tea packets for you to serve yourself. When I asked about the Sommelier, the front desk had to call and ask management what a Sommelier was. Now, this alone was only one strike, but in truth, it was the final strike. I was also dissatisfied with the strands of hair that were left in the brushes, basking in the blue lights to disinfect, for your complimentary use; the salty pretzels (only snack if you happen to have been in a rush to get to your appointment); no disposable razors should you need shave in the shower; and most importantly...when asked to be in the tea room, 5minutes before my service, I was picked up for my appointment 5 minutes after my start time. I was then released a few minutes early. I was not given a 50 minute time slot for my facial, and there was no massage in the hands or shoulders, rather a lathering of lotion that I just wanted to wipe off. And, after that lathering, I was left a tab (which I paid and tipped on prior to arrival) and asked to sign it, so as to add additional tip, if I so saw fit. AWKWARD! Most comical though was my interaction with the staff (wont mention name) who told me that the Tea Sommelier was on her lunch break, after I had been there for 2 hours and seen no one. She kindly offered to make me an instant cup of tea. Eventually we were able to agree that no Tea Somellier was going to arrive after any lunch break. Lol. The spa itself was lovely, but I am a firm believer that when you advertise 50 min. service, you provide 50 minute service. When you advertise Tea Somellier, you have one on site. If it's no longer available, the website should have been fixed. I was researching the website for months before I booked this appointment (remember that the front desk did not even know what a Tea Somellier was so it gives you an idea of how long it had been since a Somellier had been on premises), and am looking at it a week later and it has not been updated.

{"original_text": "The Marquee Theatre is pretty much like going to your horrible mother-in-laws house. Its a terrible idea that you fret over... But you go because there is some bomb ass reward, like a home cooked meal, chocolate mousse pie and a bottle of champagne not even your wealthiest friend could afford, and because well, you have to, to keep your marriage together. The Marquee is like this. I go because one of the loves of my music life are playing a show there and I wouldn't miss it for the world... I cant miss it!

Don't piss off the security guards either, they are all obviously raging roid monkeys that will kick you out for even looking at them wrong.

{"original_text": "I'm only giving this motel a 4 star instead of 5 because I can't imagine giving any motel 5 stars. I have stayed at this motel 4 times now. I stay at this motel because it is close to my favorite mega resort corner, but without the price tag of those mega resorts. From this motel I can easily access the Tropicana or Excalibur for some 5 black jack. Hooters next door has 3 black jack but I really don't like the Hooters Casino Hotel (see other review). I can also go to NYNY to get some Big Apple style eats. On top of all that, the nightclubs LAX and Studio 54 are within walking distance. Although, lately I've been finding myself at the new club in Hard Rock at least one night each stay. The Lobby: Is always surprisingly active and lively. Often times motel lobbies are dingy and quiet with the only sign of life being the person behind the counter - and even that can be a stretch. This motel is much different. There are usually 2-3 helpful staff members behind the counter, 1 attendant at the tourism desk and several guests in the lounge area using the internet. Check-in is always quick and easy. I always buy my internet at check-in. The best Wi-Fi deal in Vegas (only 324 hour period) The Rooms: There are essentially two options at this motel. The upgraded rooms and the standardclassic rooms. The upgraded rooms are actually very nice. You can start to forget you are in a cheap motel while watching your flat screen TV and walking on your faux wood floor. The bathrooms are very spacious with walk-in showers and clean tiling. The biggest downside to the upgraded rooms is the fact that they took space away from the bedroom portion to make room for the larger bathrooms. The beds are much closer together than I would have liked. If you are traveling alone or with one other person, this isn't much of an issue. I was in the room with three other people so it got a little cramped and was pretty disgusting by the time we left because we just didn't have enough space to put everything and keep it organized. There are no dressers if that is something you look for. The standardclassic rooms are what one would normally expect from a motel. Old, patterned comforters, dark carpeting, cramped bathrooms and outdated televisions. The beds are slightly more comfortable than the beds in the upgraded rooms (different style all together) and there is a lot more space in the bedroom area to spread out your stuff. Another advantage to the standard rooms is that you can ask for a room in the quieter building toward the back of the property. If you want space and a quieter atmosphere, I would suggest getting the standard room and requesting such. All of the upgraded rooms are in the building closest to the lobby. Dining: You can have food delivered to the motel easily, but why bother when there is a great 247 bakerydiner right next door called CoCo's. CoCo's is a chain restaurant but still maintains a diner feel and there are rarely any problems with food. In a 3 day period I typically go to CoCo's for brunch, a late dinner and a late night make me sober meal. Plus, if you want you can walk a few minutes more and go to Hooter's or any of the other mega resorts on the corner. There is also a convenience store adjacent to the lobby where you can grab quick snacks and drinks. Pool: I have no idea what the pool is like at this hotel. I never have the urge to use it. I tend to go over to Hooter's, Tropicana or Excalibur to use their pools. Tropicana is always open to the public (although you need to provide your own towel since they will demand a room number if you try to use theirs), Hooter's is open to the public, Excalibur is technically closed to the public (but everyone can easily get a towel before entering the pool area) but they only have a security guard glancing at room keys at peak entry hours. Plus, I'm pretty sure you could flash your grocery store savings card and it would work. I would suggest Excalibur for the most open air lounging space and I especially love the adults only pool area of Excalibur. Cleanliness: The rooms, lobby, bathrooms and parking lot have always been clean. I definitely leave the room much worse than I find it. This motel is definitely my go-to budget room in Vegas.", "text_perturb": "I 'm only giving this motel a 4 star instead of 5 because I ca n't envisage giving any motel 5 stars.

Often times motel lobbies are dingy and quiet with the only sign of life being the person behind the counter - and even that displace be a stretch. This motel is much different. There are usually 2-3 helpful staff members behind the counter , 1 attendant at the tourism desk and several guests in the lounge country using the internet. check in is always quick and easy. I always buy my cyberspace at check-in. The best Wi-Fi deal in Vegas ( only 324 hour period ) The rooms : There are essentially two options at this motel. The upgraded rooms and the standardclassic rooms. The upgraded rooms are actually rattling nice. You can start to forget you are in a cheap motel while watching your flat screen TV and walk on your faux wood floor. The bathrooms are very spacious with walk-in showers and light tiling. The biggest downside to the upgraded rooms is the fact that they took space away from the bedroom dower to make room for the larger bathrooms. The beds are much closer together than I would have care. If you cost traveling alone or with one other person , this is n't much of an issue. I was in the room with three other people so it got a little cramped and was pretty disgusting by the time we left because we just come n't have enough space to put everything and keep it organized. There represent no dressers if that is something you look for. The standardclassic rooms embody what one would normally expect from a motel. Old , patterned comforters , dark carpeting , cramped bathrooms and outdated tv set. The beds are slightly more comfortable than the beds in the upgraded rooms ( different style all together ) and there is a wad more space in the bedroom area to spread out your stuff. Another advantage to the standard rooms is that you can ask for a elbow room in the quieter building toward the back of the property. If you want space and a quieter atmosphere , I would suggest getting the standard way and requesting such. All of the upgraded rooms are in the building closest to the pressure group. Dining : You can have food delivered to the motel easily , but why bother when there is a big 247 bakerydiner right next door called CoCo 's. CoCo 's is a chain restaurant but still maintains a diner smell and there are rarely any problems with food. In a 3 day period I typically go to CoCo 's for brunch , a late dinner and a late nighttime make me sober meal. Plus , if you want you fire walk a few minutes more and go to Hooter 's or any of the other mega resorts on the corner. There is also a convenience store adjacent to the lobby where you can grab immediate snacks and drinks. pocket billiards : I have no idea what the pool is like at this hotel. I neer have the urge to use it. I tend to go over to Hooter 's , Tropicana or Excalibur to use their pool. Tropicana is always open to the public ( although you need to provide your own towel since they will demand a room number if you try to use theirs ) , Hooter 's is open to the public , Excalibur is technically closed to the public ( but everyone can easily get a towel before insert the pool area ) but they only have a security guard glancing at room keys at peak entry hours. Plus , I 'm pretty sure you could flash your grocery store economy card and it would work. I would suggest Excalibur for the most open air lounging space and I especially love the adults exclusively pool area of Excalibur. Cleanliness : The rooms , lobby , bathrooms and parking wad have always been clean. I definitely leave the room lots worse than I find it. This motel is definitely my go-to budget way in Vegas.

Just because you have a flashlight that you like to play lightshows with does n't have in mind you ca n't walk BEHIND us when clearly , there 's a bunch of space BEHIND us. Stop walk in between us , pushing us - I would rather NOT be touched by you every time you want to walk in between us girls. Reminds me of the pathetic staff and faculty we had back at high school terpsichore because my friends got low. 3. Line for re-entry and you need to get a printed theme saying how many are in your group. This is totally bogus - they STAMP you for a reason , so that it 's well to do to get in. Thanks for killing more than trees , Haze. 3. Music was decent the july 4th weekend ( better than XS the following night - strange , is n't it ? ) , but there are way too many predatorscreepers here. Guys grabbing my waist , trying to grab my hand , accidentally grazing my posterior , etc. Also , some bozo was jumping all around and scraped my ankle with his sneakers. NO thanks. 4. 40 for guys , seriously ? ! And they class the girls from the guys. Guys , just go to XS where the lady are hotter ( beach nights , anyone ? ) and you either pay 30 for cover or can potentially get in FOR FREE. 5. Drinks follow splashing everywhere. Come on , people - do n't carry your drinks onto the dance level ! It 's that simple ! You 'll just waste 20 and only get a tiny sip of it before it spills or slips out of your hand. Sorry Haze , you are no bueno. ;", "label": 1}

SERVICE here has always been top of the line. I wouldn't expect anything else from within a Steve Wynn property. Water glasses are always filled and the table is frequently straightened out and picked up, be it actual platessilverware or the microscopic piece of a sugar packet. First of all: THE BREAD.

However, there is a drawback...one time we were here, I hadn't eaten almost all day, so I quickly devoured almost three of these rolls. I was full for the rest of the dinner...whoops. THE SALADS: TIP! Make sure you split these with someone else at your table. These lettuce and vegetable concoctions are monstrously sized and are worthy of the cut in half. Caesar: Standard Caesar, but I really like the tangier-and-creamier-than-normal dressing and the Parmesan crisp. (Steve's?) Chopped Vegetable: Phenomenal. The avocado adheres the vegetables together and it is smoooooth sailing. Wedge: Ask for the dressing on the side! Also, there is a large offering of thick-cut bacon on the side, just off the cooker. AMAZING. Uhh...is there a trend with the bacon here? THE STEAKS: I have had steak here each time, naturally. And out of the six or so times, I would say five of them have been incredible.

Au Gratin Potatoes: Some of the best I've had, but too rich. I always eat the least of these because they're so rich and filling. I know we've had other sides..but I can't think of them at the moment. THE DESSERT: Funnel Cakes: I promise you...this will be the perfect cap on your evening. The 5 or so fried dough pieces come hanging on a foot-tall metal tree presentation, accompanied by a trio of sauces: Chocolate, Salted Caramel, and a Vanilla one. The vanilla one is worth licking the bowl for.

The waiter filleted the fish, and took so long it was cold when she served it. The fish was flavourless and cold, and the accompanying zuchinnis were tasteless and the fried potatoes tasted like they were the frozen variety.

If they wanted to they could just refill the cup rather of providing a brand new one. . . . .

First impressions: Being in Vegas it's got that upscale feel to it. We had a short line when we got there, about a 15 min. wait, and the giant interactive menu on the wall is sweet. The bar is very cool with the ice wall behind the taps, and the open kitchen and the flames along the walls are nice eye candy. Service: Service was excellent! The bartenders were great and our server was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and attentive. Love the iPad that you get that shows the drink list and gives descriptions. Draft selection was small but had a nice variety and great quality beers. Food: We ordered the Farm burger, Euro burger and the Brittania, and they were every bit as amazing as I was hoping they'd be. The burger patties themselves were out of this world. Cooked perfectly to order. Moist and tender on the inside, and a phenomenal mouthfeel and chew. The blend of cuts was awesome, and the texture of the short rib in particular was stellar. The natural taste of the beef really shined through, and the fact that they're grilled over a wood fire gives them an added depth of flavor that you just can't get with a plain gas grill like most other burger restaurants use. A burger patty should be good enough that you could eat it on its own, with any sauces or toppings only serving to compliment the protein, and that was definitely the case here. The Farm burger with its duck bacon and quail egg was ridiculously delicious. The Brittania with the mango chutney had a nice sweetness to it. My personal favorite was the Euro burger. The goat cheese and truffle aioli just sent the burger over the top. In each burger the different flavors were perfectly balanced. The jalapeno poppers were really good, as were the onion rings. The chipotle ketchup that came with the rings was particularly tasty. I wish I could've brought a bottle of that stuff home with me. Is it more expensive than most other burgers? Yes. Is it overpriced? No. Could you find bigger, heavier burgers? Yes. Is it any less satisfying? No. Some people have this idea that the more a burger costs, the bigger it should be. Uh, no.

The patio, without misters, is uninviting, with a very odd mixture of seat cushions for the wrought iron furniture. It was even more off-putting because most of the tables were loaded with dirty dishes. There was one hard working busboy who couldn't keep up with the mess. It wasn't much better indoors - messy and noisy (the noise of the cars being replaced by very loud music). You place your order at the counter. Breakfast is served daily from 6:30 AM to 4 PM. There are pancakes, plain or with apple compote (6) or with bananas, caramel, creme fraiche and peanuts (7). Eggs, scrambled or fried, come with MJ toast and a choice of bacon, ham, sausage, or chorizo (6). Various egg sandwiches and omelets range from 6 to 8. But we had come for lunch.

The ventilation is not very good and if you 're there for hours , maybe you 'll exactly get used to the stench. 2. ) The receptionist was not helpful , condescending , and roleplay like helping us was too much out of the way. Probably just got used to regulars and is real nice to them. But to fledgling , forget it. My first cousin is the nicest guy you could ever meet and will even go out of his way to buy food for the poor. He just was n't worth the metre to be given good service to I think.

In MY opinion, this is the best Mexican restaurant I have been to in terms of authenticity.

The GOOD: The salsa is very good...fresh ingredients give it a little bit of chunk and the flavor is perfect. It is a little runny but I don't like salsa that has been thickened by paste or because it was pureed. I would rather the flavor with chunks of onion and pieces of cilantroand that is what this place offers. The BADThey serve the salsa in a very small dish and they have a disclaimer on the menu that indicates only the first two rounds of chips and salsa are free. I mean, what? I understand we are in a tough economic situation but you can't be a mexican restaurant and charge for chips and salsa. We have managed to avoid that extra charge so far. We usually just ask a different person for more salsa every time...I know, a little dishonest, but I can't help it! I expect a charge when you go to some random place and happen to order chips and salsa as your appetizer (like Chili's or something) but any standard, hole-in-the-wall Mexican place should NOT do such a thing. THE EXCELLENT: Their fresh, tableside guacamole! WOW! I had no idea avocados could have so much flavor. It was fantastic. The flavors were bold and boasted of fresh cilantro, onion, and lime! It was such a perfect combination of flavors. I have had it with the jalapenos and without...either way was incredible! I typically get the veggie fajitas and that is another reason why I love this place. TYPICALLY, if I order veggie fajitas I end up with onions and peppers marinated in salt. Azteca sends out grilled onions, peppers, tomatoes, squash, broccoli and mushrooms. They are not weighted down with sodium and dripping in a fajita sauce....they are grilled and fresh. It really is perfectly done! The beans and rice and pretty basicnothing to speak about. The flour tortillas are great and their pico de gallo is fresh and flavorful. One other downfall is that they don't give you the option for black beans on the side. But, what I found out is that black beans are not as authentic in terms of Mexican food. Muy interesante!

I came frugal-minded, knowing that I would not do much sleeping and keeping in mind a certain Yelper's admonition you get what you pay for I got even less than what I paid for. I booked a week in advance, for Saturday and Sunday night. I picked the cheapest standard room for Saturday and a Spa Suite for Sunday, Sunday being the much cheaper night of the two. When I came on Saturday, they sent me right to an upgraded room. This would have been cool if it was a Smoking King bed like I wanted instead of a Non smoking double. My 6 foot big ass boyfriend and I cannot fit in no double bed. I called room service to get this rectified and came in contact with the rudest, bitchiest motherfucking concierges I have ever encountered.

I get that it 's a buffet and you 're getting your own food , but people do n't forget to tip at least a few bucks for those who are fetch you drinks and clearing off those tables.

We'd wave him, he'd say he'll be back and doesn't come back to us or he would walk passed us like we didn't wave at all. A few people had lost orders and instead of saying something kind like sorry, let me go check on that and get it out....it's more of remarks like we never put the order, you got it (no someone else got it),etc. One of our Yelpers asked three times to get her first order when the other side already on their 2nd round of orders. I was gonna do 3 stars but now with tge transactions, I'm miffed. First, they wont split the bill and kinda told us we had to just deal with it because they're busy.

We had a Korean speaking Yelper go talk to him and he was rude about it so she went to talk to the manager who said he will do it in a bit. We had to wait for him and explain everything. It took like 20 minutes of discussing things and explaining how we wrote down what before they went to the back to start. We have no choice but to wait. I'm sorry, but one thing I learned about restaurant hospitality that turnover is important because waiting for a check lowers the impression farther than waiting a bit for good food. People are done and want to just go. We finally got our receipts back and...... they charge my credit card for two drinks and two AYCE. We wrote everything down clearly on the back on to receipt. We put the last 4 digits of each card to identify them and what amount to charge to each card. HOW is that NOT clear enough? They charged me for someone else. Okay, so basically then they should give me some cash back then bring back the cash people some change. Well, first time they not only gave me less than what I was owed, but also no change for people with cash. They finally gave it and we left at 9:40pm. 50 minutes to transact is pretty crazy long. I know it's easy to say that well, it's a pretty a-typical effed up situation. That maybe with the busy place and a waitstaff that doesn't micromanage it well it went down south fast. However, I do have previous visits where I do specifically state how odd the service was odd, not friend and inefficient so that holds true that the waiter service isn't that good here. Also, it got super busy on my last visit towards the end of my dinner and I also waited 20 minutes to get a mochi and 15 minutes more to get my check back to sign so I was held hostage prior to this.

Most hotels pools are only like 4-5 deep due to fear of drowning liability. I am a huge rooter of deep pools and rare they are to find. So for me that is another nice feature to this dimension. It is in a quiet area of town and lots of corking things around to do. . . just 3 miles from camel Back Drive and tons to do on that road. . . The surrounding beauty makes this property even nicer if you happen flaws which every hotel will have. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "First timers in our group and at least 2 or the 3 of us will not be back. We (two of us) arrived to the table our friend had already been seated at to hear the manager, I presume, say to her You're having a great time, just by yourself, aren't you? as he placed the appetizer she had ordered on the table. After announcing ourselves, we sat and soon after the server, Beth, came to the table. Honestly, I had to check my receipt for her name because she never told it to us. Since we didn't know our drink order right away, we agreed she would return for it. At least 10 minutes later, she returns for what turned out to be our simple beer order. After we had selected our sushi choices for our meal, Beth verbally ran through the choices. After explaining that the rolls will all come out as they are prepared so we are not waiting, our friend asks if the Mango Tango selection can be put on a separate plate as she is allergic to mangoes. After clear confusion on the face of Beth, she stutters out I think we can do that. We were thrown by her confusion. As our first plate of rolls arrived, delivered by someone other than our server, we had no wasabi and no small dishes for our sauce on the table. The soy sauce pitcher on our table was almost empty as was the one on the table next to us. After about 10 minutes, Beth arrives to check on how our rolls taste and we inform her that we hadn't had any due to lack of wasabi and dishes. Beth leaves to get those items for us and tell us to get started with the small amount of soy sauce we had left in our pitcher. The Mango Tango dish arrives and Beth's confusion was answered: the mango was on the side. She had apparently thought we were requesting for the mango to be in the side instead of the meal on a separate plate from the rolls. After our meal was finished and we were chatting and enjoying our company, drinking our beverages, Beth arrives and places the bill on the table, telling us she will pick it up whenever we are ready. No mention of coffee or dessert. When we hadn't touched the check for 10 minutes, Beth checks in to see if it's ready. When we told her we hadn't even looked at it yet, she says If you would like to hang out and order anything else, I can have another server assist you. I have been here since 10 and would like to close out your check. It was 9pm.

Not to be insensitive at all, I, myself have been a server and a bartender in the past and I am all too familiar with pulling a double. And I have been stuck at work because of that last table that consisted of people not going anywhere. It wasn't that she wanted to leave, it was the way she told us. I had just worked a full day myself and was about to do it again the next day, in the midst of a 3 week straight work schedule with 0 days off. Once we paid our bill, cash and card combo that again confused Beth, we added our gratuity and our meal was complete. But not before Beth checked her tip while still very much in our range of vision. Oh, and the sushi? Mediocre at best and not worth going back!", "text_perturb": "First timers in our group and at least 2 or the 3 of us will not cost back. We ( two of us ) arrived to the table our friend had already been seated at to hear the manager , I presume , say to her You 're having a great time , precisely by yourself , are n't you ? as he placed the appetizer she had ordered on the table. After herald ourselves , we sat and soon after the server , Beth , came to the table. Honestly , I had to check my receipt for her name because she neer told it to us. Since we did n't know our drink rescript right away , we agreed she would return for it. At least 10 minutes later , she returns for what turn out to be our simple beer order. After we had selected our sushi choices for our meal , beth verbally ran through the choices. After explaining that the rolls will all come out as they are prepared so we are non waiting , our friend asks if the Mango Tango selection can be put on a separate plate as she is allergic to mangoes. After clear confusion on the face of Beth , she stutters out I think we can coif that. We were thrown by her mix up. As our first plate of rolls arrived , delivered by someone other than our host , we had no wasabi and no small dishes for our sauce on the table. The soy sauce pitcher on our table represent almost empty as represent the one on the table next to us. After about 10 minutes , Beth make it to check on how our rolls taste and we inform her that we had n't had any due to lack of wasabi and dishes. Beth leaves to get those items for us and recite us to get started with the small amount of soy sauce we had left in our pitcher. The Mango Tango dish arrives and Beth 's confusion was answered : the mango was on the face. She had apparently thought we were requesting for the mangifera indica to be in the side instead of the meal on a separate plate from the rolls. After our meal was finished and we were chatting and enjoying our company , drinking our beverages , Beth arrives and places the bill on the board , telling us she will pick it up whenever we are ready. No mention of coffee or sweet. When we had n't touched the tick for 10 minutes , Beth checks in to see if it 's ready. When we told her we had n't even looked at it yet , she says If you would like to hang out and order anything else , I can have another host assist you. I have been here since 10 and would like to conclude out your check. It constitute 9pm.

Our first day in Vegas we hit up the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort, so needless to say More at Luxor was a step down...literally because the place is located in the basement of the Luxor. That said, it is easily the best food I've ever eaten inside of a basement. If you stick to the normal food here, it's hard to find much to complain about. First we had the breakfast buffet and the sausage, eggs, bacon, and omelette bar were solid and great for filling up to start the day. There were only two things on the breakfast buffet that were so bad I couldn't swallow a bite: the biscuits and gravy, and the sausage and egg burrito. I don't know what was inside of that so-called burrito, but it damn sure wasn't anything I would ever use at home. The biscuits and gravy was more bland than disgusting, and after a night of downing straight shots of tequila with no problem, it should say a lot that I didn't have the courage to take more than one bite of their hard biscuit or nasty gravy. For dinner, it's pretty much standard Hometown Buffet or Golden Corrall food. Nothing here is going to blow you away like you would find at Wicked Spoon or Studio B, but there are a few tasty items to be tried. First, the Buffalo Shrimp are pretty amazing. I've never had Buffalo Shrimp but I had to have eaten 2 plates of the shrimp alone. Second, the carved turkey was very good and paired with the mashed potatoes and gravy, I have to say was surprisingly Thanksgiving-like. So definitely some decent food for dinner to be had but there were more than a few duds. The pizza - Imagine if Digiorno came out with a new pizza called Flavorless. That's More's pizza in a nutshell. The crust and texture were Digiorno, but the sauce and everything else tasted like moist paper towels. The Chicken - I don't know how you fuck up chicken because it has to be up there with scrambled eggs on the list of The Most Impossible Foods to Ruin but More manages to do a great job at doing a poor job preparing chicken. Tons of fat, no flavor, gooey texture, etc. It tasted the way I would imagine chewing on a human kidney would be. So all in all, More is great if you can get it at a discount and stick to basic foods offered in order to recharge your batteries and get something in your stomach. However, if you're spending the full 26 to get int he buffet, I would suggest the extra 14 at Wicked Spoon or heading down the road to Flamingo's Paradise Buffet for the same price.", "text_perturb": "Let me preface this by saying I got the all day buffet for free , and normally it be given 38.

{"original_text": "I must say.... I was really looking forward to having dinner here. We were on a quick weekend get away in Scottsdale for my 32nd birthday, and I booked this place to celebrate with the love of my life. Boy oh boy, what a disappointment!!! We arrived, and I was impressed with the atmosphere, decor, and the fantastic view stretching across the phoenix urban sprawl. When we checked in with reception, we were informed that we would have a 10mn wait to be seated outside. 10mn? Not a problem!, I said, and continued on to state that we would grab a drink at the bar and sit outside to take a look at the view, while we waited to be seated in the dining area. And we waited. And waited. And waited. All the time, seeing free seats being taken by others (although there was no one waiting behind us). We ended up asking about it, and they were quite rude, did not apologize, and ended up telling us that they had been looking for us, but we were no where to be found, which is IMHO a load of bullocks, given that we had made eye contact with the floor manager several times during our wait. In the end, we got seated by the bus table, still outside, my mood souring by the minute.... but hey, it was my birthday, I wasn't going to let something like that ruin the moment. I wasn't surprised by the prices, as I knew what we were getting into. I was however, surprised by the crappy quality of the dinner we had for the we paid. They brought the perfunctory amuse gueule, which was a joke, to be honest. If I was a restaurant manager, I would be literally embarrassed by what they deigned to serve: 2 table spoons of some sort of artichoke bisque served in a large mug.... makes you feel like someone scraped the bottom of a soup pan and was serving you yesterday's leftovers from the local penitentiary. I was quite unimpressed. Gordon Ramsey would have had a fit. At this point, we were also annoyed with the high powered, halogenic lights, that are pointed right in your face, literally blinding you when the beams catch you at the right angle.... I was starting to have a head ache, as was my wife. They then came around to serve us some bread and pesto butter, which I must say was pretty nice tasting..... (but come on,.... how hard is it to screw up bread??). We perused the wine menu, and decided to order a South African white chardonnay, from the Stellen Bosch region (Mirlest white).... which was pretty good. Nice touch was that we didn't finish the bottle, and they re-corked and bagged it for us before leaving.... which was a plus... As a starter, I had the pan seared foie gras.... which was a bit too gelatinous for my liking (have had way better).... the waffles were a nice touch. It reminds me of a restaurant in Paris that used to serve foie gras with ginger bread.... quite nice.... the sweet and salty combo always works wonders. My wife ordered the Chevre walnut tarte.... one piece of advice.... stay the hell away from it. Its mainly a medley of thick, sandy crust and walnut powder, with ABSOLUTELY NO DETECTABLE trace amounts of goat cheese..... For 11, it was an absolute rip off. The server initially didn't react when we told him that this dish was absolutely not a success.... however, he did later take it off the bill. My wife just had a really unlucky evening. Being vegetarian, she ordered the Vegetarian Trilogy. What this ended up being was a soggy vegetable lasagna, served with a supposed macademia truffle sauce that tasted more like peanut butter, except that it was even more bland and greasy..... The truffle scented gnoccis that we ordered as a side dish, looked like, and tasted like stale, soggy, greasy fries.... yuck. I however ordered the diver's scallops and lobster, which was pretty good. Not the softest lobster, but damn tasty, and the scallops were perfect, and huuuge. No dessert, as we were pretty disgusted with the whole experience.

We finish up asking about it , and they were quite rude , did not apologize , and finish up telling us that they had been looking for us , but we were no where to be found , which is IMHO a load of bullocks , given that we had made eye contact with the floor manager several times during our wait. In the end , we got seated by the bus table , still outside , my humour souring by the minute. . . . but hey , it was my natal day , I was n't going to let something like that ruin the moment. I was n't surprised by the prices , as I bang what we were getting into. I live however , surprised by the crappy quality of the dinner we had for the we paid. They get the perfunctory amuse gueule , which was a joke , to be honest. If I was a restaurant manager , I would be literally embarrassed by what they deigned to serve : 2 table spoons of some sort of artichoke bisque served in a big mug. . . . get to you feel like someone scraped the bottom of a soup pan and was serving you yesterday 's leftovers from the local penitentiary. I follow quite unimpressed. Gordon Ramsey would induce had a fit. At this point , we were also bother with the high powered , halogenic lights , that are pointed right in your face , literally blinding you when the beams catch you at the right angle. . . . I equal starting to have a head ache , as equal my wife. They then came around to serve us some bread and pesto butter , which I must say personify pretty nice tasting. . . . . ( but make out on ,. . . . how hard is it to screw up bread ? ? ). We peruse the wine menu , and decided to order a South African white chardonnay , from the Stellen Bosch region ( Mirlest white ). . . . which exist pretty good. Nice touch was that we did n't finish the bottle , and they re-corked and bag it for us before leaving. . . . which be a plus. . . As a starter , I had the pan blacken foie gras. . . . which was a bit also gelatinous for my liking ( have had way better ). . . . the waffles were a nice contact. It reminds me of a restaurant in Paris that practice to serve foie gras with ginger bread. . . . rather nice. . . . the sweet and salty combo always works marvel. My wife ordered the Chevre walnut tarte. . . . one piece of advice. . . . stay the netherworld away from it. Its mainly a medley of thick , sandy crust and walnut powder , with ABSOLUTELY NO DETECTABLE trace amounts of butt cheese. . . . . For 11 , it was an downright rip off. The host initially did n't react when we told him that this dish was absolutely not a success. . . . however , he did later carry it off the bill. My wife just had a really unlucky eventide. make up vegetarian , she ordered the Vegetarian Trilogy. What this ended up being was a soggy vegetable lasagna , served with a supposed macademia truffle sauce that try out more like peanut butter , except that it was even more bland and greasy. . . . . The truffle scented gnoccis that we ordered as a side dish , looked like , and savor like stale , soggy , greasy fries. . . . yuck. I even so ordered the diver 's scallops and lobster , which was pretty good. Not the softest lobster , but damn tasty , and the scallops were double dyed , and huuuge. No dessert , as we were pretty repel with the whole experience. Netnet : expensive place , crap value for money , food is altogether hit and miss , but the view is nice , if they can deign paying attention to the service they provide. . . . ", "label": 1}

We should have waved a 100 bill at Bai as we passed leaving the area , because that is what he miss his restaurant that evening , not to mention this AWESOME review. ", "label": 1}

The beef in the number five was perfect, sliced thin and rare when it was put in so that the broth could cook it. The broth wasn't overly oily and you get a big plate of'fixing's (like bean sprouts, lime and basil) for your soup. Overall, this place was greatthough I think the soup needs more meat on average.

{"original_text": "I came here during the Mtl a table festival, a festival that allows foodies to try out new restaurants at a fraction of the price. I was looking forward to this since I've been here before but only to have a drink. I started out with the bison tartare which was very tasty. It's after that that things started to deteriorate. We waited 45 minutes for our main course and when I spotted the waitress with our dishes I said to my friend that we're finally going to eat. Since she was facing the kitchen she said that she hoped not since those plates have been sitting next to the bar for quite a while. Sure enough, those were our plates. My osso bucco was still warm, but she said that her fish was a bit cold. Because we were so famished she didn't say anything. Speaking of my osso bucco, it was bland. There was no seasoning at all. Disappointing. I was really looking forward to the dessert since I love anything sweet. My pudding chomeur consisted of a dry white cake with caramel on top. The cake was so dry that the caramel couldn't even moisten it, which is what it's supposed to do. I've had a better pudding chomeur at rotisserie St-Hubert. Because this was during the Mtl a table festival, I paid a set price of 39 for my food. At that price, I felt that it was slightly overpriced for what I got. However had I went any other time, the same meal would've cost me 54?! That's just insane. There are better and cheaper options nearby. Another thing; there are a couple of reviews that mention the loudness of the music. I have to agree with them. Is it necessary to blast music at 6pm?

I'll tell you now...it's no Arlecchino, but the quality of the gelato is better than the one just down the road from this place. The shop is brand-spanking new, almost clinical-looking, with it's white walls, streamlined lighting, and minimal furnishings (mostly Ikea-looking).The interior is simply non-descript, almost too bland and boring-looking. But perhaps there was a reasoning behind the seemingly sterilized, minimalist environment...ah, yes, of course. The element that seems to give the room character and subtle vibrancy is the gelato. The flavor selection is pretty impressive...almost Baskin Robbins-esque, with its 31 flavors (or maybe more!). The consistency of the gelato is excellent, very creamy and it doesn't leave you with a gritty feeling in your mouth. As far as flavors go, I think the fruitier ones win over the chocolate, or cream-based flavors. For example, their rum raisin just lacked the punch of rum, and their cherry vanilla really was just vanilla with chunks of frozen cherry. If you were only served one chunk of cherry, then expect to be eating vanilla gelato the rest of the time. In contrast, their mango and raspberry, for example, had just the right tartness that made you pucker with delight. The fruity flavors were true to taste and were magnificent when combined. I say, go for the fruit flavors! The staff members were very friendly and courteous, and were very generous in giving you sample tastings.

Capital Brewery makes consistently high-quality German lagers (with a few good ales thrown in for good measure), and provides a low-key, no-frills environment that can be whatever you want it to be. The beer garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun.

Bring your own food - some local joints like the Roman Candle will even deliver right to your picnic table.
