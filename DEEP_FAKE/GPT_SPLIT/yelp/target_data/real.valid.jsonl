{"original_text": "le sigh I really didn't want it to come to this because well, as a vegan there are very few places I can go to eat, but after disappointment after disappointment I'm sorry to say I will not be coming back to Pura Vida any time soon. This was my letter to Chef Mayra after the Titanic x Hindenburg disaster that was their Valentine's Day dinner. I hate to say it but I am livid and a bit appalled after tonight's Valentine's dinner. We paid 75 for 15 courses; you gave up after 12, and a couple of the courses were thrown plated together last minute instead of being the separate courses they were advertised as. When you pay for something, you should receive it. Not only were we denied the extra courses, but it took forever to get them - you asked us to come early and that dinner would be served 6-9 PM; the first course wasn't even served until 6:40 PM. We left at 10 PM (we had plans at 9:30 - oh well!) confused as to where the rest of the courses were. There was very little explanation or communication and definitely poor planning. As a vegan I was excited for this opportunity and have eaten at your establishment many times, as well as referred you to others, but this will most likely be my last time. My husband really wanted this year to be special, but it was a huge headache. If you do this next year I hope you severely edit the menu and the prices so everyone leaves satisfied and at the designated time. You knew how many people were coming well in advance and should have had a test run of some sort. The only semblance of apology came from your servers when the food was not being served in the beginning. My husband is now even complaining he's still hungry as we didn't eat earlier in the day to fit this event in! This is one of the worst of not the absolute worst restaurant experiences I have ever been privy to and I hope to never repeat this episode of Vegan Survivor ever again. I appreciate that everything is made ready-to-order, but when you're serving FIFTEEN courses to 40 guests who you asked to arrive early and did actually have a definitive ending time of 9 PM, you have to make sure it goes smoothly which it did not. My husband and I were starved for over an hour before the food started coming. We estimated our time of exit by how quickly the food was coming out and it should have ended past midnight! Completely awful. A bunch of people left (and I wish I were one of them), and I'm pretty sure every single person left unsatisfied. This establishment has absolutely 0 business acumen and it is going to hurt them. You don't even have to watch a couple episodes of Kitchen Nightmares to realize Pura Vida is doing it wrong. If you have to come out and explain every menu item as well as feel the need to put pictures of the food in the convoluted menu, as a diner you should run immediately.

This was my letter to Chef Mayra after the Titanic x Hindenburg calamity that was their Valentine 's Day dinner. I hate to read it but I am livid and a bit appalled after tonight 's Valentine 's dinner. We paid 75 for 15 courses ; you gave up after 12 , and a couple of the courses were thrown plate together last minute instead of being the separate courses they were advertised as. When you pay for something , you should receive it. Not only were we denied the extra courses , but it took forever to get them - you asked us to come early and that dinner party would be served 6-9 PM ; the first course was n't even served until 6:40 PM. We left at 10 PM ( we had plans at 9:30 - oh well ! ) fox as to where the rest of the courses were. There was very little explanation or communication and by all odds poor planning. As a vegan I was excited for this opportunity and have eaten at your governing body many times , as well as referred you to others , but this will most likely be my last time. My husband real wanted this year to be special , but it was a huge headache. If you do this next year I hope you severely edit the menu and the terms so everyone leaves satisfied and at the designated time. You knew how many people were coming advantageously in advance and should have had a test run of some sort. The only semblance of apology issue forth from your servers when the food was not being served in the beginning. My husband is now even complaining he 's still hungry as we did n't eat earlier in the day to fit this event in ! This is one of the worst of not the absolute worst eating place experiences I have ever been privy to and I hope to never repeat this episode of Vegan Survivor ever again. I appreciate that everything is made ready-to-order , but when you 're process FIFTEEN courses to 40 guests who you asked to arrive early and did actually have a definitive ending time of 9 PM , you have to make sure it goes smoothly which it did not. My husband and I were starved for over an hour before the food pop out coming. We estimated our metre of exit by how quickly the food was coming out and it should have ended past midnight ! Completely awful. A bunch of people left ( and I like I were one of them ) , and I 'm pretty sure every single person left unsatisfied.

On a frigid November evening, you'd think that'd be wonderful, but it was SO HOT. I literally felt as if I was getting a sunburn, and coats facing the fire were untouchably hot. It was so profoundly uncomfortable, even after we asked them to turn the fireplace down (they wouldn't turn it all the way off). The table for 7 was not meant to hold that many, and once our appetizers and drinks arrived we were forced to hold the bulky menus in our laps because there was no longer anywhere to set them down. The appetizers were ok in taste but lacking in critical elements they advertized. The truffle fries needed more truffle oil or a better dip. There was no gravy on the poutine (I don't even know how it's called poutine without it, but I digress), but instead an oily poutine sauce that didn't seem to have a flavor - it just seemed like curds and fries in extra oil.

My coworker quickly recommended New Horizon's because they have tons of offices in the valley and there would likely be one close to me (or work). They were the only place that also agreed to perform the test I needed without first doing a regular consultation (I had already seen a doctor and just needed a follow up test). I arrived 30mins before my appointment time so I could fill out paperwork and do all the homework prior to seeing the Dr. The office is very large and quite pretty with lots of chairs, TVs and magazines. That's really the only positive. I filled out a bible's worth of paperwork (more than any other place) and gave them my IDinsurance card to check and photocopy. When I went to the bathroom I saw a sign that I needed to give a urine test for my procedure.... as I am sitting on the toilet. WTF? Why would they not tell me this when I booked the appointment? Or when they gave me the 2-day reminder? Or maybe even when I checked in and told them what I was there for?.

Gross, I really hope that nurse doesn't tip it over and drop it accidentally. After all that mess, it was time for my appointment but I was still waiting outside, holding my pager like a customer at Outback Stakehouse. They didn't take me in until 30-40mins later, and that was just with the nurse telling me what was going to happen. I waited in the consultation room, got moved to a second consultation room and then waited some more for the doctor.
