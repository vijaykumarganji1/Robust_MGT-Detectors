The US military took this requirement very seriously, burying the body within hours. \"Traditional procedures for Islamic burial were followed,\" an official said. Religious rites were carried out on the deck of a US aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson. The body, shrouded in a white sheet and placed in a weighted bag, was then positioned on a flat board, tipped up, and eased into the Arabian Sea. This occurred at 0600GMT, approximately 12 hours after the firefight during which Osama Bin Laden was shot in the head. After this first shot, reports ABC News' The Blotter, he was shot again, to make sure that he was dead. The body was then flown to Afghanistan and Bin Laden's identity was confirmed. Officials say a DNA sample was taken that matched that of several other family members. Some sources say facial recognition technology was also used. From Afghanistan, the body was, it appears, flown to the USS Carl Vinson. \"A military officer read prepared religious remarks, which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker,\" a US defence official said. According to UK-based Imam Dr Abduljalil Sajid, Chairman of the Muslim Council for Religious Racial Harmony, four key steps need to be followed: There is no necessity for an imam to be present, he says, but the procedures should be carried out by Muslims at least one of whom \"knows the minimum basic Muslim law of burial.\" Whether any such person was present is impossible to know, he says, based on the limited information provided. But he also questions whether sea burial was appropriate in this case. It is correct to carry out a burial at sea when someone dies on a sea journey, he says, but in this case there was no sound reason for it. The US authorities could surely have found someone - a member of the extensive Bin Laden family, or even one of the many supporters of his \"evil\" ideology - who would have been prepared to give the body a proper burial, he argues. His words were echoed by Mohammed Qudah, a professor of Islamic law at the University of Jordan, who told the Associated Press news agency that burying Bin Laden at sea was not forbidden if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial. But he went on: \"It's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive Bin Laden's body.\" The agency also quoted Dubai's grand mufti Mohammed al-Qubaisi, saying that sea burials were permissible only in extraordinary circumstances, adding: \"This is not one of them.\" \"If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: You dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it,\" he said.

They are six points off the Premier League summit after losing two consecutive home league matches for the first time since December 2008, and have lost ground to Arsenal and Tottenham, who are in third and second respectively. City know the gap is not insurmountable, having been eight points behind Manchester United in April 2012 before snatching the Premier League title on the final day. But they are 11 points worse off than Leicester and Tottenham during this 17-game period and need to find form quickly. City will point towards the penalty as a key moment against a Tottenham side who have not won a top-flight title since 1961.

Media playback is not supported on this device Manchester City were absolutely furious at Mark Clattenburg's decision to penalise Sterling and you could understand why. The England forward had turned his back as he jumped to block Danny Rose's cross, with the ball hitting him as he was looking the other way. Former Wales and Leicester midfielder Robbie Savage told BBC Radio 5 live: \"I think that is harsh, very, very harsh. It has hit him on the elbow.\" However, in a match of few chances, City should ask questions defensively as they levelled before leaving themselves wide open seven minutes from time for Eriksen, on his 24th birthday, to win the match. England manager Roy Hodgson was at the Etihad and would have welcomed the earlier news of scoring returns for Arsenal's Danny Welbeck and Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge. In the first two games of the day, six of the nine goals scored had been netted by English players and his options before Euro 2016 were further demonstrated in Manchester as Kane scored his 16th Premier League goal of the season. The 11.9km covered by England's 19-year-old midfielder Dele Alli was more than all but one of Manchester City's side, as he continues to impress, while compatriot Eric Dier, 22, was solid in the holding midfield role. Another England forward, Sterling, was quiet for the most part for City, although he did almost break the deadlock with a volley that was bravely blocked by Rose early on. Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini told BBC Sport: \"It was a penalty that referee Mark Clattenburg wanted to sign for and he gave the sign. It was absolutely the wrong decision, it hit the back of Raheem Sterling then his elbow. Sterling was not even seeing the ball. It was the same referee in the first game where there were two clear goals in offside and we lost 4-1. \"It was the key moment that decided thee game; before that they did not shoot towards our goal and did not have any chances.

The court hearing was told that on 9 October, 2013, a car driven by Gavin Hughes was stopped in north Belfast, and when the vehicle was stopped a black plastic bag was located on the passenger seat. The bag contained five compact cubes of cocaine which amounted to 1.27 kilos of the Class A drug.

{"original_text": "Dubbed \"carbon farming,\" researchers say the idea is economically competitive with high-tech carbon capture and storage projects. But critics say the idea could be have unforeseen, negative impacts including driving up food prices. The research has been published in the journal Earth System Dynamics. Jatropha curcas is a plant that originated in Central America and is very well adapted to harsh conditions including extremely arid deserts. It is already grown as a biofuel in some parts of the world because its seeds can produce oil. In this study, German scientists showed that one hectare of jatropha could capture up to 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. The researchers based their estimates on trees currently growing in trial plots in Egypt and in the Negev desert. \"The results are overwhelming,\" said Prof Klaus Becker, from the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart. \"There was good growth, a good response from these plants. I feel there will be no problem trying it on a much larger scale, for example ten thousand hectares in the beginning,\" he said. According to the researchers a plantation that would cover three percent of the Arabian desert would absorb all the CO2 produced by cars and trucks in Germany over a 20 year period. The scientists say that a critical element of the plan would be the availability of desalination facilities. This means that initially, any plantations would be confined to coastal areas. They are hoping to develop larger trials in desert areas of Oman or Qatar. Prof Becker says that unlike other schemes that just offset the carbon that people produce, the planting of jatropha could be a good, short term solution to climate change. \"I think it is a good idea because we are really extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - and it is completely different between extracting and preventing.\" According to the scientist's calculations the costs of curbing carbon dioxide via the planting of trees would be between 42 and 63 euros per tonne. This makes it competitive with other techniques, such as the more high tech carbon capture and storage (CCS). A number of countries are currently trialling this technology but it has yet to be deployed commercially. Growing jatropha not only soaks up CO2 but has other benefits. The plants would help to make desert areas more habitable, and the plant's seeds can be harvested for biofuel say the researchers, providing an economic return. \"Jatropha is ideal to be turned into biokerosene - it is even better than biodiesel,\" said Prof Becker. But other experts in this area are not convinced. They point to the fact that in 2007 and 2008 large numbers of jatropha trees were planted for biofuel, especially in Africa. But many of these ventures ended in tears, as the plants were not very successful in coping with dry conditions. Lucy Hurn is the biofuels campaign manager for the charity, Actionaid. She says that while jatropha was once seen as the great, green hope the reality was very different. \"When jatropha was introduced it was seen as a miracle crop, it would grow on scrubland or marginal land,\" she said. \"But there are often people who need marginal land to graze their animals, they are getting food from that area - we wouldn't class the land as marginal.\" She pointed out that jatropha is highly toxic and can pollute the land it is grown on, even in a desert. And she also had concerns about the fairness of the idea. \"It is still somebody else's land.

{"original_text": "Philae, the first spacecraft to land on a comet, was dropped on to the surface of Comet 67P by its mothership, Rosetta, last November. It worked for 60 hours before its solar-powered battery ran flat. The comet has since moved nearer to the Sun and Philae has enough power to work again, says the BBC's science correspondent Jonathan Amos. An account linked to the probe tweeted the message, \"Hello Earth! Can you hear me?\" On its blog, Esa said Philae had contacted Earth, via Rosetta, for 85 seconds on Saturday in the first contact since going into hibernation in November. \"Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35C and has 24 watts available,\" said Philae project manager, Dr Stephan Ulamec. Scientists say they now waiting for the next contact. Esa's senior scientific advisor, Prof Mark McCaughrean, told the BBC: \"It's been a long seven months, and to be quite honest we weren't sure it would happen - there are a lot of very happy people around Europe at the moment.\" Philae was carrying large amounts of data that scientists hoped to download once it made contact again, he said. \"I think we're optimistic now that it's awake that we'll have several months of scientific data to pore over,\" he added. This is one of the most astonishing moments in space exploration and the grins on the faces of the scientists and engineers are totally justified, says BBC science editor David Shukman. For the first time, we will have a hitchhiker riding on a comet and describing what happens to a comet as it heats up on its journey through space, he adds. Philae is designed to analyse the ice and rocky fragments that make up the comet. Prof Monica Grady from the Open University told the BBC that scientists now hoped to be able to carry out experiments to see whether comets were the source of life on Earth. Comets contained a lot of water and carbon, and \"these are the same sorts of molecules responsible for getting life going,\" she said. \"What we're trying to find out is whether the building blocks of life, in terms of water and carbon-bearing molecules, were actually delivered to Earth from comets.\" When Philae first sent back images of its landing location, researchers could see it was in a dark ditch. The Sun was obscured by a high wall, limiting the amount of light that could reach the robot's solar panels. Scientists knew they only had a limited amount of time - about 60 hours - to gather data before the robot's battery ran flat. But the calculations also indicated that Philae's mission might not be over for good when the juice did eventually run dry. The comet is currently moving in towards the Sun, and the intensity of light falling on Philae, engineers suggested, could be sufficient in time to re-boot the machine. And so it has proved. Scientists must now hope they can get enough power into Philae to carry out a full range of experiments. One ambition not fulfilled before the robot went to sleep was to try to drill into the comet, to examine its chemical make-up. One attempt was made last year, and it failed. A second attempt will now become a priority. Return of the plucky robot Philae's extraordinary opportunity Rosetta: The whole story The Rosetta probe took 10 years to reach 67P, and the lander - about the size of a washing-machine - bounced at least a kilometre when it touched down. Before it lost power, Philae sent back images of its surroundings that showed it was in a dark location with high walls blocking sunlight from reaching its solar panels. Its exact location on the duck-shaped comet has since been a mystery. Esa had a good idea of where it was likely to be, down to a few tens of metres, but could not get Rosetta close enough to the comet to acquire conclusive pictures. Continued radio contact should now allow precise coordinates to be determined, correspondents say. Comet 67P is currently 205 million km (127 million miles) from the Sun, and getting closer. It is due in August to get as close as 186 million km, before then sweeping back out into the outer Solar System. As it nears the sun, the comet will warm and its ices will melt.

Rachel Williams from Newport, who suffered 18 years of domestic violence at the hands of her late husband, Darren Williams, said: \"If you don't deal with the perpetrator, who's the problem, all they'll do is go on to the next victim.\" In 2011, after Ms Williams filed for divorce, her husband burst into her hair salon armed with a sawn-off shotgun and shot her in the leg, before hanging himself in woodland. Six weeks later, as she was recovering in hospital, the body of her 16-year-old son, Jack, was found hanged in the same spot. Ms Williams, 44, who has since remarried, said her former husband would have benefited from the scheme. \"He was a control freak and he needed his actions addressing,\" she said. \"We've got to try and change the mindset of the perpetrator and hold them accountable for their actions.\" One woman who survived a \"hellish five-year marriage to a physically, emotionally and financially abusive man\" said she did not believe the Drive scheme would be effective and it would be better to spend the money on support for victims. \"The majority - although not all - of serial perpetrators of domestic violence do it out of choice, not because they have drug, alcohol, social or financial problems,\" she said. \"They will use this Drive scheme as a way to avoid prison and they will deliberately make it look as though they are reforming until they are'signed off' and deemed safe. \"They will then simply find another victim and go back to how they were.\" Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said there was \"no evidence - here or abroad - that therapy programmes for violent partners work.\" She added: \"On the face of it, it seems like a worthy thing to do.

They only have PS34 million from the government, which is static and won't go up,\" she said. \"We told them right at the beginning, this was never going to be a commercially viable project - but nobody listened to us.\" BBC Radio Bristol politics reporter Pete Simson Could Bristol really be left with a brand new public transport network, but no company willing to run it? The idea was always for Metrobus to be run without subsidies, using shiny new buses with clean fuel. Unfortunately, it would appear bus companies view this as simply too risky, after all, they want to make a profit. With huge swathes of Bristol's roads currently being dug up to build Metrobus, the need for a deal becomes ever more pressing. Time will tell if this is merely another teething problem, or a hugely costly mistake. Commuters are currently enduring roadworks associated with the scheme in the city centre, on the M32 and various other locations in South Gloucestershire. The scheme was devised by the West of England Partnership (WEP), an alliance between the four councils in Bristol, Bath, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset. It involves three routes: Ashton Vale to Temple Meads, Cribbs Causeway via Emersons Green to the city centre and the South Bristol link between the A370 Long Ashton bypass and Hengrove Park. It will provide an express bus service on 31 miles (50km) of segregated bus-ways and bus lanes. The WEP said Bristol, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset council were \"actively negotiating\" with bus operators and such discussions were commercially sensitive. A spokeswoman said: \"We have always been clear that the aim is that the MetroBus services are run entirely on a commercial basis via a quality partnership scheme that sets minimum standards for frequencies, quality of vehicles and maximum fares, supported by a voluntary partnership agreement with one or more operator. \"Of course should negotiations not be successful, we have a range of back up plans which could include formal contracts to run all or some services on a contracted basis. \"This might require the use of public money following a competitive procurement process, but this would depend on the situation when negotiations conclude - which all parties agree should be in about three-four weeks' time.\" First Bus, Wessex and the Bath Bus Company RAPT were said to be in the running for the contract.", "text_perturb": "Negotiations over who will run the PS200m Metrobus network have stalled as bus companies are loath to run the service on a completely commercial basis.

He was one of the most colourful characters in the British game and has since enjoyed success at Inter Milan and Real Madrid before returning to London. BBC Sport looks at some of Mourinho's best quotes and controversies. On becoming Chelsea manager for the first time: \"I have top players and I'm sorry, we have a top manager. Please do not call me arrogant because what I say is true. I'm European champion, I'm not one out of the bottle, I think I'm a special one.\" On bird flu: \"I'm feeling a lot of pressure with the swan in Scotland. It's not far and I'm more scared of the swan than of football. What's football compared to life? A swan with bird flu, for me that's a drama.\" On drinking wine with then-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: \"After the game, after the press conference, we were together in my office. The wine we were drinking was very bad and he was complaining. When we go to Old Trafford it's my birthday and I will go with a beautiful bottle of Portuguese wine.\" Media playback is not supported on this device On eggs: \"Omelettes, eggs. No eggs, no omelettes. And it depends on the quality of the eggs in the supermarket. They are class one, two or three and some are more expensive than others and some give you better omelettes. When the class one eggs are not available you have a problem.\" On being sacked: \"If the club decide to sack me because of bad results that's part of the game. If it happens I will be a millionaire and get another club a couple of months later.\" On Chelsea's pitch: \"Sometimes you see beautiful people with no brains. Sometimes you have ugly people who are intelligent, like scientists. Our pitch is a bit like that. From the top it's a disgrace but the ball rolls at normal speed.\" On playing Chelsea, while manager of Real Madrid: \"If I play them in the Champions League, I want to go there and kill them - that's my message,\" Then-Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez: \"If Chelsea are naive and pure then I'm Little Red Riding Hood.\" Then-Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock: \"My wife will be glad about Mourinho coming to Bramall Lane because he's a good looking swine, isn't he?\" Career record up to 1 June 2013 Former Chelsea striker Eidur Gudjohnsen: \"When Mourinho says training will last one-and-a-half hours it will never last a second longer.\" Then-Chelsea striker Didier Drogba's reaction to Mourinho leaving the London club: \"I find Jose's'eviction' hard to take. I could not see the blow coming so brutally. \"It changes an awful lot of things. I am in the sort of nervous state I've never dreamed about before. Many of us used to play first and foremost for the manager. Now we need to forget those feelings and find another source of motivation.\" Ian Holloway on Mourinho's sacking by Chelsea: \"Football has gone mad. He is one of the best managers in the world. I'm devastated. I was learning from him from afar. He makes you feel 25-foot tall and I'm going to sorely miss him.\" Barcelona vice-president Carles Vilarrubi on Mourinho's return to Chelsea: \"It is not good for English football. If Mourinho behaves like he did in Spain it will only be an unhappy relationship. In his three years in Spain he only created disagreements and arguments. I am happy he is leaving and so is everyone in Spanish football.\" February 2005: After Chelsea's 2-1 defeat against Barcelona in the first leg of their last-16 clash, Mourinho wrongly accused Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard of visiting referee Anders Frisk at half-time. Mourinho is fined PS8,900, given a two-match touchline ban and called an \"enemy of football\" by the head of Uefa's referees committee Volker Roth. March 2005: Mourinho is fined PS5,000 after he alleged Manchester United players were guilty of \"fault and fault and cheat and cheat\" during a Carling Cup semi-final clash. June 2005: Mourinho is fined PS200,000, which is reduced to PS75,000 on appeal, for meeting then-Arsenal player Ashley Cole, without his club's consent. January to March 2010: While manager of Inter Milan, Mourinho is fined three times in as many months by the Italian Football Federation.

{"original_text": "Even with the usual caveats attached to opinion polls, a 65 to 17 majority for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK suggests little room for doubt. The British and Irish governments have both made it clear they don't think now is the time to hold a border poll. Sinn Fein are campaigning for a poll and the DUP have discussed, in their words, calling Sinn Fein's bluff. But after weeks of controversy about flags and national identity, politicians' claims about Catholic unionism, and a census showing a growing number identifying themselves as Northern Irish, what lies behind that headline figure in the Spotlight opinion poll is particularly revealing. Not surprisingly, more than 90 of those who identify themselves as Protestants told the pollsters they wanted to stay in the UK. But on the other side of the religious divide, a substantial 38 of Catholics also favoured remaining within the UK - three percentage points more than the number who backed a united Ireland. While only 5 of Protestants don't intend to vote or haven't decided which option they would pick, more than a quarter of Catholics are either undecided or not planning on voting. As avowed believers in a united Ireland and the party running a border poll campaign, Sinn Fein might be surprised to learn that nearly a quarter of those who identified themselves as Sinn Fein voters - 23 - told the pollsters they would back the status quo in a border poll. More than half of SDLP supporters - 56 - also said they would opt to stay in the UK if a poll was held tomorrow. Prime Minister David Cameron said the survey for the BBC Spotlight programme on the potential outcome of a border poll should lift the spirits of all those who value Northern Ireland's place within the union. The results of the 2011 census, released in December last year, revealed that just over a fifth of the population considers itself \"Northern Irish.\" That posed a political puzzle - in a border poll would these people tick a British or an Irish box? Well, those who identified themselves as \"Northern Irish\" for the BBC Spotlight poll back staying in the UK by a significant margin - 72 to just 7. At the DUP conference late last year Peter Robinson hinted that his party hopes to make inroads into Catholic unionist territory. Since then commentators have expressed the view that the union flag dispute and the ensuing protests make this a pipe dream. The Spotlight survey suggests the main parties have a long way to go to reach across the religious divide. Those identifying themselves as DUP supporters are 97 Protestant, while UUP supporters are 99 Protestant. Those backing Sinn Fein are 99 Catholic, while SDLP supporters are 92 Catholic. Alliance, as an identifiably centre ground party, is the one bucking the trend - with 51 Protestant backing and 36 Catholic support. Alliance's support for a \"designated days\" flag flying policy at Belfast City Hall stirred controversy and led to attacks on the party's offices and a death threat against its only MP, Naomi Long. However the Spotlight poll suggests raising the flag on 18 designated days is the most popular compromise across the community as a whole. Of those interviewed, 44 backed the designated days policy, in comparison to 35 wanting the union flag raised throughout the year. A further 10 told the pollsters no flag should be flown at the City Hall, while only 2 opted for the union flag flying alongside the Irish tricolour. Although designated days was the most popular option, flag flying polarises unionists and nationalists. 73 of unionists want the union flag up at Belfast City Hall 365 days a year, while 64 of nationalists support the 18 day policy. Even though the designated days compromise got more support than any other option, just over half of those interviewed thought the union flag protestors were right to take to the streets when Belfast City Council made its decision in early December. This result may reflect some people's belief in the right to protest, even if they don't back the aim of a particular demonstration. However this support appears to have dwindled sharply during the course of January, as by the time the Spotlight survey was carried out more than three quarters of interviewees wanted the protests to stop. They told the pollsters this was for a variety of reasons, the main ones being the violence sparked by some protests and the disruptive impact on business.

{"original_text": "It may be their signature pose, but how and why the birds perch on one limb has been a longstanding puzzle. Now, a team from the US has shown that flamingos employ no active muscular effort when they're unipedal, meaning they are also expending less energy. A passive mechanism is engaged in the one-legged position, allowing flamingos to stand proud while having a doze. Previously, researchers had wondered whether the one-legged position might help reduce muscle fatigue, as the birds alternated from standing on one leg to the other. Other teams have proposed that this behaviour helps regulate body temperature. Now, Prof Young-Hui Chang, from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) in Atlanta, and Lena H Ting, of Atlanta's Emory University, have uncovered the mechanical secrets behind this impressive trick. The researchers conducted several experiments with both live and dead birds. Amazingly, they found that flamingo cadavers could be made to stand one-legged without any external support. In a paper published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, they describe this phenomenon as a \"passive gravitational stay mechanism.\" \"If you look at the bird from the front, while they're standing on one leg, the foot is directly beneath the body which means that their leg is angled inward. That's the pose you have to strike in order to engage the stay mechanism,\" Prof Chang told BBC News. However, dead birds cannot stand unsupported on two legs, suggesting a greater role for active muscle force in this posture: \"If you tilt it to the vertical, like you would if you were standing on two legs, the whole thing disengages,\" said the director of the Comparative Neuromechanics Laboratory at Georgia Tech. The researchers also studied live birds, and showed that when they were standing one-legged and resting, they hardly moved at all - underlining the stability of this passive position. However, the birds did sway somewhat when the one-legged posture was combined with an activity, such as grooming or calling out. Prof Chang said the underlying anatomical apparatus that enables the passive posture was not yet understood - this is the next step in the team's research. But he explained that the phenomenon did not involve the limb joints locking. \"A lock would imply that it's fixed in both directions. What we found is that it's fixed in one direction, but flexible in the other direction, so we call it a'stay' rather than a'lock'. It's more akin to a doorstop,\" he told me. Dr Matthew Anderson, an experimental psychologist who specialises in animal behaviour at St Joseph's University in Philadelphia, described the team's results as a \"significant step forward.\" The researcher, who was not involved with the latest study, added: \"They begin to answer the question of how flamingos are able to rest on one leg. Importantly, these authors do not examine when and where flamingos actually utilise the behaviour in question, and thus this paper does not really address the issue of why flamingos rest while on one leg.\" Dr Anderson's own research suggests that the birds adopt the unusual posture in order to conserve heat.

{"original_text": "The former Huddersfield and Birmingham manager will need to hit the ground running at Rugby Park, with the team just one point above the relegation play-off place. And his old team-mate Alex Rae - the St Mirren manager - reckons the Killie board have chosen wisely. \"I think he will be a very good addition to Scottish football,\" Rae told BBC Scotland. \"I knew him from playing against him, and he became a team-mate in 1997 when he joined Sunderland. \"Lee has been around a long, long time now as a player and in the coaching and management side of things.\" Kilmarnock can certainly expect to see a manager who wears his heart on his sleeve. \"The one thing about Lee Clark is you definitely see his passion, you see him running up and down the touchline,\" added Rae. \"The board will be looking for a little bit of a bounce, they will be hoping they can continue the form from the last couple of games where they have drawn with Rangers and got a really good result at the weekend [a 2-0 victory at Motherwell].\" \"He will be going into a dressing room that will be a wee bit encouraged.\" The undoubted highlight of Clark's managerial story thus far was his first job. It ran from 2008 to 2012 following coaching spells at Newcastle United and Norwich City. For a while he was a huge prospect down south, famously taking League One Huddersfield on a 43-match unbeaten run. Backed by chairman Dean Hoyle, the remit for Clark was to take The Terriers into the Championship. Twice they made the play-offs. Twice they failed to go up. Eventually patience ran out and in February 2012 Clark was sacked following a 1-0 defeat to Sheffield United - a decision that looked harsh considering Clark had only lost three of his previous 55 league matches to that point. Hoyle wanted promotion and got it, with Clark's replacement, Simon Grayson, delivering via the play-offs. One of Clark's last signings for Huddersfield was Kallum Higginbotham - a player he will be reunited with at Kilmarnock. Clark would graduate to the Championship with Birmingham City but it was a time of turmoil at the club. Twice he preserved their status in the division, albeit survival in the 2013-14 season was secured by the tightest of margins - an injury-time goal from former Celtic player Paul Caddis keeping them up on goal difference. But a poor start to the following season saw Clark sacked in October 2014. His last managerial stint was an unhappy one as he immediately moved to Blackpool, who were bottom of the Championship. Relegation followed and he resigned in May 2015. Rae thinks it would be wrong to read too much into this dismal spell at the Seasiders. \"The one thing about working for Blackpool - I was there as well - it is a really tough, tough environment to work in,\" he said. \"The downsizing in terms of the playing budget almost made it impossible to succeed there. I would not judge Lee on that last tenure.\" The Killie board clearly like what they see in Clark but he is entering an environment he has little experience of. The 43-year-old is joining a club where money is tight and this will present challenges. He will need to be resourceful to make changes. There is precious little breathing space at the foot of the Premiership and the stakes are high for a club that could certainly do without enduring the financial hardship relegation would bring. 'Big prospect' is a tag that has hung around Clark both as player and boss. That is no longer the case and there is a sense of unrealised potential. But there is clearly a hunger to succeed as well. Kilmarnock may not be a final throw of the dice for Clark but there are only so many chances for managers in a highly competitive marketplace. As a youngster Clark was an exciting talent with the club he loved, Newcastle United. He represented England at schoolboy and at under-21 level. He enjoyed a very successful career - twice finishing as a Premier League runner-up with the Magpies and also played in the top flight with Fulham. Lee McCulloch and Peter Leven are staying on as Killie coaches and Rae thinks Clark will rely heavily on his new Scottish lieutenants. \"These boys know the personnel and also the division,\" explained Rae. \"The one thing about Lee is he is a motivator.

The American regains the number one ranking from German Angelique Kerber. Australia's Margaret Court, with 24, is the only player still ahead of Serena in terms of Grand Slam singles titles. \"Congratulations Serena on number 23,\" said Venus, who at 36 is the oldest Australian Open finalist in the Open era. \"I have been right there with you, some of them I lost right there against you. It's been an awesome win. \"I'm enormously proud of you, you mean the world to me. I, God willing, would love to come back. Thank you for all the love.\" Serena paid tribute to her sister, who was playing her first major final for eight years, saying: \"There's no way I would be at 23 without her. There's no way I'd be at one without her. She's my inspiration. \"She's the only reason I'm standing here today. She's the only reason the Williams sisters exist. Thank you for inspiring me. Every time you won this week, I felt like I got a win too.\" Serena went into the match as a strong favourite, but the tension was apparent as early as the third game when she smashed a racquet in frustration, receiving a code violation. She had broken serve in the first and third games only to hand the advantage straight back each time, three double faults inexplicably littering a desperate game for 2-2. It was clear the six-time champion was struggling to settle, with 13 unforced errors in the opening five games, while elder sister Venus kept her under pressure with some deep hitting. The decisive move of the set came with a superb drop volley followed by a thumping forehand winner from Serena to break for 4-3, and this time she managed to consolidate on serve. In contrast to the opening stages, the following nine games went with serve - Venus recovering superbly from 0-40 early in the second set - but it was Serena who was creating the chances. She finally capitalised on her sixth break point of the set with a brilliant return to lead 4-3 and followed it up with her best service game of the match for 5-3. The crowd on Rod Laver Arena had been backing Venus from the beginning as she tried to win a first major title for eight years, and all the more so as defeat loomed and she appeared to struggle physically. There was a huge cheer when she held serve to force her sister to serve out the match, but Serena recovered from 15-30 to earn match point and fell back on the court in celebration as her sister sent the ball floating wide. Saturday's final was the 28th instalment of the sisters' on-court rivarly, which began at the Australian Open back in 1998, with Serena now 17-11 ahead and 7-2 up in Grand Slam finals. Venus, who turned professional in 1994 and has won five Wimbledon and two US Open titles, insisted she was not too disappointed after reaching her first major final since 2009. \"No, because I guess I've been here before, \"she said. \"I really enjoy seeing the name'Williams' on the trophy. This is a beautiful thing.\" Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent: Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Serena Williams is the length of time she has been winning Grand Slam titles. The first came on 11 September 1999 in New York; the 23rd on 28 January 2017 here in Melbourne. The match itself will quickly be forgotten; but never the achievement. Richard Williams used to beg tennis clubs to part with their old balls when he started to put his daughters through their paces in the Los Angeles district of Compton, and now Serena has more Grand Slam singles titles than anyone who has ever played the game, with the exception of Margaret Court. Williams is now just one behind the Australian - who was watching on the Rod Laver Arena - and in the view of the 18-time Grand Slam champion Martina Navratilova, it is a record she could \"shatter\" before her playing days are done.

But politics is about expectations. At one point a rumour swept the gathering that he'd lost more than a third of his alliance's seats in the Knesset - in the end the exit polls suggested it would be more like a quarter. Cue wild celebration. If you add together Mr Netanyahu's natural allies among the religious parties and the rest of the right - and assume he'll be able to attract at least one party from the centre or even the left - then he should be able to form a government again.

He emerges from these elections a rather diminished figure, whose wheeling and dealing skills may be sorely tested as he sets about building a new coalition. When he spoke to a crowd of activists in Tel Aviv he was measured, although it took him some time to persuade his supporters to stop celebrating long enough to make himself heard. \"I am going to seek as broad a government as possible,\" he said. \" I'm going to seek out many partners.\" That was perhaps his way of acknowledging that the overall results of the night were curiously ambiguous. To the left of Mr Netanyahu, Labour picked up seats but to the right of him so did Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home party) led by his former chief of staff Naftali Bennett. The undoubted star of the evening was Yair Lapid, a famous TV presenter who stepped off the screen to found a new centrist party called Yesh Atid (There is a Future). It has been an extraordinary debut. The party may well emerge as the second largest grouping in the new Knesset and should command a place in a Netanyahu-led coalition. Because Mr Lapid is a political newcomer, it's hard to say what price he might try to extract in return for his support. But you can expect a higher profile for the vexed issue of whether Israel's ultra-Orthodox community ought to be required to perform its share of national service (it's currently exempt). The wider world will examine these results for clues about Israel's future attitude towards peace talks with the Palestinians or the possibility of a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. The truth of the matter is that it's far too early to make those kind of judgements, which will depend on the balance of forces within a future coalition more than on the outcome of the popular vote. But the sudden and decisive lurch to the right that many predicted hasn't happened. The results show that there's plenty of life on the left and the centre of Israeli politics too. Some political journalists at Likud headquarters were arguing within hours of the exit polls that the results sent such a confused signal about the political mood in Israel that they made another election likely within a year. We'll see. Having said this is a chastening result for Benjamin Netanyahu it's only fair to record that it's been a thought provoking one for anyone in the business of making political predictions here, too. Mr Netanyahu was supposed to win easily - and he certainly didn't. And the campaign was supposed to have failed to capture the Israeli imagination - and turnout was remarkably high.

{"original_text": "Prof Allyson Pollock and colleagues at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous. They do not want an outright ban but say the sport must change and safeguards are needed. The Rugby Football Union said steps had been taken to make the sport safer. The RFU says the physical and social benefits that rugby offers to children \"massively outweigh any potential drawbacks\" and that myriad safety measures are already in place. These include the provision of a safe environment through investment in pitches and facilities, ensuring adequate first aid and medical facilities, and fully training coaches in methods to prevent injuries to young players. Ministers also want to see more children taking up sport. In 2012, then Culture Minister Jeremy Hunt announced a plan to link up thousands of schools with rugby clubs. But Prof Pollock fears there are not enough safety checks and measures to support this, meaning children could get hurt. She wants to see an increase in the recording of injuries and better injury prevention analysis. She claims that, compared with New Zealand, the UK has few strategies to protect players. Each season, children have about a one in 10 chance of getting injured badly enough that they need at least seven days off the pitch. Some injuries are minor, but others can cause permanent disability. Most rugby injuries occur during the tackle, as players collide at speed. But scrums are the most dangerous part of play, where some of the most serious injuries occur, Prof Pollock and colleagues say in their report in the British Medical Journal. Concussion and spinal trauma are the big concerns. Some injuries can prove fatal - as the Robinson family from County Antrim know only too well after their 14-year-old son, Ben, died having been hurt in a school rugby match in 2011. He collapsed at the end of that match after he was involved in a series of heavy tackles. An inquest heard that the teenager died from brain injuries. Prof Pollock says not enough is being done to put in place injury monitoring and prevention strategies - and little is known about what really works. \"Only by collecting injury data and by providing feedback to individuals and organisations working on safety initiatives will the short - and long-term impact of injury prevention programmes, whether for rugby or any other sport, be known,\" she said. She added some measures - such as matching child rugby players by size rather than age, playing only non-contact matches and having fewer players on the pitch at any one time - may help reduce the frequency of the most severe injuries. The RFU says set-phase play such as scrums and line-outs are introduced gradually, according to a child's rugby development, with scrums initially only containing three players per side and are uncontested. An RFU spokesman said: \"We take player safety extremely seriously, and this is at the core of all the training we deliver to coaches, referees and medics, at all levels of the game. \"Rugby for young people at schools or clubs in England exists in different forms, both contact and non-contact. \"Significant work has been undertaken over a number of years to develop new rules of play to ensure maximum possible safety, with a structured progression to cover the introduction, playing, teaching and refereeing of the game from under-seven to under-18.\" A government spokesman said: \"Player safety in schools and at all levels of sport is absolutely paramount and sports governing bodies and the government are completely committed to it. \"The rugby governing bodies work hard to ensure the sport in schools is played as safely as possible and that young people reap the benefits of participating - boosting their health, self-esteem and encouraging teamwork.\"", "text_perturb": "Prof Allyson Pollock and colleague at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous.

The licensing authority, Teignbridge Council, said it was investigating. The kennel said it was staffed by \"animal lovers who work tirelessly to care and rehabilitate the dogs.\" The RSPCA announced on Friday it had agreed with the Devon and Cornwall Police force's request to review the way in which dogs seized under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 were cared for in kennels. Whistleblowers have made a series of allegations about dogs being put in 3ft by 9ft cages and then, due to safety concerns, not exercised. These include Stella, who had been caged for nearly two years, and Vinnie, a Rottweiler who whistleblowers said had also not been exercised. The BBC has also been told that three puppies, brought in at 11-weeks old, were briefly walked before being denied exercise. Further claims have been made that stray dogs brought in by local councils were also denied exercise. Devon and Cornwall Police are understood to have used the kennels to place a number of seized dogs but said since 2012 they had only instructed staff not to exercise four of these. However, current and former members of staff have said as many as 20 dogs had'Do Not Enter' signs on their cages. Former kennel manager David Clark said in the three years he worked there he did not see those dogs exercised. A spokesman for the kennels said: \"The puppies were walked regularly, as part of their kennel enrichment activities. However, we carry out regular risk assessments, and for these particular dogs, as they came into maturity they started to show signs of aggression. \"We did have to stop the walks during the final few weeks of their stay with us. \"One member of staff was bitten and, of course, we do have to take into account the breed characteristics of their parents, both very dangerous dogs.\" The spokesman said the kennels had cared for many dogs over the years, and had \"an excellent working relationship with Devon and Cornwall Police.\" The spokesman said: \"We are animal lovers and work tirelessly to care and rehabilitate the dogs that come to us from the police, but unfortunately sometimes the risks are too great. \"We would of course welcome and fully support any investigation by the council or RSPCA.

{"original_text": "All examples of this group, known as the Archosauromorpha, lay eggs. This led some scientists to wonder whether there was something in their biology that prevented live births. But examination of the fossil remains of a very long-necked, 245 million-year-old marine reptile from China revealed it was carrying an embryo. Jun Liu, first author of the new study in Nature Communications, told BBC News that the animal would have measured between three and four metres long, with a neck that was about 1.7m long. The embryo may have been around half a metre long and is positioned inside the rib cage of the adult Dinocephalosaurus fossil, which was discovered in 2008 in Luoping County, Yunnan Province in southern China. Researchers had to consider whether the smaller animal might have been part of the adult's last meal. But it's facing forward, whereas swallowed prey generally face backwards because predators consume the animal head first to help it go down the throat. Another line of evidence in favour of the live birth idea is that the small reptile inside the mother is clearly an example of the same species. Co-author Prof Mike Benton, from the University of Bristol, told BBC News that the fossil was important because the Archosauromorpha form one of three large groupings of land-based vertebrates (backboned animals), each including about 10,000 species. Since we now know that no fundamental biological barrier to live births exists in this group, palaeontologists would be \"looking very closely\" at other fossils. He suggested one target would be a group of aquatic crocodile relatives - whose mode of reproduction was not well known. Prof Liu, from Hefei University of Technology in China, said the discovery pushes back evidence of reproductive biology in the archosauromorphs by 50 million years. The mode of reproduction in Dinocephalosaurus also points to how the sex of its offspring was determined. Co-author Prof Chris Organ, from Montana State University, added: \"Some reptiles today, such as crocodiles, determine the sex of their offspring by the temperature inside the nest. \"We identified that Dinocephalosaurus, a distant ancestor of crocodiles, determined the sex of its babies genetically, like mammals and birds.\" Prof Benton explained: \"This combination of live birth and genotypic sex determination seems to have been necessary for animals such as Dinocephalosaurus to become aquatic. \"It's great to see such an important step forward in our understanding of the evolution of a major group coming from a chance fossil find in a Chinese field.\" The possibility that an eggshell once surrounded the embryo but was not preserved in fossilisation could not be ruled out, said Prof Benton. But living Archosauromorphs all lay eggs very early in embryonic development, whereas this embryo is very advanced, with well developed bones. Furthermore, the team says Dinocephalosaurus's long neck and other features of its anatomy suggest it could not have manoeuvred easily out of the water, meaning a reproductive strategy like that of turtles - which lay eggs on land before returning to the water - was probably not an option.

{"original_text": "I did not know this until you pointed this out. It turns out that Vitamin D works to transcriptionally activate genes that convert tryptophan to serotonin. Gene transcription and actual benefits can take up to a couple of weeks for it to actually start having an effect. The human genome is long and full of junk, so it takes quite some time for the active portion of the Vitamin D signaling system to find the necessary genes. Once the process starts though, cellular metabolism and synthesis occur within a few hours of assembly.', \"uRedditorDoc covered the transcription part. The actual production of vitamin D in your skin is grossly mechanical and extra-cellular. I forget all the names, but you body produces an oily substance that saturates your skin (looked it up, it's 7-dehydrocholesterol). The UV-B radiation in sunlight changes that into Vitamin D. That also saturates the skin and your body re-absorbs the modified chemicals. So if you wash your skin immediately before or after the exposure you'll literally wash away much of the benefits of the activity.

Cartilage usually attaches to bone or connects in such a way that leaves marks. Beyond this we can look at their closest relatives. Dinosaurs were the ancestors to birds, which have no ears. Dinosaurs were cousins to lizards and other large reptiles, who again have no ears and kind of suck for hearing. While they may have had ears in the sense of audio sensing organs, they almost certainly did not have ears as we recognize on mammals. Edit- Officially my highest rated comment ever,\" \"It's notable that for animals that we've only found skeletons that artist depictions are probably missing things like loose skin and fat deposits. Unfortunately I can't find a better source so Buzzfeed it shall be. Two paleontologists took skeletons of modern animals and sketched them the way we've been historically sketching dinosaurs. URL1 Granted they took a good bit of artistic liberty for emphasis.,We have found dinosaurs with an outline of their skin fossilized and some with organs. Recently they found a dinosaur so well preserved they are calling it a dinosaur mummy. URL2','The remains from cartilaginous protrusions would be visible in sedimentary deposits. For example, look at [this] (URL3) cast made from the body of someone who died in Pompeii during the Vesuvius explosion. His cartilaginous nose is visible. Dinosaurs would have left similar impressions.', \"I'm not a relevant expert, but doesn't cartilage usually attach to bones leaving telltale marks? Measurements of tendon attachment points gives information about muscle size, for example...,\" \"The short answer is, we can't know for sure 100, from dinosaur to dinosaur. But there are some things we do know. Impressions left by dinosaurs haven't shown us anything weird yet. Birds tend not to have cartilaginous ears and noses, so it's unlikely their ancestors did. And also, cartilage leaves very minute traces of their existence in the form of bone shape, and stress points. For an example, look at the skull of an elephant. We can guess just by examining it really closely how much weight the muscles surrounding the skull were supporting, and where a protrusion was likely based on tiny grooves left on the bone near the nose left by muscle. Logically, if such grooves were present in dinosaur bone, we could conclude similar protrusions. Nothing we've found so far seems to suggest cartilaginous protrusions, but that could change with just the right specimen. Source: Am volunteer who worked on dinosaur bone, who asked this exact question to my Paleontologist supervisors.,\" \"We don't for sure. The only dinosaurs we have actually seen are all feather and fly around, and those don't have noses or ears like humans (although they do have those dangly turkey do-dahs in certain species) Other dinosaurs were probably more similar to modern day reptiles, which again don't tend to have these protrusions. It is hard to know what something looks like when you only have bones to go on.,At one point it was theorized that sauropods had trunks. URL4','Sometimes dinosaur fossils are preserved with skin impressions or other remains (e.g., keratin in dermal spines, beaks, or claws). Some did have \"non-bone\" structures that protruded out from the body. For example, [some sauropod dinosaurs had spikes along their back] (URL6) [PDF], and [skin impressions are known] (URL5) [PDF]. Getting such preservation in key parts of the body is a matter of great luck, but for some dinosaurs and some parts of the body there are constraints on the possibility of soft-tissue \"protrusions., \"Okay, so I've rambled about crocs a bit, but in regards to dinosaurs themselves... There are such things as'dino mummies', where some flesh also turned to stone along with the bones during fossilisation. Like that nodosaur, the armoured dino in the news recently. I believe the only major soft-tissue one was an Edmontosaurus, where they found it had a comb on the top of its head, much like a chicken does. There are 2D variants for smaller animals, like how Archeopteryx still has its feathers preserved. I believe the most relevant is a 125 million year old mammal called Spinolestes that was preserved in enough detail that you could still see the ears. As far as I know there haven't been any records of cartilaginous extensions.,You can actually construct a phylogenetic tree that correctly places saurusthician dinosaurs, such as T. Rex, as the ancestors of modern birds. You would see that nowhere along the genetic tree did cartiligeous appendages appear between dinos and birds, so we find it likely that dinos did not have ears or a discrete nose. We also base it on the musculoskeletal structure we see in fossils, and we model facial features. Basically, dinosaurs did not have the proper musculature to move their ears if they had them, so we find it unlikely once again.', \"We have found preserved enough heads to know that at least those specific dinosaurs had no protruding ears. While we haven't found a lot of well enough preserved heads none of the ones we have found have ears so it's pretty safe to assume none did. It is an assumption though.,\" \"In science it's always best to keep it as simple as possible until you get more information, this is why the image of dinosaurs keeps changing even today when we get more information. However this doesn't stop artist from creating their own interpretations on what could or could not happen and that helps with the mystery in a beautiful, strange or funny way (look up sauropod neck flaps or fluffy t-rex) There are a few examples where we do know that were sporting extra bits and pieces. The horned dinosaurs, ceratopsians, likely had keratin covering their horns leading to some crazy possibilities very similar to horns on a ram or rhinoceros. Keratin erodes easily so it doesn't get preserved leaving what we see on the skulls today. Edit: a word,This might be dumb question but If dinosaurs were killed off by a meteor how are they ancestors to birds?', \"I strongly recommend'All Yesterdays' by Darren Naish, a book about speculative biology. For example, the point out that [this] (URL7) is probably what we'd construct from a baboon skeleton using the same techniques we use to reconstruct dinosaurs. Odds are, they had just as many weird protusions, flashy colors, and other ornamentation as modern animals do. We just have absolutely no idea which had what. Also, we have lots of examples of dinosaurs that were in cold climates, we'd expect them to be fat or fluffy, and possibly kind of adorkable.:),Cartilage is anchored on bone. Is you see ridges of bones in weird areas they were either anchoring cartilage or muscle. This Is how we can reconstruct animals too',Interesting lecture about exceptionally well preserved fossils at the Geological society of London.] (URL8) ', \"Generally speaking, cartilage doesn't fossilize because it deteriorates rapidly. With that being said, we can use their closest living relatives and special fossils to support the lack of ears or a nose. Their closest living descendents, birds, lack external ears and have since the Cretaceous (based on fossils from ChinaMongolia). Additionally, crocodilians lack cartilage ears as well. Simplistically, crocodilians split from dinosaurs way back in the Triassic - before dinosaurs became as derived. This means that the cousins (crocodile-like archosaurs) and direct descendents (birds) lack cartilage appendages. We can deduce that dinosaurs PROBABLY didn't have ears as we know them. The most telling way we can deduce the external appearance of dino ears is really, really well preserved fossils. Dinosaur mummies (there are more than you'd expect) show just an external meatus and no external appendages.,We don't. URL9 From first link; \"Ears are made of cartilage and skin, and these are soft tissues which typically do not preserve well in the fossil record. So paleontologists look closely at modern animals for answers. While mammals have large protruding ears, the closest living relatives of the dinosaurs, birds and reptiles, do not. So it seems very unlikely that dinosaurs would sport large floppy ears. Birds have ear openings. These are holes just below and behind the eyes.

But there are some matter we do know. Impressions left by dinosaur have n't shown us anything weird yet. birdie tend not to have cartilaginous ears and noses , so it 's unlikely their ancestors did. And also , cartilage leaves very minute suggestion of their existence in the form of bone shape , and stress points. For an example , smell at the skull of an elephant. We send away guess just by examining it really closely how much weight the muscles surrounding the skull were supporting , and where a protrusion was likely based on tiny grooves left on the bone near the nose left by muscle.

It is hard to live what something looks like when you only have bones to go on. , At one point it was theorized that sauropods take trunks.

There are such things as'dino mummies ' , where some flesh also turned to stone along with the bones during fossilization. Like that nodosaur , the armoured dino in the word recently. I believe the only major soft-tissue one was an Edmontosaurus , where they found it had a comb on the top of its head , much like a chicken coif. There are 2D variants for smaller animals , like how Archeopteryx nonetheless has its feathers preserved. I believe the most relevant is a 125 million year old mammal called Spinolestes that was preserved in enough detail that you could still get wind the ears. As far as I know thither have n't been any records of cartilaginous extensions. , You can actually construct a phylogenetic sir herbert beerbohm tree that correctly places saurusthician dinosaurs , such as T. rex , as the ancestors of modern birds. You would see that nowhere along the genetic tree did cartiligeous appendages appear between dinos and birds , so we see it likely that dinos did not have ears or a discrete nose. We also base it on the musculoskeletal structure we project in fossils , and we model facial features. essentially , dinosaurs did not have the proper musculature to move their ears if they had them , so we find it unlikely once again.

However this does n't stop artist from creating their own interpretations on what could or could not happen and that helps with the mystery in a beautiful , strange or funny mode ( look up sauropod neck flaps or fluffy t-rex ) There are a few examples where we do know that were sporting extra bits and pieces. The horned dinosaurs , ceratopsians , likely had keratin covering their horns leading to some crazy possibilities very similar to horns on a aries or rhinoceros. Keratin erodes easily so it does n't bugger off preserved leaving what we see on the skulls today.

With that embody said , we can use their closest living relatives and special fossils to support the lack of ears or a nose. Their closest life descendents , birds , lack external ears and have since the Cretaceous ( based on fossils from ChinaMongolia ). Additionally , crocodilians lack cartilage ears as good. Simplistically , crocodilians split from dinosaurs way back in the Triassic - before dinosaurs became as descend. This stand for that the cousins ( crocodile-like archosaurs ) and direct descendents ( birds ) lack cartilage appendages. We can deduce that dinosaurs PROBABLY did n't have pinna as we know them. The most telling way we can deduce the outside appearance of dino ears is really , really well preserved fossils. Dinosaur mummies ( there are more than you 'd expect ) show just an external meatus and no external member. , We coiffe n't. URL9 From first link ; `` Ears are made of cartilage and skin , and these are soft tissues which typically do not preserve advantageously in the fossil record. So paleontologists look closely at modern fauna for answers. While mammals have large protruding capitulum , the closest living relatives of the dinosaurs , birds and reptiles , do not.

If your state 's popular vote is majority Democrat , for instance , then your state will appoint electors who sustain sworn to vote for the Democratic candidate. , Your vote counts toward the total votes for the state in which you reside , and those votes determine the tie up of the members of the electoral college who vote on who becomes President. We are a representative democracy and your vote selects the person who represents you in the election of the chairwoman. ' , 'First , it 's important to commend that voting is a civic duty. You are n't obligated to vote , and should n't feel pressured to vote if you do n't feel comfortable make so , but casting a vote is something we are called upon to do as citizens to help ensure the legitimacy of the system even if our one vote does n't affect the outcome directly. For the presidential election , your vote bequeath be counted to determine who bequeath serve as the `` electors '' from your state. By law and practice , these electors will honk votes for whichever candidate received the most votes from your state. indeed your vote increases , by however small an increment , the chances that the candidate you prefer will win the electoral votes from your state. For united states senate ( if you have one ) and Congressional elections , your vote is counted directly on behalf of the person you select. So , again incrementally , your vote directly contributes to the probability that your preferred person wins. The exact mechanisms of voting can vary state by state , but most of the time whichever candidate gets the most balloting wins the seat in question. Then there are also local races for everything from school board to mayor to dog catcher , every bit well as local referendums and bond issues. Here the rules can vary much more , but the basic system is once again the same. ' , `` You can guarantee that you will have zero influence on your city , state , and land by doing nothing.

The differences between viruses and bacteriafungiother things that can make you sick is that viruses are the robots of the germ world. They don't replicate themselves like other life forms do. There are actually a wide class viruses known as bacteriophages which attack other bacteria and use them to make copies of themselves. Basically what a virus does is attack and attach itself to another cell (plant, animal, sometimes has to be specific) and inject its RNA into the cell. That RNA then corrupts the cells normal activity and overhauls it into a virus making factory, which produces the different body parts of a virus, then puts them together to make new viruses. Then depending on whether the virus is of the lytic or lysogenic variety, it either explodes the cell popping the new viruses everywhere, or it goes into a dormant state waiting for different conditions to continue activity. This is how all viruses replicate themselves. Another difference is that viruses can never be fully eliminated from the body the way other diseases can. This is because of the way they replicate themselves. This is opposed to having a bacteria that comes in and divides itself and maybe eats your tissue like gangrene or something. Your body can come in guns blazing, and once the last bacteria cell is killed, its game over. Viruses put their RNA into your normal cells DNA, so whenever your immune system goes down a bit, the virus might pop its head back up. (Think Herpes). So if the virus is in the lysogenic cycle I mentioned earlier, not exploding your cells, then that means whenever your cell replicates itself by mitosis, the viral RNA is also replicated, and you have another potential virus making factory on your hands. It is like a sleeper terrorist cell. To summarize, the distinction you made is a false dichotomy.

{"original_text": "Batch normalization (BN) has become a standard technique for training the modern deep networks. However, its effectiveness diminishes when the batch size becomes smaller, since the batch statistics estimation becomes inaccurate. That hinders batch normalization's usage for 1) training larger model which requires small batches constrained by memory consumption, 2) training on mobile or embedded devices of which the memory resource is limited.

Researchers have recently examined a number of factors that affect information diffusion in online social networks, including: the novelty of information, users' activity levels, who they pay attention to, and how they respond to friends' recommendations. Using URLs as markers of information, we carry out a detailed study of retweeting, the primary mechanism by which information spreads on the Twitter follower graph. Our empirical study examines how users respond to an incoming stimulus, i.e., a tweet (message) from a friend, and reveals that dynamically decaying visibility, which is the increasing cognitive effort required for discovering and acting upon a tweet, combined with limited attention play dominant roles in retweeting behavior. Specifically, we observe that users retweet information when it is most visible, such as when it near the top of their Twitter feed. Moreover, our measurements quantify how a user's limited attention is divided among incoming tweets, providing novel evidence that highly connected individuals are less likely to propagate an arbitrary tweet. Our study indicates that the finite ability to process incoming information constrains social contagion, and we conclude that rapid decay of visibility is the primary barrier to information propagation online.", "text_perturb": "How far and how fast does information spread in social media ?

{"original_text": "In this work we focus on the problem of colorization for image compression. Since color information occupies a large proportion of the total storage size of an image, a method that can predict accurate color from its grayscale version can produce a dramatic reduction in image file size. But colorization for compression poses several challenges. First, while colorization for artistic purposes simply involves predicting plausible chroma, colorization for compression requires generating output colors that are as close as possible to the ground truth. Second, many objects in the real world exhibit multiple possible colors. Thus, in order to disambiguate the colorization problem some additional information must be stored to reproduce the true colors with good accuracy. To account for the multimodal color distribution of objects we propose a deep tree-structured network that generates for every pixel multiple color hypotheses, as opposed to a single color produced by most prior colorization approaches. We show how to leverage the multimodal output of our model to reproduce with high fidelity the true colors of an image by storing very little additional information.

An essential aspect is that traits collectively evolve under the repeated action of social influence interactions, which is the focus of many quantitative studies of cultural dynamics.

However, recent work has shown that the outcome of social influence dynamics strongly depends on the nature of the initial state: if this is sampled from empirical data instead of being generated in a uniformly random way, a higher level of cultural diversity is found after long-term dynamics, for the same level of propensity towards collective behavior in the short-term; moreover, if the initial state is obtained by shuffling the empirical traits among people, the level of long-term cultural diversity is in-between those obtained for the empirical and random counterparts.

To address this question, we articulate a synergistic behavior spreading model on a double layer network, where the key manifestation of the synergistic interactions is that the adoption of one behavior by a node in one layer enhances its probability of adopting the behavior in the other layer.

Unfortunately , all estimation algorithms belonging to the family of gaussian filters ( such as the widely-used extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter ) are inherently incompatible with such fat-tailed sensor models. The contribution of this paper is to show that any Gaussian filter can be made compatible with fat-tailed sensor model by applying one simple change : Instead of filtering with the physical measurement , we propose to filter with a pseudo measurement obtained by applying a feature function to the physical measurement. We derive such a feature function which is optimum under some conditions. Simulation results show that the purport method can effectively handle measurement outliers and allows for robust filtering in both linear and nonlinear systems. ", "label": 1}

By means of the PDF of SNR , the bit-error ratio ( BER ) of DC biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( DCO-OFDM ) in additive white Gaussian noise ( AWGN ) television channel is evaluated. A closed form approximation for the BER of UE with random orientation course is presented which shows a good match with Monte-Carlo simulation results. ", "label": 1}

In particular, in order to enable the deep-RL framework to account for extreme network conditions and operate in highly reliable systems, a new approach based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) is proposed. This GAN approach is used to pre-train the deep-RL framework using a mix of real and synthetic data, thus creating an experienced deep-RL framework that has been exposed to a broad range of network conditions. The proposed deep-RL framework is particularly applied to a multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) resource allocation system. Formally, this resource allocation problem in OFDMA systems is posed as a power minimization problem under reliability, latency, and rate constraints. To solve this problem using experienced deep-RL, first, the rate of each user is determined.

With more than 33 million confirmed cases and over a million deaths, global health organizations are still a long way from fully containing the pandemic. This pandemic has raised serious questions about the emergency preparedness of health agencies, not only in terms of treatment of an unseen disease, but also in identifying its early symptoms. In the particular case of COVID-19, several studies have indicated that chest radiography images of the infected patients show characteristic abnormalities. However, at the onset of a given pandemic, such as COVID-19, there may not be sufficient data for the affected cases to train models for their robust detection. Hence, supervised classification is ill-posed for this problem because the time spent in collecting large amounts of infected peoples' data could lead to the loss of human lives and delays in preventive interventions. Therefore, we formulate this problem within a one-class classification framework, in which the data for healthy patients is abundantly available, whereas no training data is present for the class of interest (COVID-19 in our case). To solve this problem, we present COVIDomaly, a convolutional autoencoder framework to detect unseen COVID-19 cases from the chest radiographs. We tested two settings on a publicly available dataset (COVIDx) by training the model on chest X-rays from (i) only healthy adults, and (ii) healthy and other non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and detected COVID-19 as an anomaly.

{"original_text": "The long-standing byzantine agreement problem gets more attention in recent years due to the increasing demand for scalable geo-replicated Byzantine state machine replication (SMR) systems (e.g., Blockchains). To date, the key bottleneck of such systems is the communication cost of the byzantine agreement they employ as a building block, which motivates many researchers to search for low-communication byzantine agreement protocols. The conventional approach is to design deterministic protocols in the eventually synchronous communication model that are optimized to reduce the communication cost after the global stabilization time (GST). In this paper, we challenge the conventional approach and argue it is not the best fit for scalable SMR systems since it might induce an unbounded communication cost during asynchronous periods before GST, which we prove to be inherent. Instead, we forgo eventual synchrony and propose a different approach that hopes for the best (synchrony) but prepares for the worst (asynchrony). Accordingly, we design an optimistic protocol that first tries to reach an agreement via an efficient deterministic algorithm that relies on synchrony for termination, and then, only if an agreement was not reached due to asynchrony, the protocol uses a randomized asynchronous algorithm for fallback that guarantees termination with probability 1. Although randomized asynchronous algorithms are considered to be costly, we design our solution to pay this cost only when an equivalent cost has already been paid while unsuccessfully trying the synchronous protocol.

Instead of just recognizing past places and outputting their poses, it is desired that a global localization system estimates the pose of current place images.

Then, given live and recollected images, a visual localization system outputs the relative camera pose represented by those images. To estimate the relative camera pose between the recollected and the current images, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained with the two images as input and a relative pose vector as output.

A significant challenge in deploying closed loop controllers is reliable proprioception via integrated sensing in soft robots. Despite the considerable advances accomplished in fabrication, modelling, and model-based control of soft robots, integrated sensing and estimation is still in its infancy. To that end, this paper introduces a new method of estimating the degree of curvature of a soft robot using a stretchable sensing skin. The skin is a spray-coated piezoresistive sensing layer on a latex membrane. The mapping from the strain signal to the degree of curvature is estimated by using a recurrent neural network.

Now give me my burger \" The inmate gestures, pointing at the tray the guard was still holding. She drops it on the table and shoves it towards the inmate, fries flying everywhere. With a small sneer, she places the lukewarm soda next to the now disheveled cheeseburger. \" Fine. I hope you choke on it you son of a bitch. Actually, don't \" She tells the inmate. \" Wow \" exclaims the inmate, with an overly dramatic hurt look. \" You are definitely not getting a tip \" he adds, the now insulting smile returning to his face. The exasperated guard turns, ready to leave the inmate to his dinner as he attempts to re build the burger. \" It won't be as good as the ones my mom used to make, that's for sure. Maybe she'll make me some after this .\" The guard stops, surprised. \" I didn't know you were a spiritual man. How convenient \" She responds. \" I am now. Can hurt my chances right? \" \" I guess not .\" They both appear to let their minds wander off for a few seconds. \" We used to have these big family gatherings, with all my brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, grandparents, neighbors... basically anyone that would show up was family for a day.

I always won of course, but I doubt he'd agree \" \" But you didn't get any visitors \" The guard blurts out, immediately regretting it. She looks like she's about to apologize, but doesn't. The inmate seems to have noticed, and quickly addresses her remark. \" They couldn't come. Told you my sister's smart right? I heard she was in college the last couple years, now has some important job in a firm on the east coast. She's a big shot lawyer now. Not that it would have helped me through .\" The guard's lips twitch, forming a small smile. She stays silent: They both know he's avoiding something. \" You're probably wondering why my brother didn't come \" He mumbles. \" No I- \" \" It's okay \" He says, a bit louder this time. \" The reason he and I fought so much is because we were so similar. A bit too similar actually .\" The inmate looks down at his lap, clutching the fabric of his prison issued uniform. \" He... \" The inmate sounds choked. \" He got mixed up with the wrong crowd. My crowd .\" A tear rolls down the inmate's cheek, and he quickly wipes it away with his sleeve. \" When you live the kind of life we had, there's only two ways out. Prison, or ... \" The inmate doesn't bother finishing his thought, though the meaning was clear. The guard stood rooted in place, staring at the ground. As she finally moved, approaching the inmate with her hand outstretched, another voice was heard behind them. \" It's time \" said the warden. \" I'll go get some guys to escort him \" As the warden leaves, the guard hesitates to approach the inmate. He's silent, lost in his own thoughts. After a few seconds, the guard and the inmate are brought back to reality by the sound of footsteps echoing down the hall. \" I'm sorry \" She whispers. \" It's time \" \" I know.

{"original_text": "Angelique was having an intense staring competition with the clock above the tv on the opposite end of the room. 10 minutes. Ten minutes to go. At the end of those ten minutes, she would learn what the rest of her life would be like. The seconds seemed to slow and it felt like it took hours for a single moment to pass. Angelique's stomach tightened, and she glanced around the room at the party guests. In just ten minutes, it would be 18 years to the second since she was born. And then she would get to be like the rest of her friends and classmates. The young girl, with mahogany hair and tan skin, was the youngest in her class, and quite possibly in her grade at school. Naturally, everyone else had already received their powers. Some people's powers were limited to small'party tricks', such as changing their appearance, and had no significant effect on their surroundings. Some had abilities that made their life easier, such as hovering a couple inches off the ground, allowing them to easily glide down the street. In more extreme cases, students received potentially dangerous powers that required them to see a psychiatrist at least once a month to make sure they could handle the responsibility, or, if they were lucky, they received potentially life-saving powers and were recruited into the NHA, National Heroes Association. A sort of super-natural police force. So far there had been little more then a handful of those people at Angelique's school that year, although she hoped to possibly be added to that small list. Sensing her distress, her friend, Sam, who was lounging on the couch beside her, waved her hand in front of her face, breaking her out of her trance. \" Yoohoo! \" She chirped, giggling. \" Why don't you take your eyes off the clock for a moment? You're not gon na make time fly any faster that way, ya know. \" \" Y-yeah..... ok, sure, \" Angelique stammered. \" So what kind of cake did you get? \" Sam asked, trying to distract her friend. \" Oh, it's red velvet. Nothing too special. \" \" Sounds absolutely delicious. \" Angelique reflexively glanced back at the clock, which now told her she had 7 minutes left, only have Sam cup her cheek, turning her head and forcing her to look away again. \" Did you watch that anime I told you about? \" \" A bit. I don't think it's really my thing. \" \" Aww, but it's so awesome! \" \" It's kinda creepy, really. Why is there some kind of sexually-charged event every five minutes? \" The meaningless chatter continued between the two of them. Every time their conversation seemed to reach a dead end, Sam frantically grabbed at another random topic, like a random song she heard on the radio that she didn't understand, or a piece of local news that didn't really affect anything. Angelique could tell Sam was trying her best to keep her anxiety low, and she was grateful for her efforts. But every now and then she would manage she catch a glimpse of the clock, and recalculated the time she had left. 5 minutes, then 3, 2, 1..... Angelique watched as the seconds ticked down to the final moment, then closed her eyes. The room got quiet. There was only the sound of wind blowing past and the feeling of intense sunlight on her skin. Sunlight? That wasn't right..... even if she was outside, it was a cloudy day, with no sunlight anywhere near her house. Angelique opened her eyes and found herself in the middle of a foreign landscape. A flat, dry, wasteland. There was nothing around her except for dust and rocks. No plant or animal life to be seen. She looked up into a dark blue sky and shielded her eyes from the bright red sun that beat down on her. Within seconds, her skin began to burn, and she struggled to breathe. It only got worse and worse as her skin began to boil in the hot sun. With the last of her breath, she let out a choked scream, and collapsed to the ground. - No one was ever certain about what happened to Angelique. At the very moment where she should have gained her powers, she seemed to slip into a trance-like state, then her eyes rolled back into her head and she screamed before falling unconscious. On the way to the hospital, she began to spasm uncontrollably. Once they got to the ER, the doctors told her parents that she was in a coma. Sometimes, when a person gains their power, it's simply too much for them to bear. No one ever gets to know what the power is, and their brain activity is undecipherable. If there's a way to deactivate the power, the victim never seems to have a calm enough moment to find out how to. No drugs or medical procedures can bring them out of their shock. A week later, after watching Angelique's body shake and choke with no end in sight, Angelique's parents were forced to make the difficult decision to cut her life support, and watched as her vital functions slowed to a halt, never to start again.", "text_perturb": "Angelique was having an vivid staring competition with the clock above the tv on the opposite end of the room. 10 moment.

The Air Force.\" He sighed. \"The Air Force advanced you through their ranks quickly because you were the daughter of one of their darlings, and you demonstrated that you had her intuition and affability. You had a stellar career in store until you exploited every opportunity to sneak into their classified records in order to find evidence of a cover-up.\" \"What you're forgetting is that I did find evidence of a cover-up,\" she argued. \"You found evidence that her plane was found intact and sold to a private buyer in India through the black market. This indicates corruption, but no cover-up, and no aliens, young lady.\" \"Don't dismiss me because of my gender, Dad. I'm not so young and I'm definitely no lady. I also found evidence that they doctored her file after her disappearance to show that she was suffering from post-partum depression.\" \"Maybe it was doctored, or maybe her counselor was just updating the file for completeness.\" \"Five years after her last child was born? Or maybe they didn't want to pay out the insurance by ruling it a suicide.\" \"So now there's more than one conspiracy?\" \"Why can't there be?\" \"Because, Reggie, once you need multiple theories to support your paranoia, it conflicts with Occam's Razor.\" \"Dad, you went along with it because it suits your personal agenda. You didn't want the insurance payout, because it was affirmation that said she was really dead. You loved her and you never wanted that. You wanted to believe that she had post-partum depression, freaked out, shut off communications and flew off to India. You want to think that she never called you because she had a mental breakdown and started a new life.\" \"Whereas you think what, Reggie? Still aliens?\" \"Yes.\" Regina paused for dramatic effect. \"And she's home.\" She threw open the door to the parlor, where Adina sat, flipping through the news on her tablet. \"Did you have fun berating your father, dear?\" she said. \"Very much so.\" \"It's not kind, you know. He's been through a lot.\" Dex walked up to her, staring at her face as if it were a hallucination, then suddenly fell to his knees in front of her. He took her hand and began to cry. \"Dex, please don't. I lost the ability to cry years ago, and it makes me uncomfortable.\" \"Where did you go? Where have you been? My love...\" \"Haven't you been listening to your daughter? I was abducted by an alien armada as they tried to infiltrate Earth.\" \"Are you..... joking?\" \"Not at all. They forced my plane to land over the Marshall Islands, took me captive and forced me to teach them everything I knew about navigation, geography and modern technology. They couldn't leave me here while they regrouped at their home planet to make a battle plan, but the General took a fondness to me, and brought me home to Asphodel as his bride of war.\" Dex's jaw dropped. \"I fought him at first,\" she said quietly, \"but he was an expert at breaking people. I was light years from my family. It was either adapt to my new life, or die. I chose to live.\" \"I don't care. I'm glad you're home to stay, and we're going to make everything alright.\" \"What is here for me? A world that will be disgusted with me for betraying them? A husband, who will be disappointed by my failure to honor my marriage vows? A child who looks at me in pity as one who has been enslaved and abused? My life on Earth is gone, Dex. You have no idea how much joy it gives me to see Regina, tall and strong and healthy, but I have no other reason to stay. On Asphodel, I matter. I'm the woman who united and saved the planet. I'm a general, something I could never have achieved in the Air Force.\" \"Do you know how you inspired me, Mom?\" Regina said. \"You did everything in your power to ensure that we had a good childhood, even as you pursued your career. You taught us about the strength of being a woman in a world that is stacked against us. I can't believe that now you're just the thrall of a dictator.\" Adina pulled herself to her full height. \"Slow down one minute,\" she snapped. \"I'm not a thrall. Maybe I seemed to be, once, when my very survival depended on him, but things change. I direct my own life now. Would I be here now if he had any control over me?\" \"Tell me that you would rather be there on his ugly rock pelted by ugly rocks whose only aim is to pelt more rocks at other planets to turn them into ugly rocks too!\" Adina's lips turned up at that, and despite the tension in the room, both women laughed. \"Regina,\" she said quietly. \"You speak of strength. I can defend myself against almost any physical attack. I resisted the attempts of my kidnapper to break me emotionally, and turned him into my admirer. I command the loyalty of ten thousand troops, I use them as a force for societal change, and I have no issues with making difficult judgment calls and ordering those troops to their death. I do not, however, have the strength wake up every day and look into the eyes of a husband I betrayed.\" \"You're supporting a regime that will destroy Earth,\" Regina said. Adina waved her off. \"He won't destroy Earth. He just wants to unify Earth under the same authoritarian rule that has been so successful on Asphodel.\" \"Are you serious, Mom? You think that he can unite a strange planet, of which he has no understanding of the culture and complexity of international relations, by exporting a kind of government which barely worked on his own world?\" \"For the same reason that a family might see a counselor, Regina, it sometimes helps to have an external, expert point of view. He knows more than you think. He's been observing Earth for decades, after all.\" Regina snorted. Adina sighed. \"Alright. You're probably right. I'll overthrow the bastard.\" She stood up and kissed Regina on the cheek, and neatly stepped over the broken form of her ex-husband as she pressed a button on what looked like the remote starter for a car.

Or maybe they did n't want to pay out the policy by ruling it a suicide. `` `` So now there 's more than one cabal ? '' `` Why ca n't there be ? '' `` Because , Reggie , once you need multiple theories to support your paranoia , it conflicts with Occam 's Razor. `` `` dada , you went along with it because it suits your personal agenda. You did n't want the insurance payout , because it was affirmation that said she was actually dead. You know her and you never wanted that. You wanted to believe that she had post-partum depression , freak out out , shut off communications and flew off to India. You need to think that she never called you because she had a mental breakdown and started a new life. `` `` Whereas you think what , Reggie ? Still alien ? '' `` Yes. `` Regina paused for dramatic result. `` And she 's dwelling. `` She threw open the threshold to the parlor , where Adina sat , flipping through the news on her tablet. `` Did you have fun trounce your father , dear ? '' she said. `` really much so. `` `` It 's not kind , you live. He 's been through a mickle. `` Dex walked up to her , gaze at her face as if it were a hallucination , then suddenly fell to his knees in front of her. He took her hand and get down to cry. `` Dex , please cause n't. I lost the ability to cry days ago , and it makes me uncomfortable. `` `` Where did you go ? Where have you constitute ? My love. . . `` `` Have n't you been take heed to your daughter ? I was abducted by an alien armada as they tried to infiltrate Earth. `` `` embody you. . . . . joking ? '' `` non at all. They pressure my plane to land over the Marshall Islands , took me captive and pressure me to teach them everything I knew about navigation , geography and modern technology. They could n't provide me here while they regrouped at their home planet to make a battle plan , but the General took a fondness to me , and brought me home to Asphodel as his bride of war. `` Dex 's jaw drop off. `` I fought him at first , '' she said softly , `` but he was an expert at breaking people. I represent light years from my family. It was either adapt to my new life story , or die. I chose to hold out. `` `` I practise n't care. I 'm glad you 're home to stay , and we 're function to make everything alright. `` `` What is hither for me ? A world that will be disgusted with me for betraying them ? A husband , who will be disappointed by my failure to honor my marriage vows ? A child who looks at me in pity as one who has been enslaved and abused ? My life on Earth is gone , Dex. You have no thought how much joy it gives me to see Regina , tall and strong and healthy , but I have no other reason to stay. On Asphodel , I count. I 'm the char who united and saved the planet. I 'm a general , something I could never have achieved in the Air force out. `` `` Do you acknowledge how you inspired me , Mom ? '' Regina said. `` You did everything in your power to ensure that we had a expert childhood , even as you pursued your career. You taught us about the strength of personify a woman in a world that is stacked against us. I ca n't believe that now you 're just the thraldom of a dictator. `` Adina pulled herself to her full elevation. `` Slow down one minute , '' she snatch. `` I 'm not a thrall. Maybe I seemed to be , once , when my very survival depend on him , but things change. I direct my own life forthwith. Would I be here now if he had any control over me ? '' `` Tell me that you would rather be there on his ugly rock pelted by ugly rocks whose only aim is to pepper more rocks at other planets to turn them into ugly rocks too ! '' Adina 's lips turned up at that , and despite the tension in the room , both women laughed. `` Regina , '' she say quietly. `` You verbalize of strength. I tin defend myself against almost any physical attack. I resisted the attempts of my abductor to break me emotionally , and turned him into my admirer. I command the loyalty of ten thousand troops , I use them as a force for societal change , and I have no issues with making difficult legal opinion calls and ordering those troops to their death. I do not , however , have the strength wake up every day and calculate into the eyes of a husband I betrayed. `` `` You 're supporting a regimen that will destroy Earth , '' Regina said. Adina waved her off. `` He wo n't destroy Earth. He just now wants to unify Earth under the same authoritarian rule that has been so successful on Asphodel. `` `` Are you serious , Mom ? You think that he can unite a strange planet , of which he has no understanding of the culture and complexity of international relations , by exporting a kind of government which barely figure out on his own world ? '' `` For the same reason that a family might see a counselor , Regina , it sometimes helps to have an external , expert point of view. He knows more than than you think. He 's been observing Earth for tenner , after all. `` regina snorted. Adina suspire. `` Alright. You 're believably right. I 'll override the bastard. `` She stood up and kissed Regina on the cheek , and neatly stepped over the broken form of her ex-husband as she pressed a button on what expect like the remote starter for a car. A thundering roar shook the house. `` I 'll equal home by Christmas. ``", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "\"So..... As you all know...\" Mayor Sharda tapped a few papers against the podium. \"We have a slight problem on our hands.\" She was a short and prime woman with nest of blond curly hair on her head. Her makeup was slightly smudged and she had smears of ash on her clothing. The group of individuals she was addressing was a group of middle school children, huddled together in the broken down remains of their auditorium. Most of the school had fallen in disarray since the first attack, but it was one of the few remaining buildings large enough to host many individuals. \"We're going to do a slight recap of events. Some of you are recent additions to our group, as you have had your twelfth birthdays.\" She gave a signal to her assistant, a unicorn named Charlene, and a projection of a tall but cruel looking man appeared behind her. He had a pointy hat and a long beard marred with gray. \"This is High Emperor Wizard Supreme Tim. He emerged from the magical world three years ago and has set about conquering the human race.\" Some of the girls in the audience did a gasp and turned their heads away. Many of the younger ones bit their lips to fight back the tears as the older ones clenched their fists tightly. All of them had lost friends and family to the Malevolent Tim. At first, the media claimed it was a terrorist group out of Germany. That they spread false propaganda of magic to their cult follows. Then it became an argument that they had advanced technology. By the time the world caught on to their true nature, it was far to late to strike up any sort of efficient counter attack. \"The past few years have been harsh, but we believe that our small town of Elizabeth has the answer.\" The image changed behind Mayor Sharda again, this time revealing an old text writen in archaic script. \"When our town was founded, a famous medicine woman declared that a special chosen child will arise from this place any time a great evil threatened the world. Now, more than ever before, is the point where we need to rely on that prophecy. It is quite possible that someone located here will gain the ability to defeat Tim.\" She stared out at the room and let that sink in. The older children were still averting their gaze while some of the younger ones started to look hopeful, mystified by what the mayor was saying. \"Unfontunetely, we do not know exactly how they are chosen. We have sought out different ways, and every time that particular person has unfortunately failed.\" The last child was a boy named William. They threw some old bones in the air and they pointed to him when they fell. He sought to learn magic himself and mastered some limited spells, but was quickly killed off by one of Tim's poltergeist inhabited tanks. Shield spells don't work well against tank shells. Before that was a girl named Adelaide who was chosen due to being born under an astrological event. She was the Chosen One for less than a week when Tim sent a thirty foot tall assassin bug after her. They said it was a slow death. That her screams were heard in the middle of town for hours. It was supposed to be a warning for them not to try again. But try again they did. And now it was time to select a new child in an attempt to stop the Malevolent Tim. \"So like we have many, many times before. We are going to attempt to find our Chosen One. Charlene here will whisk you out of town safely and we can all go back into hiding and fearing every day for our lives.\" The unicorn gave the children a nod as the woman covered her eyes with one hand. The other stretched out a finger and started to point randomly in front of her. \"Eenie, meenie, mineie, moe. Catch a tiger by the toe...\" The older of the group started to shuffle about. They placed younger children in front of themselves or hide behind each other. Some of the younger ones purposely sought out the finger, still thinking that magic was a game. \"If he follows, let him go.\" There were a few who just gave up completely and laid against the floor. \"Eenie, meenie, mineie...\" Mayor Sharda paused. Her finger pointed at a girl who froze in place. There were beads of sweat forming on her forehead as the mayor's posture stiffened. Suddenly her arm flitted over to the right, before anyone could think to dodge it. Her eyes snapped open and she stared hard at the one who she found. As though she were trying to burn the image of them into her memories. It was a tall boy, around fourteen. Tomorrow, he would turn fifteen and would be no longer eligible for selection. Today, he was still very much fourteen and very much chosen to be a hero. \"Moe!\" The mayor cried out, wagging a finger at him. \"It's you! You are the Chosen One!\" The boy rubbed the back of his head and looked around. Everyone else was staring directly at him but he was doing his best to be unimpressed. \"I think she was talking to you.\" He nudged the much shorter boy in front of him with his elbow. \"Better go on stage and work that out.\" \"No! Not him, you! You Roger Perkins! You!\" Mayor Sharda knew the name of every person here. \"No you get on that unicorn right this instant and go work on your destiny!\" \"Ah, well...\" He stepped back and gave a shrug as the unicorn approached. \"You see, that would be kind of difficult. I'm not a virgin, after all. Can't really go riding on...\" Charlene nudged him in the shoulder as he attempted to side step away from her. \" ..... Fine.\" He tossed his arms in the air. \"Just fine! FINE! I'll go fix things!\" \"Now remember, you have until you turn fifteen to stop Wizard Supreme Tim. After that, you would have failed your mission and humanity will be doomed.\" Mayor Sharda frowned and narrowed her eyes. \"I turn fifteen tomorrow.\" He looked over at the clock on the wall, which he quickly realized was broken. \"That means I only have a few hours to do it?!\" \"Thirteen hours and fourty-seven minutes, precisely.\" The mayor nodded. \"It's your fault for not coming forth as the Chosen One sooner.\" She folded her arms and nodded slowly. \"It should be fine, Wizard Supreme Tim has many spies within Elizabeth. He always comes personally to finish off whatever child we pick near Choosing Day. I'm sure that you'll have till well before midnight to figure out how you are going to beat him!\" Roger was going to issue another word of protest but music had already started to play. A farewell tune to all who have become Chosen. \" ..... Fine!\" He patted the unicorns neck and she stooped down so he could prop himself up on her back. \"I'm going to go out there. I'm going to save humanity and dammit I am going to find a girl while I do it. Just to prove you all wrong!\" Charlene reared back and Roger got a look of panic on his face as he struggled to not get tossed off. \"Good luck!\" The children cried out to him as he headed out of the auditorium with a scowl on his face.

Night shift was nice, the lights were dimmed aboard the ship in the off hours, stem to stern. Captain's orders, it allowed better regulation of circadian rhythms for the rest of the crew and let Jim avoid the dazzling brilliance that passed for \"day\" aboard the cruiser. He supposed it was his fault, born and raised on Sian where the noon time sun was little brighter than a full moon on Earth. The engine hummed softly as Jim performed routine maintenance. The other man on duty was Stuart, about as salty a sailor as Jim had ever seen, with hair that grew only in patches and a scar that ran from jaw to eyebrow beneath an eye patch. Jim was more than a little afraid of Stu. \"Fluid'll need changing\" Jim nearly leaped from his skin. Drawing a shaking breath he responded \"maintenance logs shows it was changed eight hours ago.\" \"Maintenance logs is wrong, then. Changed up the fluid but didn't clean the filter. Always clean the filter. Drain, clean the filter, fill. Not so hard is it?\" \"Er, no...\" Jim checked the dip stick and noted the reactor cyclant was a touch discolored. \"Well tell that to the day shift crew! Filter needs cleaning every time the fluid's changed. You're not like Alston, I can tell. Pompos ass, thinks'cuz he studied engineering he knows how to be an engineer.

So now let's talk about the airlocks.\" \"Airlocks?\" Jim asked, taking the proffered flask. It held rum, strong enough to make his eyes water and sweet as candy. \"Aye, the airlocks. You'll use'em now and again, replace ablation plate, drive needs work on the outside, you'll make your way outside from time to time. But it's the airlocks you need to look out for.\" \"What do you mean?\" He took another swig and passed the flask back. \"You're not the first lad in space, Jim, and you certainly won't be the last.

You heard of the Machanna?\" \"Sure, heard about it in school, lost to the stars out around Tau 3, it's held up as a prime example of design failure.\" \"Oh aye, coolant had to be jettisoned from outside, had to be done once a week or the reactor'd overheat. Did they tell you in academy why they couldn't? No, I suppose not. That's not a popular story, not sanctioned and all that. Well they gave the job to a new kid, a sort of hazing. Coolant was a gel back then, was real funny to tell the new kid he needed to clean his suit before they could let him back in. Well, they gave the kid the job, and of course he gets the coolant all over himself, no way not to. They tell him he's got ta clean his suit before they let him back in, so he starts to panic, yeah, because he's already low on air. He flails around a bit, loses most of his tools, everything but his number six scraper. The folks inside see him and tell him to stop, but he's not listenin' see, because he things he's got to clean his suit. So he starts at it with the scraper, and you can't clean a suit with a scraper, it just can't be done, and sure as shit the suit gets a puncture. \"Now the boy was in a fuss before, but now he's in a panic. They're shouting over the radio to get inside the airlock, it's good enough, it was just a joke. Finally the kid gets the message, and pulls himself in. He's bleedin air fast and they dump emergency tanks to equalize the pressure inside the airlock. Kid thinks he's safe and pulls off his helmet. He's half blind, sweat in his eyes, out of breath, so he reaches up to open the door, but the airlock's faulty, the outer door blows off, vents the atmosphere in the airlock and takes the kid with it.\" \"Holy shit.\" \"So the crew's watchin him out there. They don't tell you in academy, but vacuum doesn't kill you like they used to think it did. It's a hard death out there, your skin swells up, your eyes get so dry they'll crack, and there's no relief until you suffocate.

{"original_text": "\"Under the aegis of our gods we took to the stars. Under the guidance of the Pearl of Dawn we ranged out and met other species. With the kindness of the Keeper of Hearths we brought them to our fold. Behind the protection of the Sorrowful Matron we defeated their attacks. Under the gaze of the Shrouded Captain we accepted their gods alongside ours. And now, following the light of the Soothing Torch, we will bring glory to our empire.\" It was a common prayer, and Alit spent a few moments meditating on its meaning before getting to his feet and walking out of the Chapel. It was about giving praise to the gods, of course, but not only. It was about trust. The gods had always stood by the Hiloi, from the founding of the First Empire, through the First and Second Interregnums and the Second Empire of today. The prayer was about reaffirming the Hiloi's commitment to the covenant between them and their gods, and most importantly trust that as long as that covenant held, nothing could shake the Empire. Alit made his way to the Emperor Hijraska's bridge, pausing only briefly when he came across the ship's Chaplain to kiss his ceremonial ring. He'd barely taken his station as the bridge's nav officer that Crusader Settn, the Hijraska's XO, appeared, prompting the officers on the bridge to murmur a Psalm of Benediction as naval tradition mandated. Settn's face was grim and his second pair of ears flat against the top of his head - a sure sign of the worry that ate him inside. He gestured to Alit first, then to Densk and L'citar, the ship's com and tactical officer respectively. \"Officers, please, come with us. The Captain has requested all Bishop officers to join him for a briefing immediately.\" That was out of the ordinary, so Alit jumped on his feet and almost rushed towards the briefing room. Densk was right behind him, but L'citar was a Byrhilf - a proud client race of the Hiloi - and noticeably slower, so he took more time to join them. Luckily, he was the only non-Hiloi officer on the ship, so everyone else was present and accounted for by the time he arrived, and the Captain started. Captain Iltess was a man of few words, as befitted one born under the sign of the Sorrowful Matron. The Goddess of Victory gave her favorites a keen tactical mind, bravery and leadership, but no interest in making long-winded speeches. That belonged more to the Shrouded Captain's priestts and the Soothing Torch's politicians. Hence, it was no surprise to Alit that the Captain immediately laid out the problem. \"We have received a transmission from Planet DX-2552 Threshold of Redemption, local name Earth. It's not unusual for us, we've received low-intensity waves, echoes of local communications, during our surveys of the sector before. In fact, they even sent out deliberate attempts to contact other races before. But this time it's different.\" Densk shook his whiskers in an interrogative gesture. \"Threshold of Redemption? Isn't that the quarantined Class 3 planet with a sub-FTL civilization? The Heymans?\" \"Humans, actually,\" answered Captain Iltess. \"And they're not sub-FTL. Not anymore. Look:\" As he said these words, the Captain activated the briefing display. A human face sprang up between them all - Alit noted, with mild amusement, that Humans looked almost exactly like two-eyed Ine'l. The small patch of hair on the top of its head was the color of the morning sun, and the rest of its face was pale and hairless, with very pale blue eyes and round pupils. When it started speaking, its high-pitched voice was overlaid with a synthetised translation in Hiloira. \" This is Captain Lyudmila Dimitryevna Karpov, of the UNS Lighthouse. We're broadcasting this on all frequencies to let anyone in the vicinity know that we've just completed our very first hyperjump, or FTL jump, or whatever it is you people call it. There are more of my people preparing more ships, and we're going to meet very soon. I hope this message serves as a sample to work on interpreting our language, that'll be useful for our first meeting. I don't know what kind of galactic community there is out there, but we're excited to meet you all! \" The natural voice under the synthetizer seemed sincere, almost eager. Alit couldn't understand the Captain and XO's reluctance. \"This is good news,\" he ventured. \"Now we can start negotiating with them to integrate them into the Empire, and bring their gods into our fol Before he could finish, Crusader Settn flattened his ears and almost bared his fangs at him, a reprimand so strong that it would usually be reserved for criminal misbehavior or negligence. Stunned, Alit was left wondering what had prompted that outburst. The Captain raised a calming hand and went on. \"While it would generally be a good thing, the Emperor and the Cardinals have determined that Earth is to remain quarantined indefinitely. You see, the Humans have exhibited throughout history a peculiar taste for making war.\" \"That's not exactly unusual, sir...\" Densk dared. And it wasn't. A lot of civilizations encountered by the Hiloi had martial cultures. The Byrhilf had lived in warring clans, the system-spanning Dieppal had established clashing planetary kingdoms, and the avian K'K'kt'K has settled all their bloodline disputes in all-out aerial combat between the males of each involved family. The Hiloi themselves did not relish war, but they knew of it. \"I mean, Captain, our own Sorrowful Matron taught us the ways of war...\" \"Perhaps, but the Sorrowful Matron teaches to strike quickly, cleanly and with resolve at the most valuable objectives. She never taught us savagery and destruction. Take a look at what information we have of their gods - artwork, video and other recovered media...\" More images sprang up from the display. A painting of a city, destroyed by a rain of fire as hapless survivors cowered before the divine. A man, naked but for a loincloth, twisting with pain on a wooden cross as blood dripped down to be collected in a cup, his face raised to the sky in silent prayer. A many-armed being, blue-skinned and dancing on a dead body, holding an assortment of weapons and battle trophies. A priest in a feathered robe plucking out the heart of a bound victim as a sacrifice atop a blood-caked pyramid. Another questioning a screaming, broken victim of torture before leading him to a woodpile and setting it alight. And yet another ululating religious cries in apparent ecstasy as he sliced through the throat of a helpless captive in a desert. The images went on and on until Alit felt sick to his stomach..... And he barely noticed when the Captain started speaking again. \"They worship gods of savagery and bloodthirst, who teach pain and destruction to those who would serve them. Send a message to the Fleet, the Cardinals and the Emperor Himself. Quarantine of Threshold of Redemption is broken. Mobilize all ships. Their gods can not be allowed to join ours - they can not be allowed allowed beyond their planet.

{"original_text": "Announcer Jeremy: Tonight, on The Grand Tour: James is attacked by a Compy. I take a casual off-road drive in a Land Rover. And Richard pees himself. Jeremy: Helloooo Hellooooo, thank you thank you, and welcome to the Grand Tour. Coming to you from Isla Meurta. James: I say doesn't that mean the Island of Death? Jeremy: Yes it does James, but don't think too much about it we've been in worse places. James: Like what, exactly? I saw an actual Dinosaur as we came in on the Engine Helicopter. Four feet and a giant gaping mouth. Hammond: Looked rather like Margaret Thatcher Jeremy: Thank you Richard. No that was a herbivore, and we like herbivores, they don't try to eat us. Richard: Wait hold on how do you know it was a herbivore? You are no expert on dinosaurs sir. In fact you are an expert on nothing. Why are we here? Jeremy: Hammond we are here because your lawyer called the Producers and informed them that you now own this park, and the Producers saw an opportunity. Richard: Wait hold on, I own this now? They didn't tell me that. Jeremy: No they were waiting to see if you got eaten first. James: May I just point out that while the dinosaur we saw when we first landed was in fact a Diplodocus and thus a herbivore, there are signs on this map I've just been handed by the Producers which clearly say Tyrannosaurus Rex pens and Velociraptor Field. These are not..... Jeremy: Yes yes, that's all well and good James, but nobody cares about what you're saying because it's boring. We have been given a challenge. We are to, in a word, survive. We will make our way from this welcome center, through the Raptor fields, past the T-Rex pen, and lastly finish the tour at the exit gates here at the ferry dock. And we will be doing so in these: Richard you'll be driving a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee. James you shall be driving a 1988 Toyota Land Cruiser, and I shall be driving a 2001 Land Rover. Mine of course has more power, because I asked for the most powerful one. James: They all look hideous. Jeremy: Blame Hammond for that, he owns this place now this is his paint scheme. Richard: Wait you can't blame me for this I've just found out I own the place. And don't touch that, that looks expensive to fix. Announcer Jeremy: So we set off on our tour of the island. The Producers gave each of us a flare gun and a package of bear spray, along with a map. James wanted to lead the way but I quickly determined that he was going too slowly so I chose an opportune moment to surge ahead. James: Clarkson you pillock, we have no idea what's ahead of us, slow down! Richard: Yes slow down Jeremy, you might crash into my new park and if you do you're paying for the damages. Jeremy: Hammond if I crash into anything it will just be petrol in a few years so look on the bright side, you've got a future in OPEC! Announcer Jeremy: Everything was going smoothly under my direction when suddenly things took a turn for the worse. James:..... of course this entire park appears to be fabricated from plants and animals that evolved millions of years apart, and could never have existed the same time. That plant over to our right for example is from the Triassic era, while that small dinosaur up ahead would appear to have been from the Tithonian age..... Announcer Richard: James was then attacked by a large number of small dinosaurs. The Toyota was up to the task. James: Get away from me you little bast...... Jeremy: Everything ok back there James? I accidentally bumped a gate open a few minutes ago, I trust everything is progressing normally? James: Clarkson you cock, you've let some dinosaurs out into the wild and they've attacked my truck. My tires have been eaten by some sort of acid. Richard: What do you mean you bumped a gate open Jeremy? If you've damaged my park I'm going to have it taken from your pay. Announcer Jeremy: We progressed through the park, James with a new tire and horribly scarred paint job that actually improved the look of his Toyota. As we approached the Raptor portion of the journey Richard began to show signs of sluggishness. Jeremy: Something wrong with your Jeep Richard? You seem to be falling behind. Richard: No, no nothing wrong with the Jeep. I just keep feeling like we are being watched. James: Of course we're being watched there are cameras all over the place. Richard: No, I think there's something out there. Announcer Jeremy: Hammond was right. His natural instincts as a small animal that survived by sensing when hunters were tracking him were showing through. James: Come on Richard. Everything is behind a fence. Unless Jeremy has broken another gate. Jeremy: I merely grazed that one thank you very much. Richard: Grazed it? Going 50 MPH? Jeremy: Oh cheer up Hammond, look at all this magnificent land, all of it yours. Richard: Not after you get through with it, you're destroying it piece by piece. And what was that noise? Announcer James: That noise was in fact, a Raptor jumping onto the roof of Richards Jeep. James: Wow, what an excellent example of a Velociraptor. Flash it with your high beams Richard. Richard: Ahhhhhhhhhhh Jeremy: Hammond control yourself. The Producers wouldn't send us out here in the wild if they thought we could come to harm. Use your bear spray, I'm sure it will work. Richard: Ahhhh, the cap is broken, the cap is broken. Here we go, and ahhhhOhh god I've sprayed myself. I've sprayed myself. And peed myself if I'm honest. James: It's worked, the bear spray is driving the Raptor away! By Jove Hammond! Announcer Jeremy: Having survived the Raptors and the devious Compys, we now made our way into the dragons den of all lions dens. The Tyrannosaurus Rex pen. All of us were more than willing to proceed past this point in the tour but the Producers insisted. Jeremy:..... And so you see the Land Rover is simply superior to anything else on the road. Look at what we've been through so far. My Land Rover has managed to suffer nothing but a few dents in the bumper. Hammond's Jeep is a mess of urine feces and bear spray, which I'm sure will take forever to clean and the roof is barely holding up. James Land Cruiser is of course the indestructible truck but even it could not escape this tour unscathed. Richard: Jeremy you've gone off the road. Jeremy you're on the wrong path. Jeremy: That's ok, my Land Rover can handle anything. I know what I'm doing, I'm going to race you both to the dock. James: You win Jeremy, come back please. You're headed into the T-Rex pen itself. It's marked off limits. Jeremy: No no, I will have none of your nonsense James May. They could not have a fully grown T-Rex on this island, it's too small. It would starve. My Land Rover can out race anything else on this island, including you're two pitiful excuses for 4x4s. Announcer Richard: And with that we shut up and let him go. We could always find a new co-host. Chris Evans isn't doing anything. Jeremy: I may have erred when I said they couldn't have a full grown T-Rex on this island. Because I am stuck right now in a ditch. A ditch that looks remarkably like a footprint. And I don't know if I can get out of it. Time to switch to sport mode. And now press the fiddly little button, and here we go....no no that didn't do it. I'll have to engage the Terrain Management system and switch it to MudRuts. There we go and..... hahah yes we are free! Britain is gloriously victorious once again! Announcer Jeremy: I shouldn't have been so happy. I might have been out of the ditch but my efforts to gain freedom had been noticed. Jeremy: Oh my god what is that? Must go faster. Land Rover don't fail me now! James: Jeremy scientists estimate that T-Rexs can only reach a top speed of 40 kilometers per hour! You can do it Clarkson! Announcer Richard: As we rounded the last bend to the docks we could see Jeremy in his Land Rover being chased by a T-Rex. Richard: It's almost got you Jeremy, turn hard right! James: Yes, lets see what turns better, a Land Rover or a T-Rex. Clarkson: Now is really not the time James! Announcer James: In fact it was. Clarkson's sharp turn was in fact the difference, and as we boarded the ferry, our cars full of mud and our own biowaste, we couldn't help but thank goodness that dinosaurs couldn't fly. Announcer Jeremy: And on that Bombshell, gooodnight! edit: Thank you all for the kind words. I saw the story right in front of me as soon as I saw the topic. Brilliant suggestion. And I changed gasoline to petrol. Because of COURSE it would be petrol. edit 2: Wow, thanks for the gold.

{"original_text": "He sat motionless in the car, eyes fixed on the house opposite. The house was in darkness, no light save for the pale illumination of the moon bathing the street in an eerie whitewash. The large house sat detached from any other on the street, it's large expanse of verdant garden surrounding it like a moat bordered by a low chain link fence. He glanced at the digital segment display clock embedded in the dash, the numbers glowing an ethereal green, momentarily before returning his gaze to the house. Beds of brightly pigmented flowers lined the pathway to the front door and dotted the lawn, a sea of purples, yellows, and reds. A great silver birch tree dominated the scene, rising nearly as tall as the two storey house's slate tiled roof, it's bark gleaming in the moon's glare, matching the house's whitewashed wood panels in luminance. He grabbed the white cigarette box from the passenger seat, opened it, and plucked a cigarette fluidly, placing it between his lips loosely and throwing the box back onto the seat. A click echoed through the silence of the car as he pushed the cigarette lighter into the socket. Moments later it popped back out, the smell of burnt dust accenting the air. He picked it up and brought the glowing orange coil to the end of the cigarette and lit it. Placing the lighter back in the socket he inhaled deeply on the freshly lit cigarette, the tip glowing a deep red as he did so. Nearly time he thought. The exhalation filled the car with smoke, a thick yellowish haze which made him crack a window to ensure a perfect line of sight on the house. Nothing could go wrong tonight, this was his one shot. The cigarette shortened as the man waited until finally he flicked it from the window, the used butt smouldering on the asphalt. Now was the time, he thought to himself as he stared into his reflection in the mirror, an empty gaze meeting his own. The car door swung open and the man purposefully stepped out. He stood for a moment, hand resting on the door frame, whilst he surveiled the area one last time. Still as the grave. He might've chuckled had the task ahead not been facing him. Striding forward he flung the door behind him shut, the dull thud the only sound in the still night air. It was a cool night, not that it mattered, it had to happen regardless of the weather. A ball of mist hung around his mouth as he exhaled, only to be displaced as he strode forwards, crushing the still-warm cigarette butt beneath his heel as he passed. Stepping up onto the kerb his black dress shoes grated lightly on some loose gravel kicked up no doubt by some passing car. The concrete slabs that lead to the door seemed of the purest white under the bright night sky. Each step brought him closer to the house, his own plan ringing in his ears; kill them, no witnesses. He approached the door and extended his hand towards the unembellished know. His hand hovered an inch away as he weighed up his options. Turning on his heel he stepped down from the porch and headed to the back of house. The back garden was much the same as the front, kept neatly and tended to with much love. A wooden shed stood in the back right corner. He eyed it with curiosity before snapping back to the task at hand. A few cinderblock steps led up to the screen door and he took them silently, unlatching the screen door's length of string from it's makeshift hook and loop configuration. He tried the handle but it yielded no results. Not to be deterred he brought a small cloth roll out of his pocket and laid it out on the top step. An assortment of slim hooked, curved, and straight metal lock picks lined the beige linen. He selected two with a deftness only from years of experience, and put the first into the lock. He tested the pins in the lock gingerly before slotting the tension wrench in, pushing the line again, and twisting. The door swung open, he picked up his tools, pocketed them and went in. It took him a moment to adjust to the absolute darkness inside the house, but before long he could identify a kitchen as the room he was in. A pine table adorned with a red and white checkered water resistant tablecloth stood in the centre of the room. He walked by, running the fingertips of his left middle and ring fingers along the cool surface, focused solely on the doorway ahead of him. Inside the house he could see no doors closed, a godsend for finding his target he thought. Stepping through the doorway he followed the corridor into the main hallway of the house, walking parallel with the steps until he reached their foot where he stopped. Listening closely for a minute he could hear nothing. Could it be that they weren't home? No. No, he'd done far too much research for that to be true. Crouching low he began to ascend the staircase, one step at a time, his shoe making little noise on the strip of carpet running down the middle of the stairs. He stopped at the top. This was it. Finally. Now he just had to carry out his plan like in so many dreams before. He new exactly where to find them. Stepping towards the only closed door he began breathing heavily. He twisted the doorknob and swiftly opened the door, still maintaining silence, though now his movements buzzed with a nervous energy. There, in the otherwise empty double bed, the rapist. Two giant strides and the man was upon his prey. Straddling him on the bed his hands clamped down, crushing his target's windpipe. The shock woke the sleeping man and he began to struggle, hands clawing at his assailant's forearms, torso bucking in an attempt to throw his attacker. Neither man was any larger than average, neither particularly muscular yet the assailant could not be moved, his grim determination set in his eyes, dead in the dim light. As the last ounce of oxygen bled from every cell in the man's body a surge of strength coursed through him, a last ditch attempt to stay on this planet. The two went tumbling off the bed and clattered onto the floor, rolling one on top of the other, each trying to maintain dominance. They traded punches in between grapples, neither willing to relent. The attacker, only slightly larger, used his size to his advantage, sitting on the other man's stomach and swinging wildly at his face. Each hit made a sickening thud and a occasionally even a slight cracking sound. After several minutes of constant abuse the victim lay bloodied and in laboured breaths. The attacker stopped to catch his breath, and in doing so was caught off guard. The man threw his assailant off him and into the wall behind him, stumbling to his feet he threw his entire body weight into a shoulder slam pinning the attacker to the wall by his throat. The drywall cracked behind the attacker and the other man fell backwards onto the bed, keeping himself from falling with a single shaking arm. The attacker stayed slumped back against the wall and coughed, a metallic taste tinged his mouth as he spat and saw blood. The rage boiled within him again. He stepped to the battered form in front of him, it's face barely distinguishable in the dark, though the blood stains on the skin stood out clearly. He reached out a hand, grabbing the man by the collar of his pyjama top, and threw him with all his strength into the ground. He stamped on his skull, again and again, he could feel no more movement but he wouldn't stop until he was sure. From the corner of his eye he saw a waist-high wooden cabinet leaning against the wall. Perfect. He dragged it along the wall to be next to the man on the floor, it's weight deceptive for the size. With the faintest trace of a smile he put all his strength into tipping it. The crunch was sickening and the mess on the floor worse, his victim's head now split and flattened. The dark red blood seeped into the pores of the wood between which the head had been sandwiched. Chunks of everything this man had been squelched underfoot as the killer walked towards the door, the puddles of blood splashing onto his ankles as he walked. As he reached the doorway, head spinning with the delirium of finally killing the rapist he'd planned the death of for so long, his stomach turned to ice and his heart froze. A pair of clear blue eyes looked up at him. Illuminated by a ray of moonlight was the tear-streaked face of a young girl, porcelain skin contrasting long brown hair, reaching down to her pink nightie, teddy bear in hand. The rapist had been a father, he had been a person. So dead set on retribution the man had been he hadn't even considered there being a person behind the villainous cretin. Yet here stood the furthest from that possible, here stood innocence and beauty, here stood happiness and life. Here stood a witness. \"Daddy?\" she whimpered. No witnesses, he thought.", "text_perturb": "He sat motionless in the car , eyes fixed on the house opposite word. The house was in darkness , no light save for the wan illumination of the moon bathing the street in an eerie whitewash. The declamatory house sat detached from any other on the street , it 's declamatory expanse of verdant garden surrounding it like a moat bordered by a low chain link fence.

He grab the white cigarette box from the passenger seat , opened it , and plucked a cigarette fluidly , placing it between his lips loosely and throwing the box back onto the seat. A suction stop echoed through the silence of the car as he pushed the cigarette lighter into the socket. Moments later it popped back out , the smell of burnt out dust accenting the air. He picked it up and add the glowing orange coil to the end of the cigarette and lit it. Placing the lighter back in the socket he inhaled deeply on the freshly lit cigarette , the top glowing a deep red as he did so. Nearly sentence he thought. The exhalation filled the car with smoke , a thick yellowish haze which made him crack a window to ensure a perfect line of sight on the business firm. nil could go wrong tonight , this was his one shot. The cigarette shortened as the man waited until finally he flicked it from the window , the used butt smouldering on the mineral pitch. Now was the time , he thought to himself as he stared into his reflection in the mirror , an empty gaze assemble his own. The elevator car door swung open and the man purposefully stepped out. He stood for a moment , handwriting resting on the door frame , whilst he surveiled the area one last time. Still as the grave accent.

The old wooden door was slightly ajar, Emerson drew his pistol and pushed inside. The cabin smelled like wet rot and butchered meat. Bile rose in his throat, not because of the smell, but because he knew what it belonged to. Floor boards creaked underneath his feet as he walked toward a closed door on the back wall. With each step the buzzing grew louder. He pressed his shoulder against the door and took a deep breath. Gently he pushed the door open holding his pistol at the ready. A young woman sat in a folding metal chair, tattoo gun held in her hand. \"Miss, I'm Special Agent Emerson. I'm here to help you,\" Emerson said calmly lowering his pistol. She lifted her head, her wide blue eyes met Emerson's, they were a mixture of fear, confusion, and anger. \"Why do I need help?\" she asked genuinely perplexed. Emerson took a cautious step forward and held his hand out for her to take. \"Just come with me please, it's not safe here.\" She nodded, dirty strands of blonde hair fell into her face. \"Where did this come from?\" she asked Emerson turning her arm so he could see it.

The majority of humanity is stupid anyways, I doubt they could come up with something better if they racked their brains for 24 hours straight. It's one of the reasons I hate humanity, god are they stupid. I'm one of the very few that are capable of functioning normally. Memes, however, memes are perfect. I feel this deep connection with them, especially Pepe. He shows his emotions and he isn't afraid of anything. I think about him sometimes when I'm feeling down, which happens a lot here in prison. God, I shouldn't even be here. The judge didn't listen to my side of the story. Goddamn humans. I kill the stupidest to save the sanity of those like me, and draw memes on their backs to accompany them to heaven, or whatever it is that they believe in. It's very humane, if you ask me.

At the tender age of two, I was already scraping craters out of our front lawn - something my father found amusing, despite my mother's furious stares. He was a man of discovery, always tinkering away at something or other in his garage workshop, and I took to his example from the beginning. By age eleven, I had finished the tunnel system underneath our backyard, complete with sleeping quarters and a dining room. My father beamed as I rushed from entrance to exit, showing off my hard work. That night, my mother put her foot down. They shipped me off to Winghamton Prep shortly after that. Mother thought it would knock some sense into me - get me to see that there was more to life than digging holes - but she could not have been more wrong.

I heard my name whispered during lulls in lunchtime conversation: Gary Parsons, Master of the Underground. Everyone wanted to see my work. For the first time since the day I showed my father the house passages, I was happy. The structural collapse of Barclay Hall put an end to that. There was never supposed to be a party in the tunnels; the popular crowd took what they thought was theirs and paid the price.

What the World Government was, was something akin to the world equivalent of what had once been the Congress in the United States, before its citizens, finally fed up with the political corruption that had run so rampant that it was openly talked about, even in the news media, had all but revolted, refusing to support their congressional appointees, and calling for its abolishment. Not that the media had cared at all about that tidbit of history. They were much more interested in the particulars of the Ark Project, and in trying to figure out just why it was that the World Government had been so secretive about it. To the media, secrets were meant to be exposed, especially if they were government secrets, and since they were World Government secrets, the media believed that there shouldn't be any secrets they weren't privy to. It didn't take too long before the major outlines of the Ark Project were brought to light; it wasn't a huge secret that prison over-crowding was becoming a problem the world ' round, that many of the prisons - even the low security ones - were seriously overcrowded, in some cases so much so that the prisoners slept in shifts, so that it could be said that each prisoner had a bed to sleep in. The Ark Project, the media managed to uncover, was an idea conceived during a number of meetings of the World Government, in order to discuss, and then come up with a solution, to the world's prison overcrowding situation. The solution, the outline identified, was two-fold: the first was to find a way to make productive assets of the prisoners, rather than keep them contained in prisons in almost inhumane conditions, and the second was to use the volunteer prisoners in a colonization project. There had been a few manned trips to Mars already, and there were still few moons orbiting Saturn and Jupiter that were candidates for remote stations to be put together, and so it was decided that the volunteer prisoners would be the ' test subjects'to build those stations.

In school they told us it's supposed to be one of the oldest cities in the country. It's the oldest I know of. It has a over a million people, 50 schools and universities combined, 14 Halo department stores, and a lot more. Best of all though, it has an abandoned school from over 100 years ago that me and my buddies sneak into every Saturday. Nobody knows it, but the sewer that runs through the town and under Aurora Park has a connection to it. We sneak in through a manhole in the park and leave whenever we want. The school is called Alexandra's School of Engineering and it used to be some sort of hub of technology before the world around us was built. I can't imagine what things would have been like before Northern Light existed, but I imagine it was not very interesting and maybe it was dark without the city's lights. Usually my buddy Julius and I spent an hour hoverboarding up and down the old engineering hill where all of the graduate students built their models. Its like a monument and it's better than any terrain park I've ever seen outside, back in Northern Light. The school itself was like a giant domed colosseum of buildings. There were a few lights up on top that were still on, giving the place the feel of about 8 PM in Northern Light, the time when they dim the city lights. Somedays our group goes exploring instead. We often don't venture too far into anywhere since there aren't very many functional lights left and it can get a little spooky. On Halloween of this year our friend Casey was turning 15 and he told us he would go deeper into the school than we'd ever been. He wasn't going to be afraid anymore. He had a perfect setup too. There was a cam on his helmet for streaming to us, thanks to the signal boosters he would drop along the way. He had a Neverdie light built for tunneling companies (a light supposedly so efficient that as long as you are moving some every hour, will never die). He would ride his hoverboard along, going through every hallway he could find and if he ever got lost he had his VR goggles set up to guide him back along the trail of virtual breadcrumbs. The whole thing was perfect. We were finally going to get to see the parts of the school we were too afraid to go to before. Well that was the plan anyways. Unfortunately, fearless Mikey K. joined us that day and he rarely let anyone get the better of him. He had already talked about joining Casey, and then Julius went ahead and dared him to ride along. So Mikey went too with no more than the usual gear we carry, which is just a phone (a phone which doesn't even get reception in the depths of the school without signal boosters). Five minutes into their endeavor Casey had already ditched Mikey and was exploring everything we always wanted to see. We mostly forgot about Mikey since we couldn't take our eye off of the stream, but every once in a while one of us got a bad feeling and asked, \" Do you think Mikey's okay? \" Nobody ever responded and we just kept watching. After two hours, Casey was back out in front of the school and we couldn't stop talking about all of the things we'd seen. He'd found tons of old tech for us to play with and even an old mechanical laptop with its ancient charging cable. After the initial excitement died down a bit Casey looked around for Mikey. \" Where's Mikey at, guys? \" he asked. \" I figured he'd run back out right away after I ditched him. \" \" He never came out. \" Julius said. \" I don't think anybody knows what to do. \" \" Shit, guys! \" he yelled. \" Are you kidding? What are you doing, we have to find him! \" \" Yeah, \" I said, \" but we don't have all the gear. You're the only one prepared enough to go. \" \" Are you kidding me? We'll just go in pairs, we aren't leaving Mikey in there. God, sounds like you guys already gave up on him. \" And that was the last of that conversation. We paired up and trekked inside. I went with Julius, Casey went with his little brother, and our other buddies Pete and Suds paired up as well. Unfortunately, there wasn't any good way for us to stay connected. Each group took two of Casey's boosters, but if we really split up it would be hard to get very far and keep connected. After half an hour of searching with Julius he told me he had to take a whiz. We'd been to several rooms Casey hadn't and had a wing left that nobody had been too before. We also didn't end up having any connection to any of the others. The plan was to meet back out front after an hour just in case. The part of the school we were in was the structure that contained the buildings for most of the classes and offices. There were various creepy courtyards full of mostly decayed plants, locker rooms, and gyms with equipment that must have been for keeping fit.

I went inside and saw the same dead plants with their withered leaves, untouched by time. After a moment, I saw a hole in the ground by an old dead tree.

{"original_text": "January 22, 2016. Today's the day. Again. As Jim looked at the date on his computer he couldn't help but feel anxious. He had been here a few times before, yet each time he was filled with a sense of dread. What if it didn't work? Well, he actually knew exactly what would happen if it didn't work. He'd wake up again. The real question was what if it did work. \"So let's run it through one more time.\" said Janet. \"We only have 30 minutes until the heart attack.\" One more time. As if that would help. He had run this plan through his head for centuries, and while Janet was aware of the plan and the stakes, she had no way of knowing she had as well. \"It's not that complicated Janet. In a minute I will step into the chamber, and hopefully, turn into a Popsicle.\" And not be groundhog'd any longer, he thought. He could only imagine it, a world past January 22, 2016. Who knows when he would wake up. The further in time the better. He would have more to work with that way. He could only hope that someone found a way to wake him up before his body decomposed to the point that the universe considered him dead. Then he would just wake up yesterday and have to try again. He thought back to a time when that very thing brought him excitement. The possibilities had been endless. At first he only fixed trivial things. A date gone wrong turned into a blossoming relationship. Failed lottery ticket purchases had turned him into a billionaire. Missed opportunities had turned into open doors all around him. The world was his playground. All it took was the pull of a trigger. Then he had realized the full potential of his groundhogging. He could go back till his very birth and relive his life however he wanted. Over and over. He had been the President of the United States, a world famous musician, an evil genius that ruled most of the world, a philanthropist that changed humanity for the better, a hermit who never left the house, a man who just wanted to die. Over and over and over his life played before him. People and places turned to mere tools that he could use and then restore. As long as he stayed within March 4, 1965 and January 22, 2016. It turns out the only thing he couldn't change was his genetics. No matter how healthy he ate or how in shape he was, his heart would give out today, and he would groundhog.

With the last 3 lifetimes of work surrounding him, mainly a state of the art cryogenic chamber not expected to be a reality for at least a few more centuries, he wondered what his future would look like.

Hell, there may even be someone else like him out there that could help him. \"Alright Jim, everything is dialed in and ready to go. Ready on your word.\" Janet said.

Once he laid down he heard Janet type into her computer and then the hiss of a motor near his head closed the chamber door. \"Can you hear me?\" Janet said. \"Loud and clear\" He replied over the intercom. \"Alright, we have 10 seconds until freeze.\" She said with a steady voice. \"Thank you for everything Janet. I couldn't have done this without you.\" Jim said. \"That's why you will make sure there is a statue of me in a big city in the future. Right?\" She said as the sound of the chamber's freezing cells started up. Right, he thought. An instant later everything went black. He felt the soft plush of a pillow under his head as he slowly came to. He didn't dare open his eyes.

Well , he actually knew exactly what would pass off if it did n't work. He 'd rouse up again. The real question be what if it did work. `` So let 's run it through one more clip. `` pronounce Janet. `` We only possess 30 minutes until the heart attack. `` One more than time. As if that would help. He had run this program through his head for centuries , and while Janet was aware of the program and the stakes , she had no way of knowing she had as well. `` It 's not that complicated Janet. In a minute I will step into the bedroom , and hopefully , turn into a Popsicle. `` And not be groundhog 'd any longer , he thought. He could only imagine it , a public past January 22 , 2016. Who knows when he would wake up. The farther in time the better. He would have more to work with that means. He could only hope that someone discover a way to wake him up before his body decomposed to the point that the universe considered him dead. Then he would just wake up yesterday and have to try out again. He thought back to a time when that rattling thing brought him excitement. The possibilities had embody endless. At first he only when fixed trivial things. A escort gone wrong turned into a blossoming relationship. Failed lottery tag purchases had turned him into a billionaire. Missed opportunities had turned into opened doors all around him. The public was his playground. All it took was the pull of a induction. and then he had realized the full potential of his groundhogging. He could go back till his very birth and live over his life however he wanted. Over and over. He had been the President of the United States , a world famous player , an evil genius that ruled most of the world , a philanthropist that changed humanity for the better , a hermit who never left the house , a man who just wanted to die. Over and over and over his life run before him. People and places turned to mere tools that he could use and and so restore. As long as he stayed within mar 4 , 1965 and January 22 , 2016. It turns out the only thing he could n't change was his genetic science. No matter how healthy he deplete or how in shape he was , his heart would give out today , and he would groundhog.

He kept thinking as he laid his dead body down into the machine. Once he laid down he heard Janet type into her computer and then the razzing of a motor near his head closed the chamber door. `` Can you hear me ?

Approximately 3,000 are currently thought to exist in the wild. Since prehistory, the Brindled Dwarf has inhabited the ancient Schwartzwald (Black Forest) of Northern Bavaria.

Until the arrival of humans in Europe, its preferred meal was the giant Megalocerus or, when available, the cave bear. The arrival of Homo sapiens,\" however, initiated one of the bloodiest and most significant events in natural history. We know from cave drawings that the initial years of Cro-Magnon in central Europe were intensely violent. Their migration from the Middle East into Sub-glacial Europe was met by a variety of megafauna with whom these early people had no previous experience: not only dragons but also giants, trolls, and werewolves stalked the forests of Bavaria. In time, each of these were subdued by human ingenuity and weapons - all but the dragons. Hunters and those who went out foraging were picked off easily. Cave art from this period depicts Dwarf dragons springing from trees, charging through the undergrowth, and disemboweling entire families. The nightly terror experienced by Paleolithic humans must have been dreadful indeed. Huddled together, they would have heard the telltale snorting and chirping just paces away from the cave entrance. Occasionally, the darkness would be lit up by bursts of green flame, illuminating the terrified faces of those around them. Their only weapon against dragons was the longspear, which was, of course, only effective at short range. And, once at short range, there was very little hope of survival. The advent of the throwing spear, followed by the bow and arrow, marked a turning point in the war between Man and Draconis. Suddenly, man was able to project weapons beyond his own vulnerable body, driving the dragons back into the hills and wresting control of the forest from its ancient lords. By the Middle Ages, passage through the Black Forest was considered relatively safe and the population of Draconis had thinned dramatically. It is assumed by most natural historians that thus began a period of tense avoidance by both parties, which lasted until the present day. There is, however, the matter of the Beastmounters. There exist small, isolated communities of forest folk who claim to be in peaceful contact with Dwarf dragons - and, in fact, claim dominion over them. These individuals describe subduing wild dragons, approaching them slowly while casting various spells of appeasement and self-protection. The dragons, in turn, lower themselves to the ground and allow the spellcaster to climb on their backs. A specially-forged chain of unknown metal is slipped over the dragon's head and off they go, sprinting into the night. Dwarf Brindles do not fly, but rather run at tremendous speeds through the trees and across meadows, splashing through creeks and leaping over fallen logs. For reasons naturalists are still trying to work out, the dragons always return Beastmounters to their homes after these nightly forays, alone and unharmed.

Dwarf Brindles do not fly , but rather run at tremendous speeds through the trees and across meadows , splashing through creeks and bound over fallen logs. For reasons naturalists are still trying to work out , the dragons always give back Beastmounters to their homes after these nightly forays , alone and unharmed. No scientific reason has yet been given for why this strange truce should take for , but it always does - Man and Dragon racing together through the forest primeval. ", "label": 1}

{"original_text": "Hi. I hate you. I hate the way you made me feel. I hate the way you've dug into my brain. I hate everything about you. I thought I got over you two years ago. It was the strangest thing, I was walking alone down a bridge in Venice, and I realized, I didn't miss you. I missed loving you. And I thought that was that. Needless to say, I was wrong. When we ran into each other after I came back from studying abroad, and you were with Mr. \"Save You From Yourself\" Superman Jones, I thought I would be fine. Instead, I remembered all those times you cheated on me while we were together and I secretly wished you were cheating on him too. Fuck that guy. And fuck you too. Seriously. Yes, I know, getting into a relationship with you was my decision, and at the time, I thought it would work out. I got sucked into the allure of \"love will prevail.\" Well, now I know. It fucking doesn't. Love doesn't prevail, and anyone who says so is a dirty fucking liar. Mostly you. \"Ohhh, I don't care that you're poor. I don't need fancy things.\" Then why did you want to follow your \"foodie\" heart and eat at these places you know I couldn't afford? I work minimum wage. Minimum fucking wage. And you know what? I've been poor my whole life. So I would have really, really liked to save some money for a change. But no, I blew several paychecks on you, and you decided to break up with me for what? Because I was being nice? Because I was putting some honest to god effort into our relationship and you were being too much of a pissy bitch to notice or care? Oh, by the way. Thanks for returning the effort. Like, I really appreciated the way you called me when I was visiting my sister so you could bitch (SURPRISE, SURPRISE) for three hours about that chick who you honestly had no business having beef with. Oh my God, she's smart and pretty and she's dating your former best guy friend, who you no longer talk to, because what the fuck is wrong with you, woman? When you talk about her you really make me appreciate how much of a jealous cunt you are. And you wonder why my friends hate you? Actually, NEWS FLASH. They didn't hate you. Because for whatever reason, your crazy only pops out when we're alone. It's amazing. Everyone else pretty much thought you were normal. Hell, I even thought you were normal. What a young and misguided youth I was. That's probably why I thought it was a good idea to try again. I loved you. I loved the way you made me feel. I loved the way you dug into my brain. I loved everything about you. Even through all of that crazy shit you put me through, I loved you. I remember when we first met, at some random karaoke bar through mutual friends and we were joking about stupid shit and how we were totally meant to be together and how somehow it finally fucking happened and you dragged me through the mud for nearly a year. I remembered all that and I thought it was worth it. So I let you back in. I trusted you because I thought we could put it past us, because I genuinely fucking believed you when you said you changed. You spoon fed me straight bullshit out of a playbook of cliches and I swallowed it because I wanted so much to go back to that time when we had just begun dating where I asked you if you loved me and all you did was look me straight in the eyes and kiss me gently on the lips. And that didn't fucking happen. This time it wasn't Superman Jones, it was motherfucking Batman Johnson. Swooping out of the night to be your knight.

{"original_text": "It was Silvia's and my 2nd anniversary dating together. Despite a really rocky start and some strange moments, things seemed to be going really well. Our interests, temperments, and even our crazy sides matched. We met at an anime convention. She was looking over the latest re-releases of Battle Princess Mintaka. I don't know why, but I felt compelled to strike up a conversation. Well, it was probably the fact she was a fiery red-haired, piercing green eyed, freckled, glasses wearing, anime-interested young woman with a figure that my baser instincts had only theorized could exist. I may have been a goofy, tall and bulky dork..... But..... I have a near encyclopedic knowledge of Battle Princess Mintaka on my side. Fate may have been throwing me a pity softball on this one, but damned if I wasn't going to swing for the fences on it. So..... Two years, a whole host of convention going, and a lot of learning experiences..... We were still together and I didn't see anything stopping us. She got her dissertation together and defended it. With the Ph. D. in hand and some noted papers published, the university couldn't wait for her to apply for some open positions they'd been dying to fill. I was able to pull a few strings to get into the IT department with the help of an old friend who managed to find himself there after a big career change. So..... The next big step I figured was seeing if she wanted to move in with me. I managed to get a ridiculous price on a foreclosure property, and I had been living there for some time. Silvia is practically here all the time and the rent for anything nicer than a single bedroom apartment around this town is ridiculous. So, 2nd anniversery, I figured..... Why not ask? We decided to keep it simple this anniversary. Giving some craziness that happened during the first one, that Silvia still doesn't feel comfortable talking about..... Simpler is better. A nice day trip to some parts of the state we hadn't seen before, lunch at some place we found on the web, going over to the theatre to see the new Deadpool movie (Her suggestion, I love this woman), and dinner at the usual nice place we go to went we need a little fancy dining to bring up our spirits. We are hanging out on the couch. She's curled up with a blanket in my arms. She looks happy and content. Seems like a successful anniversary so far. I was tempted to put off asking her about moving in. I really didn't want to give Murphy's Law a chance to throw everything for a loop. But, hell..... You got ta know sometime right? \"Hey, Silvia?\" \"Yes?\" \"I was thinking..... You are over here a lot anyway, you need a place to stay in the future, and well..... We've been together for two years. If you are comfortable with it, I'd really like to see how we are together, living in the same place.\" Okay. Logical reasoning presented, reason for the question revealed, and option to gracefully back out allowed. Worst case probably, \"No, let's give it some more time.\" Best case: \"Hell yes!\" The sudden slight shudder of Silvia snapping to full consciousness and the odd feeling of the room's energy changing was not in any of the predicted outcomes. Oh shit, I'd somehow hit a critical snag. Silvia slowly pushes herself up and sits upright on the couch. The blanket slips away and she just sits there in uncomfortable contemplation. This is not good. She's normally a very confident and expressive woman. Seeing her this subdued and nervous..... This was shades of the last anniversary right here. I'm not going to allow that to happen again. \"Hey, there's no pressure or anything. I just figured it might be something to think about. I think everything is going great between you and me. I've got a place, you are looking for a place. And there's no one else who I could think of that'd make this place more of a home for the both of us. If it's too much to ask, just say so. And we'll think about it later and A meek and saddened voice creeps from Silvia, \"I want to. sniff I really do. I just- I just- I just don't know if you'd accept me.\" Okay. I'm confused. \"Accept you? Have I not accepted you before? I accept you as you are before me. There's nothing I can think of that \"I'm a demon.\" \"A what?\" \"Demon.\" \"You get a bit difficult some times, but you're hardly a Silvia shoots up from the couch, turns around to me, and holds her arms to the sides with tears in her eyes, \"sniff I'll show you. It's best for the both of us to make it quick.\" The facade fades away. Silvia's long red hair, turns a silvery white. Her skin goes from the freckled pale to a gray with darker gray markings. Two swept back horns anchored in the sides of her forehead appear. But as strange as what has changed is, she still has that same figure, that beautful face, and the piercing green eyes that are more radiant than ever. \"You know me as Silvia Carter. I'm..... I'm..... I'm Silvianistria Nostromandeus of the 3rd Order of Orion..... Former servant and advisor to the Battlemistress and Queen of the 3rd Order of Orion Lady Oriana Nox.\" She looks at me, expecting a certain reaction. I gaze into those same eyes. She's scared. It actually all makes sense to me now. We got A LOT to talk about. And she's not the only one with a few secrets to tell, but first things first. I take her hands into mine and never breaking eye contact with hers. I crack that smirk that she hates to love, \"If you are the same woman that was nearly late to her dissertation defense because of an argument with me about how there is no way that Battle Princess Mintaka could have used the Gauntlet of the Guardian to defeat Lord Izo..... Then you are the same woman I've loved and will always love.\" This isn't the reaction she expected. After a brief moment of confusion, I witness one of the few moments she's ever been delighted to be absolutely wrong. She gracefully collapses into an embrace around my neck, one of her horns glances me in forehead with a light thunk. That'll take some getting used to. We hold each other and eventually start airing out all our laundry. A few hours later...... \"So, that's me. Once an undisputed master advisor, mage, and alchemist to one of the Queens to the Dark Realms. Then Queen Nox decided to listen to that idiot Wester and got her aass royally kicked and banished to realms that even the darkest mages dare not even chart. Out of work and trapped on Earth. Thankfully, certain organizations offered me a chance at a life here on this planet with giving them a bunch of insider info.\" \"I always wondered how they got all that info in those Battle Princess Mintaka books.\" \"Yah, I kind of got into them while trying to see how they portrayed all us on the Dark Realm side.\" \"They were pretty kind with your portrayal.\" \"They still cleaned up the rest of the group. Great gods, most of Queen Nox's crew were complete perverts. I was so glad that Lord Izo got absolutely annihilated by Mintaka. He ran back to the Dark Realms and I haven't heard a thing about him since.\" \"Grr..... Fucker deserved it.\" \"You really don't like that guy. Every time that name gets brought up you ALWAYS emit this aura of spite and ire, that I never sense from you any other time.\" Shit. Well..... she's got me. Let's get all the laundry hanging out. \"There's a reason. And as a bonus, it'll prove you right.\" This has her attention now. I feel her leaning in and her eyes trying to decipher what I was going to say. \"The Gauntlet of the Guardian didn't leave Lord Izo and jump to Mintaka.\" \"Yes. Because the Gauntlet will only jump on its own to someone trying to defend who they love and care for in their time of greatest need.\" \"Yes..... Ah..... Those scars on my body, those weren't from electrical arcs. They were I don't get a chance to complete my sentence before Silvia is reaching under my shirt and feeling the various scarring I got a long time ago. \"Holy shit! These are magical blast burn scars! The residual magic is so weak I could never pick it up while maintaining my illusion and shape change spell. Now, I can sense it all..... By the gods! How did you live through this Silvia hands held my right arm. Her fingertips sweep around. She's finally sensing the residual magic of what was on there. \"You wore the..... THE..... Gauntlet of the Guardian?!\" \"Yes.\" \"The bystander that attempted to save Mintaka and friends in issue 126 where Mintaka finally confronts Lord Izo?\" \"Me.\" \"The gauntlet went to?\" \"Me.\" \"Because WHO were you defending?\" \"My little sister.\" \" ............!!!\" \"Yes.\" I think it'll be a LONG while before I see that degree of shock, confusion, and bewilderment in Silvia's face. And I really hope I'm not the one to cause it next time. I see her bite her lower lip and flash a concerned look my way. \"Do you still want me to come over to your family's place this Thanksgiving? That might be REALLY awkward..... and possibly dangerous.\" \"Don't worry. My sister wasn't good with the sensory powers before, and she hasn't used them in at least ten years. We should be fine.\" \"But, what about Horus her magical cat?!\" \"Don't worry. Horus and I go back. I've helped him out a number of times. He'll keep it quiet.\" Plus, the bastard owes me a big one after nearly getting caught by the magical equivalent of the FBI trying to move his stash of Star Hemp to a new safe place. We both lay on the couch, back to that comfortable and content point again. \"So..... you okay with moving in?\" \"Ha. Yes. I'm actually looking forward to it now.\" \"Cool. Got to admit, it was nice getting everything out there.\" \"No kidding. Strange world we live in. I'm just glad I can finally drop the shape change spell around you.\" \"Speaking of which, you wouldn't happen to have THAT uniform still?\" All I am able to get from Silvia is that evil little grin.", "text_perturb": "It was genus silvia 's and my 2nd anniversary dating together.

{"original_text": "OASIS - Day 1, April 22nd, 2065 Alright. We all managed to touch down without any actual problems. Doesn't seem to be any damage on the ship. Landing gear is okay. Still got enough fuel to get back to orbit. Sara is complaining about how warm it is. I kinda agree with her. While we seem to be in an oasis right now, surrounding us all is just desert. I mean, we knew it was dry but the clouds were too thick to make anything out. Anyway. We're gon na check the composition of the oasis plants, then get some rest. 42 hour day tomorrow. 30 of it is sun. Day 3, April 24th, 2065 Okay, so the plants in this area seem to be angiosperms, with apparently wind as the preferred transfer method. Makes sense, there's an almost constant breeze. Don't know where it'd go, though, apart from here. Water is fine and safe to drink. Seems to be a spring. We're getting the fusion engine ready, but until then rationed power. Reason why I'm writing, actually. Long time since I have. I remember my dad telling me that once they used to actually write in classes. Heh, good old days. Tomorrow we're gon na go on an expedition, see if we can get anywhere. We're preparing some buggies to travel about. We'll use liquid fuels for now, while electricity gets set up. Day 4, April 25th, 2065 Okay, so me and Mike are heading out. The rest of the crew is going to take care of setting shit up, while we go dune buggying. As Mike's driving, I can write. Outside the oasis, the temperature picks up a hell of a lot, up by 10 to 15 degrees, at least. It's already something like 80 in the shade. Kinda wishing I stayed back now. At least there's no wind to blow sand in my face. Day 5, April 26th, 2065 Okay, so me and Mike are fucking screwed, along with finding the reason why the wind had dropped. Sandstorms. I swear to god, tornados were fucking everywhere. We set up emergency shelter, and we're kinda waiting it out. The sound of the storm has stopped. Not the storm itself, though. The sand's burying us, I think. Day 7, April 28th, 2065 Finally, it's stopped. We checked the plexiglass windows, and we know for a fact we are buried. 10 feet, I think. seems pretty hard packed. Mike's MacGyvering some kind of drill together, so we can get out. I think the shelter's a loss. There's no way we could get it out. Oh well, time to dig. Day 8, April 29th, 2065 We made it. Oh god, I have never wanted to feel the wind on my face and the warmth again. We spent 20 hours, digging straight up. We got to a point where it was actually raining down, but we didn't give a fuck, we just climbed up and up and up, sand in our hair and eyes, looking for the cloudy sky. We got everything out of the tent. The buggy is a loss. Mike's trying to get the GPS unit to work. I think the cloud layer is interfering. We also sent up a flare, so we'll see what happens. Day 10, April 30th, 2065 Nothing. While we didn't want to climb back down to the tent, we had to during night. It's fucking freezing. The tent keeps some warmth, at least. GPS is down, and the flares are out. I think we're just going to have to hike back the way we came. We did lay down Helium Markers, so that's good. Thank god for all this equipment. We're running low on food, though. Got enough for about a week, now. Water's good, we've got 2 weeks of that. We're gon na start walking soon. Day 11, May 1st, 2065 Okay, so we hiked for about 25 hours, thanks to the sunlight (so fucking hot) and we managed to build some kind of sand igloo for the night (so fucking cold). Our water is really dropping quickly, and we are getting tired, fast. Thank god we found the Helium Markers. Though. I've never been happier to see one of those red and blue motherfuckers. We're following them along, and we've past 15 by now. Mike says we've got about 30 more to go. This is really taking a toll on him. I mean, he's a pretty heavy guy. He's an engineer, not Markel Louis, 2060 Gold Medalist Long Distance Runner. I feel sorry for him. I try to keep him on the up, though. I'm gon na get the sleep I can now, and try to cover as much ground as possible. Day 13, May 3rd, 2065 MOTHERFUCKER. One of those fucking'storm-proof' Helium Markers got snapped. We're fucked. We put a 5km distance between each of them, and the one we were going to was in the middle of a fucking crater. We're gon na try to follow our steps out. This really has Mike down. Shit, he ain't doing well at all. I mean, yeah, he's lost like 15 lbs, but he is losing water way to quickly. I estimated, and our water is only gon na last 2 more days. Off we go, I guess. Day 14, May 4th, 2065 We ran out of food today. I didn't realize till I reached into the bag that was already empty. We only have a few more liters of water, as well. We got back to our previous Marker, and we're camping there for tonight. On the bright side, I found some actual life on this planet! A huge, 10ft long snake, just slithering around, with a HUGE bulb. That was dinner. We both ate well, and turned out the bulb was filled with water. We'll be okay. Day 15, May 5th, 2065 Okay, so we walked. We have a general idea of where we're going. We know that the missing Marker in the crater is 5km away from last night's Marker. We know the one far away is about 7km away. Using some triangulation magic, we found where we had to go. Hopefully this works out. I gave Mike a larger ration of water. Hopefully he stays up. Day 16, May 6th, 2065 It's not there. We couldn't find it. Not even a severed rope. Did we go to the wrong place? Was the crater not actually a Marker point at all? The sandstorm changed this place so much. I have no sense of bearing. Mike's not taking it well. We're kinda lost here. I guess we're gon na hike back to our campsite, I guess. Day 17, May 7th, 2065 We can't find it. We can't. I can't. Oh fuck oh fuck. We can't find our camp. It's gone. We know it's the same area. It looks the same, has the same mountain in the distance, but no Marker, no camp, no fucking nothing. We only have a day worth of food left. We have no more water. I need to find one of those snake things again, or we're dead. Day 20, May 20th, 2065 Mike is on his last stand right now. He can't handle the lack of food, lack of shade, lack of water. Neither can I, but he's suffering. I caught another snake, much smaller this time, and gave it to him. He ate it raw. Right then and there. I was disgusted. And hungry. So hungry. Day 25, May 25th, 2065 Mike's dying. I think that snake he ate was poisonous. he's green, throwing up, and not moving. We can't afford to waste this time. But he'll die tonight. I know it. I wonder what I'm going to do. Day 26, May 26th, 2065 Mike died last night. I was so hungry..... Day 27 I have to keep moving. Can't think on what I did. If I keep moving, maybe I'll find the Oasis, right? Yeah, then I can finally lie back in the shade, sip on that bottle of 20-year-old Royale whiskey I smuggled on. That'd be great. Day 30 Sand. It's everywhere. It's everything. Sand, made of silicon, made of protons and neutrons and electrons, which also make me up. By that logic, I'm sand, right? Day It's really warm today. I think I'll take off my suit. Night It's cold. I buried myself in sand. Still cold. Day 35, 4th June, 2065 I see it! It's in the distance. Fucking finally. Running hurts a hell of a lot, despite me feeling lighter. Fuck, I need to take a shower. At least I've got some great thighs from this walking. Ugh, am I tired. I'll dive in that spring, surprise everyone. About 100 yards away now. Let's go. End Everything is sand. I'm sand. The Oasis is sand. There is no Oasis, just sand. It's so warm, like being in a fuzzy blanket. I'll sleep now. - Holy fuck, 7766 characters of writing. I felt that ending get to me.", "text_perturb": "OASIS - Day 1 , April 22nd , 2065 Alright.

He could tell none of this was real, he'd grown up in real forests, and they were full of the sounds of wind, wildlife, everything had some rhyme or reason for making the sound it did. This place? Even the river didn't make the right sound. It's like they turned the volume of everything down in intensity. It felt unnatural. It made him shiver. \"Outside this place, I could make fire, you know,\" Frank mumbled. \"I once accidentally burned my house down when I was a kid. I was holding a bunch of spent matchsticks that I'd been playing with earlier, and then suddenly they all just burst int Bobby put his finger up to Franks lips. He mouthed'shh' and focused. The sound had changed. It was faint, but he could hear someone moving through the brush somewhere across the river. Last week he could've pinpointed a squirrel a mile away, but somehow in this place he couldn't get his hearing to work right. Must have been the food. \"Wait, what were you saying?\" he whispered suddenly, and locked eyes with Frank. \"I thought you wanted me to shut up.\" \"SHH! Fucking..... just whisper, Frank. For me. I can hear someone out there. They probably can't hear us, but just keep quiet, alright?

Shit, maybe it's Ace, he's always been kind of a big lumbering beast.\" Suddenly, and sure enough, Ace burst from the brush on the other side of the river and rushed into the water, dunking his head and taking long, deep gulps. It didn't seem like he'd spotted them. Just then, something clicked in Bobby's head. \"Frank. Get down from the tree. Ace is in the water. I think if you try hard enough, you can cook him.\" \"What?\" \"We're in here to kill, Frank. I did my job, I spotted someone. Now go do yours.\" \"What? What? My job is to cook the food, Bobby! You're the fighting expert, YOU go down there!\" Frank whispered furtively. Bobby grabbed him by the collar. \"Stick. Your hands. In the river. Cook it up like you were cooking noodles.

It made him throb. `` Outside this place , I could make fire , you know , '' Frank maunder. `` I once accidentally burned my house down when I was a thomas kyd.

You are too large to use such a trinket.\" The human reasoned. \"Interesting...\" I mused. \"What value in such a thing, what could you possibly offer in exchange for a magical ring?\" \"I am not a noble nor royal but anything that you desire that I can produce will be yours.\" The human said sitting crossed legged below my alter.

The human pulled its hair for a moment, obviously taken back by the strange request.

Quickly I began to transform into the form that I have avoided when possible. A tall slender black haired main with pale skin and long red robes. I snatched the ring out of the air and landed softly before the warrior. \"You can use it once I have taken my turn.\" I cackled. Slipping the ring on I immediately meditated on my own form, scales stronger than ever, breath hotter with teeth and claws sharper and longer than before yet years reset to that of young adulthood. I could feel the rings energy flowing through me and I closed my eyes. I felt my body rippling and strengthening..... stiffening? In horror I opened my eyes to see my body slowly changing into gold, from foot up it climbed. I quickly attempted to pull the ring off but my arms were already growing heavy and stiff. I looked to the human with such rage. \"What is this sorcery! I should have known not to trust a human.\" I sputtered. Already my lungs were stiffening and breath was becoming shallow. \"There was no deception on my part wyrm. It is transforming you into what I want the most.

And although Tom took many business trips, Nellie clearly understood this trip was different. She understood that he was never coming home and yet her strength in supporting me was unaltered and altruistic. The months went by and Nellie became my best friend. While our love for Tom initially brought us together, it was force of fate that made me realize Nellie was my saving grace. It was her undying acceptance that pushed my hand into accepting myself, and it was her unfaltering love that provided me with hope. My desire to have children would never leave me but the void was filled by that little black lab, and she gladly played the part of my furry, four legged baby. Almost giddily I bought steaks at the deli, tonight for dinner we would celebrate Nellie's second birthday. I pictured her big brown eyes lighting up when she heard the meat hit the skillet, and her leaning ever so patiently against my leg as I finished cooking it. My joyful daydream quickly diminished as I rounded the corner to my small house. Something felt wrong. Nearing the front door I noticed it was slightly ajar. As my heart began to race I called out to her. My mind panicking, I reassured myself that Nellie would soon come bounding out to greet me; after all she was never one to wander away and was well trained to always stay in the confines of our front yard. My stomach churned as I opened the door and called for her once again. Nothing. The rest of the night was a blur. The thieves had ransacked my home, taking TVs, jewelry and of course what petty cash they could find. As I picked up my belongings I realized that the only missing thing I cared about was Nellie. Why would they take my dog? What were they doing to her? Had she been tired of being left alone while I worked and gladly followed them out of my life? I found myself crippled in my sorrows once again. This time I had nothing left. I had never been part of a family and was not quick to make friends. I had Tom and Nellie; now they were both gone. I found a bottle of whiskey in the cupboard and sat down to drown my sorrows. Hungover and depressed the next day I called into work. They could find someone else to write the news, I had a date with daytime soaps and a bottle of Jack.

It was Nellie, there was no doubt in my mind. I reached out my hand to touch her, as I did she let out a happy whimper. Immediately dropping my journal I kneeled onto the floor to hug her. Tears filled my eyes as I turned to the young man. Trying to find the right words I studied him. He couldn't have been older than 25 but his face bore the marks of many struggles. His over sized clothes reaked of cigarette smoke. He gave me an awkward smile. \"I guess you like dogs huh?\" he half stated, half asked. \"Where did you get this dog?\" was all I could choke out. \"Someone gave her to me, why do you care?\" he seemed agitated by my quick interest and overwhelming love for his dog. As he started to pull on the leash I quickly came gathered my thoughts and backed off a little bit. Nellie nudged my hand again as I asked; \"Sorry I was just wondering where you got this incredible dog?\" His face softened and he relented. \"I used to be a patient here, someone found this poor pup in a drug house. They brought her here as a therapy dog. I don't know if we saved her or she saved me, but cause of her I ain't had any slip ups in 6 months now!\" Just as quickly as my heart had began racing my stomach began to sink.

I go under. For a moment my eyes sting and smart as they adjust to the gloom. Air bubbles stream from my nostrils. I squint and peer out through a fringe of dark eyelashes. It stares back at me.

{"original_text": "The first months were the most shocking ones, afterwards everything calmed down, albeit slowly. The \"aliens\" as we called them at first were very clearly related to us biologically. At least some of them. Some others were completely different, but we didn't meet many of those for obvious reasons. The first step to building a good relationship was learning and teaching our respective languages, albeit they were quite familiar with our earthly tongues. So our groups were mostly taught Amambwe, Lysano, and Thindlurrinni, three of the most common languages of the newcomers. \"Whatever is the reason they are visiting us?\" Anne asked me. \"We don't know yet,\" I replied. Although I had pondered that for quite too long, I couldn't really come to a conclusion. They weren't threatening, they weren't exchanging information -other than linguistic ones, that is. Their coming was unknown to us, but welcome they were. Not that we didn't have groups of nut-jobs walking around the streets demonstrating. But if they had met the \"aliens\" face to face, they'd feel otherwise. These ones were almost exactly like humans, but they radiated an otherworldiness that can't be put down to words. Was it their scrutinising gaze? The fact that they smiled too much? The fact that they could speak our languages almost perfectly? \"Is everything going alright?\" Ansemi asked me. \"Oh, you startled me!\" I replied. \"Yeah, everything's fine.\" The way these..... people? Sure. The way these people could creep up on you was uncanny. They almost made no sound whatsoever. \"I didn't mean to\" he said in Lyseno. \"It is okay,\" I replied in my broken speech which he didn't mock. \"Lilly,\" he said, \"I wanted to ask you something. \"Only if you let me ask you something in return\" I said. \"You know I'm not allowed. Not yet.\" \"Yeah, I know\" I sighed. \"Sure, ask me.\" I could feel Anne's gaze from across the room. \"Would you like to asswinnento with me?\" \"To what?\" I didn't know that word. \"To go out with me. To have a date.\" I pondered for a second. \"I don't think it would be...\" \"Before you refuse, I have an offer to make. If you come, I'll answer as many questions as I can. It's not much, I know. But it will definitely be more than you already know now.\" His smile was disarming. Three hours later, we were sitting in a small restaurant near my university, with small round tables and cozy colours. Whether the music playing was lounge or some kind of jazz, I couldn't tell. Ansemi was handsome as ever, and his attire was impeccable, if only a bit overdressed. Or was I the one who thought this would be more casual. \"So, Lilly,\" he said and drank a sip of wine, \"I guess you have many questions, but so do I. I hope you don't mind.\" \"Not at all,\" I said, as long as you provide me with enough info. \"Shall I go first?\" I said. He nodded. \"Are humans and your people related?\" \"Yes, indeed. We are very closely related.\" \"Is panspermia correct?\" \"That I do not know, but it might as well be. Now it's my turn. Do you like me?\" \"Oh, blunt. Alright, I can play that game.\" I smiled. \"Well \"Are you ready to order?\" asked the young waitress. \"Beef tartare, smoked cheddar, chestnut,\" Ansemi said. I was about to order a cheeseburger, but with that I changed my mind. \"I'll have the same, thanks.\" \"So,\" sighs Ansemi with a big bright smile. \"Yes. Indeed, I can't deny that you're a good-looking fella,\" I reply, without actually answering his question. But it seems it's enough for him. \"Did you come to destroy us or take us out for expensive dinners?\" I asked. He laughed. \"We didn't come to destroy you, no. We have come to build an alliance between our people and yours. And of course, we'll help you technologically.\" \"But you'll want something in return.\" \"Naturally,\" he said, \"but whether or not you do help us, we'll still help you and our alliance won't change nonetheless.\" \"May I ask what it is that you're after?\" \"This is confidential.\" \"I shall never speak of it.\" \"Our people can not reproduce. We shall ask your people's representatives for reproductive cells. We know you already donate male cells, so I don't think it would be that much of a deal.\" \"I don't think so either,\" I frown, \"but then how did you come into being?\" \"My turn to make a question,\" he smiled. \"Have you ever been married?\" \"Yes. Once. It didn't last. He was a bastard.\" You looked at me quizzically. \"I kid! I mean, I was married, yes. But he wasn't a bastard. It just didn't work out. We were too young and too carrier-driven to even notice that our marriage was falling apart. Until, we did. So we ended it.\" He nodded. His questions were always intimate. Mine were never that. So I changed my tactic. \"Do you have a family back there, on your planet?\" \"No, not really. I have a clan though,\" he said. \"A clan of brothers and sisters. Most of them work as farmers now though.\" \"What do they do there, make crop circles? \" I asked, saying the last word in English, for I didn't think there might be an equivalent. \"Excuse me?\" he asked. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" I said, I didn't mean to offend.\" \"No, I mean. I don't know that word.\" Curious, I wondered. The derivation was obvious, crop circle. His English was exceptional. So, I try to improvise. \"You know, like vistammyne,\" I said, quite literally,'round thing'. \"Vistammyne on field crops.\" For the first time he lost his smile. \"What do you know about those? Where did you get this information?\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked, kinda scared. The waitress comes with our dishes. No one thanked her, despite her politeness. \"I'm not sure what you're asking,\" I said. \"I just made a joke, but I'm sorry if I offended you.\" \"How do you know about vistammyne? Who told you?\" \"No one told me! Crop circles have been a pop culture thing in like forever!\" I reply in English, so that I could make sure none of my words would be interpreted any differently from what I'd intended. \"Are you serious?\" he asked. I take out my iPhone, google \"crop circles\" and show him the picture results. \"I I have to go!\" he replied and left me there. The alien just had a case of Runaway Bride.

{"original_text": "People often write about how they woke up in a new world. A world with its own rules, new to you and yet so painfully normal to everyone else within that existence. This isn't like that, though. When I woke up, nothing was different for me. World wide, nothing seemed different for anyone. No one realized overnight, or even within the first week. It took weeks, months even, for people to realize and come to terms with what happened. I was young when it happened. Fifteen, hardly at my prime, and there was so much adjustment. Men had been the dominant force in the world, mostly due to the fact that they were stronger and faster. A trait that really only mattered in a more medieval setting, mind you, but old habits died hard. Throughout bouts for equality and calls for reform, women never truly caught up. Thing was, though, that people had a funny way of adjusting to what was new. Our entire lives are spent getting over stuff. War, death, crime and poverty. Movies and TV shows that depict the end of days, and people stop wincing when a couple thousand are cropped off a population of billions. For some reason, people expected this to be any different. It was strange, yes, that men were suddenly the weaker species. Women didn't get any stronger, however. Men universally got weaker. Shred from their physical prowess without so much as a warning, the world took some time to adjust. It wasn't merely about stepping back and allowing women to take the lead. Everything, daily and trivial things no one had thought about before, had to be rethought. Road work, construction, menial labor, mines, war, all of which men had no real superiority in other than their natural given power. And yet, when they were less than a quarter the strength (on average) as women, women couldn't merely pick up the slack. They tried, but these were tasks designed for a strength that just wasn't naturally met. Women, though, were smart. The world changed faster than it ever did with men on top. With all the jokes about how we'd never get anything done once a month, the progress never seemed to slow down. A lot of people expected payback. For men to be treated as lesser, given the \"housewife\" treatment as most reality hosts called it. That was never the case from what I saw. Men were treated the same, if not with a little pity thrown in. Still respected, still thought of as equals by a vast majority of the female race. There were always exceptions, but that was with any rule. Men just had to get use to a world where their strength was a hindrance. I did not. I never felt the transition, though it wasn't just because of my age. In school, I would lift things for our teacher that even she thought was too heavy. At home, Mother and Father had to adjust to my being able to move things about the house at a whim. Of course Mother could do it, but not with the ease that I was able to demonstrate. As I grew older, my strength only increased. As the years passed, and I was an extremely active young man, my natural abilities were increasing exponentially. I worked out every single day I could, while attempting not to demonstrate too much of my strength in school. No one knew, not even my best friends, how strong I truly was. No one could tell just by looking at me either. Men were weaker, but their bodies were still capable of appearing toned and muscular. No, I looked no different than the rest of the men, and yet I was so very different. The history books say that the average man was two and a half times as strong as the average woman. I'd estimate I was stronger, faster, more agile than most men from that time now. My parents saw it as a freak accident, something my future family would one day find impressive. People in the past could notice obvious superiority in those with the utmost fitness. UFC fighters, special forces, all of which were strong in a time where anyone could achieve it. As far as I know, I'm the last human being in the world who is capable of this sort of strength before evolution catches back up.

And I plan to show the world just how strong I can become.", "text_perturb": "People often write about how they inflame up in a new world. A world with its own ruler , new to you and yet so painfully normal to everyone else within that existence. This is n't like that , though. When I woke up , nothing live different for me. World wide , nothing seemed different for anyone. No  realized overnight , or even within the first week. It took weeks , months even , for people to realize and come to price with what happened. I was young when it encounter. Fifteen , hardly at my premier , and there was so much adjustment. Men had been the dominant force in the public , mostly due to the fact that they were stronger and faster. A trait that truly only mattered in a more medieval setting , mind you , but old habits died hard. Throughout bouts for equivalence and calls for reform , women never truly caught up. Thing was , though , that people had a suspicious way of adjusting to what was new. Our entire lives embody spent getting over stuff. War , death , criminal offense and poverty. Movies and TV shows that depict the end of days , and people block off wincing when a couple thousand are cropped off a population of billions. For some reason , people expected this to be any dissimilar. It was strange , yes , that men were suddenly the washy species. Women did n't get any solid , however. Men universally got weaker. Shred from their physical artistry without so much as a warning , the world took some time to adjust. It was n't merely about stepping back and allowing women to carry the lead. Everything , daily and piffling things no one had thought about before , had to be rethought. Road work , construction , menial labor , mines , state of war , all of which men had no real superiority in other than their natural given power. And withal , when they were less than a quarter the strength ( on average ) as women , women could n't merely pick up the slack. They tried , but these were tasks designed for a strength that just was n't course met. adult female , though , were smart. The world modify faster than it ever did with men on top. With all the jokes about how we 'd never aim anything done once a month , the progress never seemed to slow down. A lot of masses expected payback. For men to be treated as lesser , given the `` housewife '' treatment as most realism hosts called it. That personify never the case from what I saw. Men were treated the same , if not with a minuscule pity thrown in. yet respected , still thought of as equals by a vast majority of the female race. There were always exclusion , but that was with any rule. Men just had to get use to a world where their strength embody a hindrance. I execute not. I neer felt the transition , though it was n't just because of my age. In school , I would raise things for our teacher that even she thought was too heavy. At home , Mother and Father had to adjust to my being able to go things about the house at a whim. Of course Mother could do it , but not with the ease that I make up able to demonstrate. As I grew older , my strength only increase. As the years passed , and I was an extremely active young man , my natural power were increasing exponentially. I worked out every single twenty four hours I could , while attempting not to demonstrate too much of my strength in school. No one knew , not even my best friends , how strong I rightfully was. No ace could tell just by looking at me either. valet were weaker , but their bodies were still capable of appearing toned and muscular. No , I looked no different than the rest of the men , and yet I was so really different. The history good book say that the average man was two and a half times as strong as the average woman. I 'd estimate I was stronger , faster , to a greater extent agile than most men from that time now. My parents experience it as a freak accident , something my future family would one day find impressive. People in the past could notice obvious transcendency in those with the utmost fitness. UFC fighters , extra forces , all of which were strong in a time where anyone could achieve it. As far as I know , I 'm the last human being in the world who is capable of this sort of strength before evolution apprehension back up. I was stronger than my instructor when I was fifteen , and now I 'm stronger than the world at twenty five. And I plan to show the world just how strong I can get. ", "label": 1}

I didn't really think anything of it other than a cool summer storm and a nice cup of hot chocolate on my porch. My husband had come home from work early due to him having a killer headache. My mom said it was probably the sudden change in weather; she also had some conspiracy theory about it being the government. My mom is a very interesting person. \"Michelle, do you want more hot chocolate?\" Tyler asked, motioning to the almost emptied cup resting upon my pregnant belly. I was almost 35 weeks, and I wanted to die. \"No I'm good love. How's your head?\" I replied, reaching over to rub the top of his thigh.

Just before Tyler could answer, a bright light flashed up in the sky. \"What the fuck was that?

I waddled into the sliding glass door and he shut and locked it behind us. \"Shut the window ma,\" he instructed my mom. \"Why what's going on?\" My mom started to panic, I could see it in her eyes. \"Is it a nuke?!\" She was on level nine freak out. \"No. Mom, it looked like..... it looked like a ship...\" I explained, my words shaking. \"Like a boat or like a pew pew ship?\" She asked as she did finger-guns and twirled her hand above her greying head. \"The second one.

The water was no longer rough and choppy, but was calm. And still. It was like time was paused. \"This will sound crazy but Porter was talking about this.

Or should we call your Mommy ? `` I wipe the snot off of my face and stare defiantly back into her blue eyes , but she does n't flinch , even at ten years old her eyes hold more power than any teacher. I know now that this is my only chance. A growl escapes my mouth , surprising yet me , and I shoot up from the ground. My hands meet her shoulders with a satisfying thud and she pinwheels her arms , trying to forestall the inevitable. When her butt hits the dirt I start to scat , the expanse of the playground stretching out before me as I flee. She might exist crying now , but I know that I will never cry again. ", "label": 1}

The man before her was very well composed and obviously experienced. He did not seem to be impressed with meeting the president for the first time. \" So what is this about? My calender only mentions your name and that you are a scientist of some unspecified sort. \" she said. \" Well, that is true, although I would put more on my business card, if I had one. I am the director of a research institution that was founded in late 2002 to examine an object of alien origin. \" he said. Hillary knew that many scientists mused about the possibility of aliens, but she had never been interested in that discussion. She knew she should probably be excited about the fact that alien life was apparently confirmed, but she had gotten used to the president-routine now and quickly got on with the practical details. \" Okay. Interesting. How expensive is it and what results have you come up with? \" she asked bluntly. \" It is very expensive. Currently we are using about 100 billion dollars annually, and it used to be higher. \" he said. He looked down for a short moment and then continued. \" And as for the results, we are only working on containment, and it is successfully being contained. .\" That was a large number. She should have noticed such an amount of money in the budgets. \" I am pretty familiar with the government finances. How do you manage to get that amount of money? I'm pretty sure I haven't seen'Alien research' on any of the budget proposals. \" she said with a smile. \" We get it through the military spending of the State Department. \" he said. Well the State Department spending did go up 350 billion between 2002 and 2010 but.... \" But how did you get it while the war in Iraq was going on? \" she inquired. \" The war wasn't as expensive as reported. So we just got the extra overhead. \" he replied. Hillery hoped this wasn't the only reason they had gone to Iraq. \" Okay. You said you were working on containment only? What kind of object is this? \" \" Yes, \" he said \" The object is a perfect cube about 1 meter across. We discovered it in the middle of a meteor crater surrounded by a 5 meter thick spherical shield. The inner part of the shield was made of gold and the outer part was made of a very heat resistant and durable alloy. \" Hillary didn't care much for the technical aspects, but it seemed well rehearsed, so she didn't interrupt. \" But although the shield was very resistant against blunt force impact, it was easy enough to cut open. So in 2004, we did. We accounted for everything, and prepared for the worst. Even if the cube had been made out of antimatter, the bunker would have contained the explosion. At first, after we opened the sphere, it was rather anticlimactic. Just a black cube, covered in a slimy substance. After a few minutes our initial analysis showed that the substance contained an acid, perfect for dissolving the explosion-proof container we had made. We quickly encapsulated it in a plastic container, that the acid should have been inert to, but after a few minutes the substance changed properties and started dissolving the plastic. \" he explained. Mr. Smith shrugged his shoulders and continued. \" We ended up placing it inside the original gold container again. \" That did sound anticlimactic. \" So I guess that accounts for the expenses up to 2004. What did you do afterwards? \" Hillary asked. \" Well, after we had closed up the gold shell, we detected an extremely small vibration from inside. It turns out, that the substance contained micro machinery which was drilling through the gold. This seemed strange since it could have done that before we brought it in. However, it became clear that this object was harvesting energy from the environment and using this to break down the gold. We discovered it because it drilled far less in the gold after we turned off the lights when replacing the shield. \" Mr Smith explained. \" Soon after it completely stopped drilling. We hoped that it meant that it had run out of energy, which could perhaps allow us to do more experiments on it. But after a few months of being in the same container, it suddenly started making its microscopic holes in the gold like it was drilling through butter. We just barely avoided a containment breach, and afterwards we found out, that it had probably harvested energy from combination of two things. A small thermal gradient, and vibration energy from a motor running nearby. \" \" A thermal gradient? \" Hillary asked with one eyebrow raised. Now she had let him talk uninterrupted for long enough. Scientists often seemed to have a habit of sliding into an overly technical jargon when they had been talking for too long. \" Sorry, it's when there are two different temperatures on each side of an object. It can be used to generate energy, but it's usually in so tiny amounts that - \" \" Okay ,\" Hillary interrupted before he could get going again. \" So it seems like it wants to escape, and you are trying to contain it, although it's proving to be difficult. \" \" Yes, but the fact that it suddenly started storing its energy instead of constantly drilling, implies that it understands, that it is being contained and it is getting smarter about escaping. This caused us to ramp up the security. There now are quite a lot of layers of different protection mechanisms in place. \" Mr. Smith clarified. Hillary could see the difficulties, but it did not seem to make sense. Why was it trying to escape? \" Have you tried communicating with it? \" She asked. \" Well, we have tried. We drill small holes in the gold shield to interact with the object and send in signals. Mostly low power, low frequency communication, as we don't want to give it energy. So far the only response we have gotten is dissolving equipment. \" he said while shrugging his shoulders again. \" We don't know what it's for or why it's here on earth. We do have some ideas, and they seem to universally conclude that keeping the object isolated from its surroundings is the best course of action. \" \" Can you elaborate on the ideas? How can you possibly conclude anything from an object that doesn't communicate? \" Hillary asked sceptically. \" Well, we know it was sent to earth in a shell that isolated the object. So someone, somewhere thought that sending it without a prison was a bad idea. The question is, why not just throw it into the sun, if they didn't want it to be free? Were they afraid that it would harvest all the energy instead of breaking? But then why not send it out of the galaxy? \" Mr. Smith mused. \" Maybe it is intelligent and destructive. The civilization that banished it might be so peaceful, that they could not get themselves to sentence it to death as they should have. \" \" It could also be a friendly gift, wanting to help create peace on earth and the only reason it doesn't just explain this to us is because it doesn't have enough energy to maintain coherent thoughts. The shield might just have been a wrapping to protect it from the dangers of interstellar travel. But who is going to give the order to release it and see if it is indeed merciful? \" \" Maybe it's like a timed bomb; when monkeys get smart enough to open it, it will kill them all. Whoever sent it could be afraid of competition between intelligent species. And they just hadn't expected anyone to be as cautious as us. There is just no way to really know \" Hillary agreed. The choice was flipping a coin with all of humanity at risk. Heads; it is peace on earth, tails; it is destruction of mankind. Earth is well enough off not to flip that coin. \" Thank you for the briefing, please continue your work. \" she said.

It turns out , that the substance contained micro machinery which was practice through the gold. This seemed strange since it could birth done that before we brought it in. However , it became clear that this physical object was harvesting energy from the environment and using this to break down the gold. We discovered it because it drilled far less in the gold after we turned off the luminance when replacing the shield. `` Mr joseph smith explained. `` Soon after it whole stopped drilling. We hoped that it meant that it had run out of energy , which could mayhap allow us to do more experiments on it. But after a few month of being in the same container , it suddenly started making its microscopic holes in the gold like it was drilling through butter. We just barely avoided a containment breach , and afterwards we found out , that it had probably reap energy from combination of two things. A small thermal slope , and vibration energy from a motor running nearby. `` `` A thermal gradient ? `` Hillary need with one eyebrow raised. Now she had let him talk uninterrupted for long decent. Scientists often seemed to have a habit of sliding into an overly proficient jargon when they had been talking for too long. `` Sorry , it 's when there are two different temperatures on each incline of an object. It can be used to generate energy , but it 's usually in hence tiny amounts that - `` `` Okay , '' Hillary interrupted before he could get going again. `` So it seems like it wants to escape , and you are trying to contain it , although it 's proving to cost difficult. `` `` Yes , but the fact that it all of a sudden started storing its energy instead of constantly drilling , implies that it understands , that it is being contained and it is getting smarter about escaping. This caused us to ramp up the protection. There now are quite a lot of layers of different protection chemical mechanism in place. `` mister. joseph smith clarified. Hillary could see the difficulties , but it coiffe not seem to make sense. Why was it trying to escape ? `` Have you tried communicating with it ? `` She ask. `` Well , we have stress. We drill small holes in the gold shield to interact with the object and send in signaling. Mostly low power , low relative frequency communication , as we do n't want to give it energy. So far the lonesome response we have gotten is dissolving equipment. `` he said while shrugging his shoulders once more. `` We do n't know what it 's for or why it 's here on earthly concern. We do have some ideas , and they seem to universally conclude that keeping the object isolated from its surroundings is the well course of action. `` `` Can you elaborate on the ideas ? How can you possibly conclude anything from an object that exercise n't communicate ? `` Hillary asked sceptically. `` Well , we know it was institutionalize to earth in a shell that isolated the object. So someone , somewhere thought that sending it without a prison personify a bad idea. The question represent , why not just throw it into the sun , if they did n't want it to be free ? Were they afraid that it would harvest all the energy instead of breaking ? But then why not send it out of the galaxy ? `` Mr. metalworker mused. `` Maybe it be intelligent and destructive. The civilization that banished it might be thusly peaceful , that they could not get themselves to sentence it to death as they should have. `` `` It could also be a friendly gift , wanting to help produce peace on earth and the only reason it does n't just explain this to us is because it does n't have enough energy to maintain coherent thoughts. The shield might just take in been a wrapping to protect it from the dangers of interstellar travel. But who is going to give the order to release it and see if it is indeed merciful ? `` `` Maybe it 's like a timed bomb ; when rascal get smart enough to open it , it will kill them all. Whoever sent it could be afraid of rivalry between intelligent species. And they just had n't expected anyone to cost as cautious as us. There is just no way to really know `` Hillary check. The choice was flipping a coin with all of humanity at danger. headspring ; it is peace on earth , tails ; it is destruction of mankind. Earth make up well enough off not to flip that coin. `` Thank you for the briefing , delight continue your work. `` she enunciate. mister. ian smith bowed politely and left the room. ", "label": 1}
{"original_text": "The old knight stood before the garden, where a crescent shaped pond would force those taking a stroll to deviate around either side, tempting them down any of the other paths between the hedges, down less-observed divisions of the compass. The hedges were overgrown, and the paths were barely visible now. Still, it was clear how magnificent the maze had been, once upon a time. The old knight's face seemed remorseful, his eyes distant, as if remembering those times. In the pond two koi fish danced around each other. One of them was gold, and the other black. The water would flicker with their colours as the sun glinted off their scales, and every time it did so a little rumble would send the water on the surface trembling, and sparks would fly out from the middle of the two fish. From down the path to the knight's left a rabbit emerged from underneath the hedgerow. Cautiously, sniffing the air, it determined that the maze was deserted and came out further. It was very fluffy and grey. The old knight stayed still, and the rabbit did not notice him. The rabbit foraged silently, its head buried in the grass. The way to the old knight's position was a singular path, paralleled on both sides by rose bushes. The roses grew in all different colours, on the same bush, from indigo to yellow and all the spectrum in between. Upon closer inspection, one would find that the petals were made of glass. It was said that in the middle of the maze was a fountain, or a tree. No one could decide which, as it was arguably both. The water spread upwards from the base, twisting and bubbling, until it rained down again in drips like a heavy rain, or the branches of a willow tree. No one knew what drinking from the fountain would do, not even the knight. No one had found the fountaintree for a long time. And eventually, people had stopped trying to find it. They were more likely to find the bodies of previous attempters, skeletons petrified in their final crawl, perhaps a finger stretched out, trying to point the way. Their skeletons rusted in the dew. And now the garden was overgrown, and it's secrets were unknown to all but the knight, and soon to be hidden forever. A hawk cast a shadow across the shoulders of the old knight, before diving to snatch the rabbit. The rabbit, all of a sudden surprised by the bird's dive, exploded into the white seeds of a dandelion, which were then scattered into the wind by the hawk's talons. The old knight stayed motionless, hands upon the pommel of his greatsword, his chin resting upon them. The hawk rose from its swoop, confused, and distracted, and so did not see the spiderweb stretched between the hedges. It's beak pierced the very middle, and the threads closed around her like a tattered cloak. She thrashed weakly as dozens of spiders revealed themselves amongst the leaves, shaking their spears and cheering. Music could be heard, simple tones that echoed over the maze, drifting closer and receding. The knight waited, and the music revealed itself as a dragonfly flew around one corner. It flew so fast, and turned at right angles, and each time it did so a tone rang out. A long time ago, a musical troop had tried to navigate the maze by mapping the tones to certain corners, as they had discovered a pattern. Nevertheless, they failed. The maze had other tricks, almost as many as it had stories. There were butterflies that set your clothes on fire if they landed on you. There were some passages that never ended. There were no exits besides that at which the old knight stood. The old knight would not enter the maze. Instead he stood, and watched, his stone face aged from the sun, wind, and moss.

I never really wanted to have kids, and never had had a huge sex drive, even in my teenage years. I never really talked about it, as many people still protested regularly over the legality of it. It wasn't exactly something simple to comprehend, especially for older people who had lived in a world filled with death. But for me it had become a fact of life, and I had never looked back. Would I rather have balls and a dick, or a young body forever. Well, I guess for me it was an obvious choice. Most of my none immortal friends either went away, rejected me, or moved on with their lives and had kids. The only ones left I felt I could relate to where those like me.

How the hell am I supposed to submit our budget report without her stamp of approval? Its just annoying as hell. Sinus infection my ass. I don't buy it.\" Joey grabbed Mike's beer \"Just like you won't ever buy the fucking tab you ass!\" We all laughed and took a drink as Mike tried to get his drink back. \"You know, have any of you ever gotten sick?\" I asked. Everyone looked around. \"Well I think I did a couple of times. But that was before the cure.\" Emily scratched her head. \"Yeah, I've only ever been tired, but not really ever sick.\" \"Why are you asking Chris? Did the doc have some bad news?\" I sipped from my drink. \"No, no its just that they keep giving me immunizations every year. If they are they are that effective, why not give them to everyone?\" Everyone sat in thought for a moment. \"Maybe they don't work with people who still have their reproductive organs?\" Joey stated, but I shook my head. \"See, I don't feel like that makes any sense. What could be in those immunizations that only people without those organs could take?\" The TV blared in the background talking about the top plays of the week. \"Did they ever tell you what they did with the organs?\" Suddenly the comfortable atmosphere slipped away, and Emily nervously drank from her bottle. \"What if..... what if they were using them..... ya know, somehow in the immunizations.\" We all stared at Joey as he spoke. \"I mean, I don't know about you guys but I wanted to know what was going to happen to my, well stuff.

{"original_text": "For my first thirty sum odd years of existence I never really gave any thought to the notions of God, the supernatural, or even extraterrestrial life. I was the kind of person who had to see something happen right before my eyes to believe that it actually happened. I grew up in a small Alaskan town near the coast that you've probably never heard of. The town was relatively close to a nearby oil rig and it wasn't uncommon to see drifters come and go looking for employment on the rig or one of the many fishing and crabbing vessels. The people in my town were as rough as the strenuous life they lived. Like I said, it wasn't uncommon to meet people from all over the world searching for work. I became friends with many of them and even enemies with a few. However, one drifter in particular left such an impression that he changed the very fundamentals of everything I thought I knew. Larry arrived in our town in late February that year. Earlier that year there was an explosion on the oil rig that was caused by some natural gas or something, I don't really understand how all of that stuff works, and the whole thing was pretty much destroyed but miraculously the crew had survived. I ran a little bar in the town, not much to look at, but it was the only watering hole for 50 miles in every direction. One morning as I was sweeping outside the bar, cleaning up from the night before, a face approached me that I had never seen before which like I said isn't at all uncommon in my town. \"Can I help you?\" I said, \"Sorry to bother you this early, but I'm new in town and recently unemployed.\" He said. \"I was just wondering if maybe you're hiring, I'm not too proud for any job that you could give me.\" I actually wasn't hiring at the moment and to be honest I couldn't really afford to hire anyone else, but I really felt sorry for the guy. \"I guess he can help out bussing tables and bar hopping.\" I thought. The military had also recently moved into the area doing some kind of weather research about 20 miles north, and the soldiers had begun to flock to my place. I figured maybe I could use the extra help. He was a pretty big guy as well, about 6'4 and looked strong as an ox. Every now and then a drifter would come in who thought he was a hard ass so having this guy around to settle a few scores wouldn't hurt either. \"We'll I could use someone to help out around here as a matter of fact.\" \"I can't pay you very much, but I do have an extra room above the bar that you can stay in if you'd like.\" I said. \"That'd be great.\" He said. \"When can I start?\" \"Well first I need to know your name.\" I said. \"Larry\" he said. \"Nice to meet you.\" Larry was a better worker than I had ever imagined. He was hard-working, polite, and the guy never seemed to get tired. All of the regulars loved him and we became pretty good friends too. I decided to take Larry with me to a mechanic that I knew in a town about thirty miles east. My truck's transmission light had been on for a while and I decided to have it looked at. The night before there had been some really heavy snowfall and the roads were in terrible condition. We came around a curve in the road and saw that someone had missed the curve and ran their truck off the road about 50 yards into a healthy pine tree. The truck was completely wrapped around the tree and the tree had fallen on top of the truck as well. We pulled over and ran to the truck as quickly as we could. In the passenger seat we saw and older man slumped to the side and bleeding pretty badly, but he was breathing. The way the truck was wrapped around the base of the tree and the way that the rest of it was on top of the truck there was no way to get the man out. The man was seriously injured and losing blood fast. \"Go back to the truck and close your eyes.\" Larry said in a tone I had never heard before. \"WHAT?!\" \"Do it.\" \"Now.\" He said. Dumbfounded, I reluctantly walked back to the truck, both angry and confused, and did what he said. Well, not completely. I watched. What I saw, I could not believe. Larry walked over to the truck and like you or I might lift a 20 pound dumbbell, he lifted that massive tree trunk off the top of the truck. I was in disbelief. What he did next was even more remarkable. He then proceeded to unwrap the truck from around the tree WITH HIS HANDS. When Larry walked back over to my truck holding the barely breathing man in his arms he could tell by the look on my face that I had not done as he said. After he laid the man in the backseat of my truck he got in on the passenger side of the truck and and with an inexplicable look of almost shame in his eye said, \"forget what you saw, and never speak of it.\" At that point I knew that Larry was unlike anyone else on this planet. Over the next few months feats like this continued to occur. Each time Larry seemed more and more reluctant to perform them. We never spoke of any of them and I could tell in eyes that he appreciated my silence on the subject. Larry began showing up at work In the mornings having not slept the night before. I knew this because he was never at his apartment above the bar. I watched him from my house across the street take off north every night. On foot. To the north there was absolutely nothing but an old, dilapidated road for the next 20 or so miles. Every morning as I was cleaning up from the night before I would see him come walking down that road towards the bar. I still don't know exactly what he was doing or we he was going but I suspected it had something to do with that military research going on up north. I will never forget the last night I saw Larry. A trucker hauling freshly cut timber stopped in to have a few drinks with his buddies that evening. This guy had come in a few times before and he was a real asshole every time. I had recently hired a new waitress and he decided to make it a priority that night to harass her as much as possible. Both Larry and I, were ready to throw this guy out but she told us not to worry and that she had dealt with pricks before and this guy was no different. The next time she went over there the guy decided to grab her ass and that was it. Larry was steaming and looked over at me and I have him the \"throw his ass on the street\" nod. Larry walked over there and said \"Thats enough.\" \"What are you gunna do about it?\" Said the trucker. \"Well then I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\" The guy then took his glass of beer and threw threw it in Larry's face. Larry never budged but, the guy wasn't through yet. He became angry and shoved Larry as hard as he possibly could. Larry didnt move an inch and in fact the guy bounced back off of Larry. Larry then turned around and began to walk off when suddenly a beer can came hurdling in and hit him in the back of the head. Larry walked towards the door and before he went outside gave me a wink that I will never forget. That was the last time I ever saw Larry. However, when we walked outside something unimaginable had unfolded. The truckers truck was 20 feet in the air, impaled by a string of telephone polls. I can not begin to accurately describe what we saw out there. I do know, however, who was responsible. I walked up the short flight of stairs to Larry's apartment and everything was still there but I knew he wouldn't be back. But before I left I noticed above the doorframe someone had carved, more like burned, two letters. It looked like a set of initials and it read C.K.

{"original_text": "Rough bit of writing, seems like too much work to go through it and rewrite sections so here it is! Josa was like any other, rich tattoos covering his skin. Absently he scratched at one on the back of his hand. It reminded him of lightning - it's forked spikes reaching from wrist towards knuckles. He stopped his observations however as the master passed by and instead kept sweeping. As an orphan and an outcast he had no rights and thought himself lucky that he at least had a few meals a week. It was funny really. Without the outcasts to sweep, mine and toil the citizens would have no crafts or livelihoods with which to placate the high class. And if they were not placated then they would skip the citizens and merely execute a few dozen outcasts. Surely if that continued then a time would come when there were no outcasts to toil, then who would they slaughter? Probably not the citizens, because it wasn't their fault that the Gods had vanished three centuries ago. Oh no, that was the outcasts. Of course. Josa kept his thoughts locked inside his own mind, to question a higher class was to be executed and he had no intention of following in his father's footsteps, or his mother's for that matter. At thirteen or so Josa was too young to work the heavy machinery in the textile mill, but in a few years he would be under the master's whip. Thankfully Josa's fascination with his markings kept his mind from that most of the time. Everyone in Ladenel had markings. Inky black stains that formed patterns and shapes. Josa always thought his were different but it seemed everyone thought the same about their own. Other people's markings were just squiggles to him, but his own had a pattern. The one on his hand was like lightning, his arms contained quick lines like the hurried strokes of a high class painter - seemingly making no concrete shape and yet having a pattern to them all the same. Here and there flame-like shapes licked his skin, perfect, dark circles the size of small fruits dominated other areas and something shaped like the sun sat on his forehead. A pale circle surrounded by lines shining out from it. He had spent countless nights sitting and staring at his marks by moonlight and still had no answers. Some of the high class scholars believed that they predicted the life events of the person. A few radicals thought they were events from a past life and setup whole libraries to catalog and study them hoping to work out who a person was in their previous life. Josa didn't believe either. It wasn't that he thought they were wrong just that he didn't think they were particularly right either. Perhaps the lightning meant he would be struck one day - killed even. The sun on his forehead could be the God under which he was born. The circles? He hadn't decided those yet, nor the lines and flames. Shouts shocked Josa back to the real world. A commotion was brewing outside the mill. Men's voices shouting at each other. Josa glanced around and didn't see the master so he made his way towards the sounds at the far end of the mill, near a wide sliding door. It was shut but it was also very thin. Through he he could hear the voices more clearly. It was a fight of some kind. Not that unusual, but then the faint clinking of chainmail and drawing of swords. Josa slid the doors open a slither and peeked out. What he saw terrified him. Three burly outcasts - marked by their ragged clothing and dirty skin - stood above a motionless guard. His vibrant cloak lying limp on the floor revealing his sparkling chain stained crimson. Two of the men held swords. One looked fine and ornate - the guard's most likely Josa thought - and the other was much more basic and less kept. The shouting had stopped and the three men regarded their equally numbered counterparts eagerly. The guards wore their own rich, red and blue cloaks. Square looking hats adorned their heads and golden buttons accentuated both cloak and hat. Beneath the finery however was a soldier's garb. Chain mail and leather. A large sheath and a smaller knife pouch - after all, the outcasts vastly outnumbered the guard. A flurry of activity began, slashing swords glinting golden sunlight, brilliant cloaks flapping with motion. A few cries, a scream, a thud and a clang of steel. Then the street was silent again. One man remained standing, four dead guards, two dead outcast and a lone, bloody figure standing above them all. Then the man dropped his fine sword and ran. Seconds later Josa heard the shouts and pounding feet of reinforcements drawn to the commotion but the man, the hero, was long gone. What man would dare do such a thing? Josa was part awed and part terrified. He longed to stand up to the high class himself. Not five years ago they had killed his parents by execution for no crime. They were merely outcasts and therefore deserved no life. But despite his brave desires he was too small, too weak and too scared to do what that hero had just done. The approaching guards checked the bodies for life and then began to search the area. One looked Josa's way and caught a glimpse before the boy dashed away. A moment later the doors were wrenched open by two of the guards. Josa ran. But a half starved boy had no chance outrunning well fed and trained soldiers. The mill was big, and had rows of fast moving, spinning machinery, dangerous machinery. The perfect place to hide. Josa sprinted down an aisle between machines. Surprised workers ducked away then cowed as they saw the guard approaching. Josa dashed left, rounding a huge loom and hoping it gave him the seconds he needed to dive under it's whirling mechanisms. He scrambled under spinning wheels and threading needles just as booted feet sprinted past. Josa breathed a sigh of relief and then panted heavily - the overwhelming sound above masking any noise he made. Then the world was yanked away. No, he was yanked away. Pain erupted in his shoulders are gloved hands gripped tightly. He was forced to his feet and held there. He tried to spin to see his attacker but caught only a glimpse of a guard uniform.

{"original_text": "President-Regent Langley was due to meet with Chinese President Ha Jin today at noon, in the White House Blue Room. Press and other observers from both sides of the Pacific crowded the Rose Garden and the lobby, jockeying for entry. What the President-Regent did today how he conducted himself would determine the course of the current hostilities. The two statesmen danced the usual Kabuki act of formality: handshakes, mutual bows, an invitation to have a seat, smiles for the cameras. Their discussion in the Blue Room was not ever meant to be substantive, but just look good for the PR machine. The real discussions were happening, and would continue to happen, behind closed doors, in embassies and conference rooms, and they would involve not just the two heads of state but whole retinues of career diplomats working tirelessly, around the clock, to avert nuclear war. \"It's an honor to have you here today,\" President-Regent Langley said to President Ha Jin, once the two men had settled themselves in the plush leather chairs that angled toward one another. \"It is an honor to be here,\" President Ha Jin said in fluent English hardly an accent. \"Well,\" President-Regent Langley said, \"let's see how you feel after you've had some of my wife's cooking.\" Laughter from the press corps, flashbulbs popping. President Ha Jin arched his eyebrows, playing confused. \"Interesting custom,\" he intoned. \"Should not Cynthia Hannigan be cooking tonight's meal? She is, after all, the true First Lady.\" President-Regent Langley pretended to flick some lint off the knee of he pleated trousers. He wished he could reach across the small square table separating him from President Ha Jin and throttle him unconscious. Instead he plastered a pained smile across his face and said: \"Cynthia has been through a lot these past few months, as you're well aware. She isn't making public appearances just yet.\" He patted President Ha Jin on the shoulder and satisfied himself with the fantasy that he was doing much more violence to the man. \"Besides,\" he continued, \"young John is a mama's boy through and through, but Cynthia is hardly the First Lady. She is the President Mother. And on that note he flashed a toothier, more winning smile to the contingent of reporters \"I look forward to the day, hopefully soon, that our young President can have a real First Lady living by his side at the White House.\" \"Mm,\" President Ha Jin grunted. \"Then let us dispense with these niceties. Shall we sign the treaty?\" State department officials came in through the side door, bearing a small podium and a scroll with the treaty's text written upon it in a regal faux script. The terms were already set and approved by both nations' congresses this signing, too, was a nicety of its own kind. In exchange for the Chinese withdrawing its missile silos from the irradiated ruins of Hokkaido and its armies from beleaguered Honshu, allowing the Japanese people a self-determining government; the US had agreed to surrender the Beijing Five to Chinese custody, release control of its Pacific protectorates, and link the two nations' dynasties by marriage. The two statesmen each took a fountain pen. President Ha Jin stood and stooped over the podium to sign his name in Mandarin. He stepped aside and President-Regent Langley took his place. But before Langley could sign, Ha Jin stopped him. \"I do not believe,\" President Ha Jin said, \"according to your fine nation's constitution, that the Vice President has the power to sign any bills or treaties into law.\" President-Regent Langley's false smile dropped from his face. He allowed himself to appear angered projecting strength with regards to his claim on the Presidency was paramount. \"Don't be silly, now,\" he said. \"I am the acting President. Our constitution is very clear on this. I may sign bills into law.\" \"Nonetheless, I would rather John Hannigan sign the treaty, assuming he is literate. And I would like to see him, anyway. I was quite fond of his father, you will recall and since the young boy is soon to marry my daughter, I want to make his acquaintance.\" President-Regent Langley stopped himself from grimacing. This was a power play, naked and unashamed. He could buck back, join into a pissing contest assert firmly the legitimacy of his signature on the treaty. He wanted to, if only for his personal sense of pride. But more paramount than his claim on the Oval Office was that this treaty be successful. He would allow the Chinese no grounds on which to later dispute its terms. \"Have it your way,\" he said, cordially. \"President Hannigan just recently learned to sign his name and I think he would be proud to show everyone how precocious he is.\" Langley turned and said to an aid: \"please, go fetch John.\" President Ha Jin grinned smugly, but Langley had his own way of saving face in front of the world's eyes: \"since we are involving the young President,\" he said, \"why don't you fetch Qingxiang? They'll be husband and wife soon enough they should meet, don't you agree?\" President Ha Jin's ruddy complexion went slightly paler. But with reporters excitedly snapping photos and filming, he had no justification for refusing this ostensibly friendly request. In Mandarin, he asked his own aide to go get Qingxiang. Some moments later, little John Hannigan III, 56th President of the United States and Outlaying Territories and Protectorates, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Head of State and Government, and Defender of Liberty, toddled into the room. He could hardly yet walk, but wore a dapper dark black fitted suit, a gray silk shirt with matching blue silk tie, pointed loafers and pressed trousers. He was, as the papers loved to say time and again, the spitting image of his recently late father. President-Regent Langley knelt, the joints in his knees crackling. \"John,\" he said, \"we need you to sign your name.\" \"Sign my name!\" he said. \"Sign my name!\" He hopped up and down a couple times. \"That's right, John. Can you do that for us?\" \"Uh-huh!\" John's personal aides offered to get a hassock for him to stand upon so he could reach the podium to sign, but President-Regent Langley waved them off. Instead, he held John under the armpits and hoisted him up to the proper height. The press loved it, American and Chinese alike. John chewed on his tongue, trying his darnedest to sign neatly, just like he had been taught, though the result was still a splotchy chicken scratch that scrawled across the page. Langley beamed proudly while he held the young President. President Ha Jin blanched. Only someone like Langley could turn public humiliation at the hands of the Chinese into such a PR coup. That was why he was regent, after all. Soon after the signing was completed, President-Regent Langley suggested that the two signatories should finalize the treaty with a handshake. He relished the image of President Ha Jin bending forward to shake the hand of a toddler. You wanted to do your diplomacy with a child you got it, he thought bitterly. President Ha Jin's aides returned to the Blue Room with Qingxiang Jin in tow. She was two years older than John, and tall even for her age, so that side-by-side she seemed to tower over him. Her face was pale, and almost gaunt, her long raven hair often concealing her eyes. \"Hi,\" John said to his fiancee, \"I'm President Hannigan!\" \"I am Qingxiang,\" the girl said, struggling with what pieces of English she knew. Without prompting, the young President waddled forward and wrapped his arms around the girl he would soon wed. The girl went stiff, not sure how to respond, but with all eyes upon her she decided it would be best to hug him back. The press could not resist letting forth a chorus of awws and other heartwarmed cooing. President-Regent Langley felt like vomiting. But then Langley felt something else stirring inside him, as he watched the tiny girl. She didn't know what to do she kept glancing back at her father, who would give her no guidance, not even a simple nod or a shake of the head. President-Regent Langley considered the grim life that lay ahead of this girl. Yes, John liked her now, in his youthful naivety. But he would be raised to despise her. And thenceforth she would be a virtual prisoner in this foreign country, cut off from her family and all possibility of friends. She would be excluded from all government functions and distrusted by the people of both nations. Perhaps once or twice, when the couple came of age, John would joylessly rut inside of her and thereby produce the heirs that were the chief project of this marriage. And beyond this, her life would have no meaning. \"Let's hang out,\" John said, pulling back from the hug. \"We can play blocks!\" \"Blocks...\" Qingxiang said. \"Or dinosaurs! Do you like dinosaurs too?\" Qingxiang, startled and baffled, once more cast a glance back at her father, and once more received no help. She looked back at the young President. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I also like dinosaurs.\" \"What's your favorite?\" \"Erm Triceratops, I think.\" \"I like that one too,\" John said, nodding sagely. \"But T-Rex is my favorite. I have both, though. We can play them together!\" \"Hmm, that sounds fun.\" Langley did not like this. Neither did Ha Jin. But it was happening in public, and who were they to deny the two young lovebirds a play date? That would be a public relations disaster. For the first time, neither man felt like they had a real grip on power after all.", "text_perturb": "President-Regent Langley was due to meet with chinese President Ha Jin today at noon , in the White House Blue Room.

Hasn't done that since the divorce. It's probably nothing. \"Goddamit Kyle would you stop fidgeting!\" Raul hissed \"It's making me all sorts of uncomfortable.\" \"Can't help it\" Kyle protested. A smile grew on his face until it reached his eyes. \"I can't stop thinking about what I'm gon na do with my cut.\" He let the silence linger for a moment, hoping it would allow his partners to arrive at the same euphoric realization. \"A quarter mill, each,\" adding emphasis on the last word. \"We don' got our money yet,\" Raul stated with thinly veiled irritation. Raul wouldn't have even bought Kyle with them if he could, but no one could break through firewalls as quick as Kyle. More importantly Kyle was even better at not leaving any digital fingerprints behind. When it came to doing tech quick and clean, Kyle was the best, as long as he didn't have a panic attack. But despite the odds, Kyle kept it together two-hundred and fifty grand had that effect on people. \"No need to shit on my parade Raul. Speaking of which.\" Kyle leapt to his fit with a graceless jolt as he headed off to the restroom. Rauled scowled at his back. \"Just make it quick.\" A period of silence lingered. Normally that would bother me, but Raul was a guy who you hang out with in silence and not feel the impulse to start small talk just to break the silence. It was comfortable, professional even. Which caused his breaking the silence to catch me by surprise. \"What are you gon na spend it on. You're cut I mean.\" I'm going to build the life of a man my daughter can be proud of. I shrugged, \"Probably move to nicer apartment to start with. Maybe start using my powers for good instead of evil.\" Raul smirked. He never laughed. \"Yeah, you'll start shitting rainbows and sunshine will come out you're ass.\" He studied his feet for a moment, then looked up at me. \"You were never really meant for this life,\" he stated. He wasn't being rude or condescending. Just stating a fact. I didn't fit in. I saw something more with my life. I always believe on a way out. Kyle didn't care for one, Raul didn't have a choice. He made too many bad decisions with the wrong people. He stopped believing on a way out a long time ago. Before I could respond, the bathroom door shot open, and Kyle marched out clutching his gut. \"You might not want to go in there. Smells like, well, shit.\" Kyle collapsed back into his chair, still clutching his gut. \"That did not feel good.\" Before Raul could say whatever obscene thought was on his mind, the radio on his belt yelled up at him. \"Yo, got that SUV pullin' in. I think that's our guy,\" said the cheery voice on the radio. \"Got it Ben. Stay up there and keep an eye out,\" Raul stated with obvious relief on his voice. I glanced down at my phone to see it was 12:59. Nope, 1:00 now. \"Got to hand it to this guy, hell of an entrance,\" I said with as much sarcasm I could muster. \"It'll be even better if he comes with the mill' he owes us,\" Raul reminded. The job wasn't over, and Raul didn't let any of us forget it. Ever. The black SUV pulled into the warehouse, obviously, this guy watched way to many movies. But if his money was good, I guess I could let it slide. Still, I guess I should give him some slack. He's giving me a second chance with Julie, even though he doesn't know it. It may not work out, but this man is giving me what I need to gain my daughters respect again. And maybe someday, her love. A man with wearing an jet black suit stepped out of the driver's door. with his all black attire, he would have blended in entirely with the darkness behind him if his shoes didn't shine with the little light that existed. \"You have my crate?\" he asked, monotonously. \"You got our money?\" Raul responded, completely disinterest with everything else. \"First I want to see the product, make sure it's still in the box.\" The coldness of his voice was matched only by the condescesion it carried with it. Raul and I shared an uncomfortable glance. \"You asked us to get the crate. It's still locked and sealed, you can see that easy enough,\" Raul explained, as though one professional to another. \"I don't give a damn what's in it, but I did a job, and now I get paid.\" Even though there was only thirty feet between the client and Raul, it seemed to grow farther than that. This has to go down right, it has to. A few moments existed before the client responded. \"Either you open the chest, and show me whats inside, or I walk away, and you get to keep your bounty.\" A thin smile formed on his face, \"But how long do you think it will take for the cops to track down government property?\" Glancing over at Raul, I immediately saw Raul calculating whether it was worth dumping someplace if we weren't paid. But we had to get paid. I had to get paid. \"Raul,\" I breathed. He snapped his head towards me. I showed weakness in a negotiation, and left us with little choice. He walked over to the wall and pick up a crowbar. I quickly rushed to get the lock open and was able to break through it with a pair of bolt cutters. Raul and Kyle walked over with the crowbars and started pulling up on the metal crate. I watched them eagerly, praying that what we found in the metal box was what our client was looking for. As the lid slowly started to lift, I started getting nauseous. Just nervousness, the next few seconds decided my future. \"It's about to give\" Kyle cheered. Over Kyle's shoulder, I saw a report of our heist, and it showed what we stole: experimental thorium. Despite the muted volume, I could see the reporters lips form a word, no, a sentence. Lethal. We were about to open a crate of radioactive material. WE'RE TRYING TO OPEN IT! \"Wait!\" I tried to warn, but my yell was drowned by the loud metallic pop of the lid breaking its seal. It was then that I felt it. Heat, worming through my flesh, holding every nerve entralled, unable to act on its own. I tried to warn my partners again, but instead of words, vomit came up. It came up again, and again, and again. It quickly changed from vomit to blood. Then to bits of flesh came up with the blood. I collapsed. Looking over at Raul and Kyle, I saw their faces blistered and burned. They got the full brunt of it, they got quick deaths. I envied them for a moment. \"Excellent,\" the client said with his typical monotonous voice. He was wearing a Hazmat suit now. When did he get that on? Why wasn't I paying attention to him? \"It's exactly what I wanted.\" I was breathing heavily, desperately trying to fill what was left of my lungs with air. Every attempt to yell or scream shot burning pain through my throat. \"The client looked over his shoulder. More men were walking towards him from the SUV. \"Wasn't there a fourth man, just outside about a block?\" Under the visor, I could make out the cruel grin of one of the men who had just appeared. \"He's taking a nap, I don't think he's gon na wake up though,\" the man with the cruel grin began to smile, as though impressed with his own wit. \"Good, then seal this up and let's get out of here.\" In those final moments, I watched as the men who killed Ben, Kyle, and Raul, reseal the crate. Despair gripped me as my now blind eyes tried to cry. My wife was right: I would die on the streets. But Raul was right too. It wasn't where I belonged.", "text_perturb": "`` I get along n't like it , this things to hot to keep here '' Kyle jittered. `` It 's been almost an hour , we got ta rifle an `` Calm down , '' assured Raul , starring at the TV. `` He 's got till 1 to show.

Everything had rifle according to plan. considerably actually. We were all in and out like ghost : no witnesses , no complicatedness , and no trace. It comprise a perfect heist.

Before he had opened the box he had been sure it was his latest order from amazon for novels and action figures, but found it instead. A missent package. He thought. And clearly broken: The clock was telling the wrong time: 1459 hours. No M or AM. Just the minutes, seconds and milliseconds in white digits. When he put the clock away he noticed the type-writer written paper under it. He took it out of the box and read it. \"When this clock hits zero, you will die.\" There was nothing else but that. He stared at the note, feeling blank for a moment. This always happened: No matter how many chain mails he received or comments he saw online saying'If you don't resend thisread this your familyyou will die', he always felt that small fear and dread. There was always that irrational second where he believed it, considered it, but then he would be free of that all. That just never happened. Yes, even if you think ' that will never happen'it's not the sign that it will. Real life had no time for such nonsense. He looked at clock and again, seeing the time. 1458 hours. That was a couple of days. 2 months. In two months he would die, apparently. \"Guess I've better make up for the lost time. \" He said. He had a strange indescribable feeling of deja vu. It sort of felt like the plot to Richard Matheson's'Button, Button. Minus the choice. He had to hand it to them, as far as hoaxes went this one was well thought out. The clock did not look cheap at all. It was such a simple but effective way to screw with somebody, and he knew he'd be playing with the idea in his head even after he threw away and ignored the stuff. Strangely, he never got around to doing it. Life got in his way, or rather the glorious world of the internet did. He had guns to shoot, stuff to watch, parties to attend and regret getting too drunk at. Business as usual. One month down the line he remembered the clock again and looked at the timer. It was definitely broken. It seemed to have gone down more than before. It claimed he had 321 hours remaining to live. \"Huh.\" He said as he took an entire sip of the vodka he had by his computer. He watched as the digital display suddenly paused, and then the number knocked itself down. Now 320. \"What's up with that?\" It was unsettling. On a whim, he took another shot, and just like well - clockwork - the timer decreased again. This time by a few minutes. It took him another week to figure out that the time decreased or increased according to his habits. They were miniscule changes mostly though, and he tried to ignore it all, put the clock in a corner somewhere. He still couldn't get himself to get rid of it though. Frustrated at the claim that he had only 72 hours to live, he tried to open it. And found it was impossible to: Literally. The thing had no screws to be unscrewed, and he knew that something was very wrong when in frustration, he tossed the clock on the floor and nothing happened. It made a loud crack as it went across, but when he picked it up it was completely unscarred. \"What the hell.\" He started jogging. He stopped smoking and drinking and tried to spend his time outside. There was a mixture of dread and relief as his time went up by 200 hours, but then it refused to budge after that. He gave up and spent his days wasted in his apartment, watching the cursed clock and thinking he'd gone mad somehow without noticing. As of May 31st, he was going to apparently die in 23 hours. He couldn't sleep or eat. Every time he convinced himself it was all a joke he took a hammer, a rock or anything to smash the clock and with his failure realized that something abnormal was going on here. He told his friend Trevor as much. \"You seriously expect me to believe this?\" Said Trevor, his friend. He was studying the clock. He wanted to strangle him, \"Do I look like I'm joking? I received this thing back in January. End January, like two months ago. And it's unbreakable. Try it.\" \"Unbreakable, huh.\" Trevor said, walking over to the window and tossing it out. \"What the hell man!\" He rushed to stop him, but was only in time to hear it smack the pavement. His apartment was on the third floor. \"Dude, you clearly need to get out more. \" Trevor said as he kicked an empty pizza box on the floor. \"Plus you stink. This whole room stinks. Get a shower and clean this place up before you make this whole building block a biohazard for godssake. Then, we're going out for some good old socialization.\" \"Dude \"20 minutes.\" Trevor said before taking a seat. So he took a shower. By the time he was done he felt like his head had broken water. It was all so silly, wasn't it? \"Wait. Tomorrow is April 1.\" He realized. The bastards. They had gotten him for sure. Hook line sinker and bait. This would be a great story to write about later. A definite legend to explain over drinks too. It had seriously messed him up. He laughed out loud. \"You ready?\" Trevor said when he was finally done with some rudimentary cleaning of the flat. It had been a pig sty at this point. He needed to sort that out. Maybe even get his life in order. If there was a silver lining to this whole nonsense, was that he could do a better job of taking care of himself. \"Let's go.\" He said. So they went out and had a great time. But the simple great time turned into a party, and he found himself out all night up until midnight. Business as usual. Trevor drove him back and supported him as he stumbled everywhere towards the apartment. He didn't even remember leaving the bar. \"You're the best man! The best!\" He slurred. \"I was seriously in the dumps man. That stupid clock screwed with me in more ways than one.\" Trevor didn't answer him. Was distracted by something. He was looking up at something in silence. \" Hey... \" That was when he smelt the smoke. He looked up and saw that the whole apartment block was on fire. Black smoke roiled out of the windows. There were screams, sirens. He'd been too drunk to even notice. \"I'm..... I'm gon na be...\" He stumbled away and got sick in a nearby gutter. He felt a little bit better.

{"original_text": "Both X.25 and Frame Relay provide connection-oriented operations. But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDsthe virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLCLAPDLAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS.

{"original_text": "First, let me clarify by saying I don't support actual, intentional bashing of any kind, however: We see jokes about it (especially on Reddit) all the time: political correctness is reaching a ludicrous level in our everyday society. It is getting to the point where you can't even make jokes or off-hand remarks without being considered rude, distasteful, ignorant, what ever. I think this is not only not really helpful to a person or group of persons who are facing adversity, it is detrimental. It causes issues that could be making actual progress to falter and nit-pick all of the tiniest little problems they can find rather than strive for real change. It is inadvertently focussing on the negativity in society rather than trying to find a positive solution. It is my opinion that the only way to get past adversity in life is to toughen up and become immune to it and push your way through it. Real change comes about because of real actions. This post was inspired by the earlier discussion on the use of the word \"cisgendered\" and wether it is \"normal\" or wether we should then be differentiating the difference between diabetics and nondiabetics and so forth. I don't think this is a helpful debate overall. sure, if you are asking what gender someone is, it is okay, even good, to distinguish, but all I keep seeing around here, and in real life, and at an increasing rate, is how we all need to check our privilege and be more and more sympathetic; how white people can't relate to minority problems, men can't relate to women's suffrage, cisgendered people can't really understand what transgendered people go through... it just keeps getting more and more specific, and in my opinion, its just focussing everyone's attention on what is wrong with the world, and doesn't actually help us make it better. Adversity is everywhere, it hits everyone. I may be a man, but maybe my dad sexually abused me and locked me in the basement my whole childhood. That girl may be white, but maybe she was raised in a seedy part of town with a drug addicted prostitute mother. Maybe that guy is a straight white male from a nice neighborhood, but he was somehow infected with HIV and now he has AIDS. My point is, none of those people are going to get through their hardships by focussing on those things they can't change, doing so would only hinder their own growth. I can't help but think the same thing when I hear about someone getting upset about someone else using language they find to be offensive. Again, I'm not saying bullying is okay, but the line between what is considered okay to joke about, and what is borderline a hate crime seems to be getting thinner and thinner. In my eyes, trying to further political correctness is only babying everyone and hindering actual growth. TL;DR There is no relative degree of suffering, everyone has a hard life, and trying to force everyone to walk on eggshells all the time doesn't help anyone make their life better.

License plates are more difficult to forge. Plus the license plate would be linked to the make, model and color of the vehicle making forgeries simple to detect. There is limited space on windows and stickers interfere with seeing out of your window. They are also difficult to remove. You could end needing many stickers that conflict in placement.

I was pretty annoyed to discover that [aspects of the film's plot were warped for the purpose of making it more dramatic] . I do not think any good comes of this, and to be honest it makes me quite mad. For example, in the film, the main character Alan Turing is portrayed by the actor as obviously autistic to some extent, but according to a quote on Wikipedia (not sure exactly who said it) \"the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film.... bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing.\" This, I think, is insulting to Turing's memory, to customise his personality as to make the film more interesting or to make the audience more sympathetic towards his character. Sometimes it's less minor than character modification. I distinctly remember watching 13 Days (2000) in a high school history class to supplement our Cold War study. This film ramped up the'Soviets are evil and JFK is a god' theme to the point of including an entirely fictional battle scene, but went out of its way to present itself as a historically accurate film, including real Cold War footage throughout.

It's also been criticised for attributing a major role in the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis to Kenneth O'Donnell - somebody who was actually there argues that \"For God's sakes, Kenny O'Donnell didn't have any role whatsoever.... that's absurd.\" I think overblowing or underplaying real people's roles in history is just insulting, and cannot be justified. Thus, I am suggesting that films which are'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred. I will pre-argue some anticipated arguments in advance: \"They're claiming to be based on a true story, not perfectly historically accurate.\" Yes, but these films spread misinformation all the same.

{"original_text": "In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want to is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to things that are unacceptable to do to a person without his or her permission. Telling someone that they can't get a medical procedure done (or, likewise, telling that they HAVE to get a medical procedure done) is just as awful as is dictating how they were their hair or how they dress. In that same vein, what makes it okay in our society for your significant other to dictate who you sleep with? Sex in our society is a recreational activity enjoyed by most adults in at least some capacity. People dictating what their SOs do for fun in their free time seems rather controlling. Adults should feel free to do what their bodies what they wish as long as they aren't physically forcing another person to do something. Forcing another person to only have sex with you seems to me like an awfully controlling behavior and takes away the body autonomy that they should have. I can understand if a couple decides between the two of them that would like to sleep exclusively with each other. It's just surprising to me at times that it is the norm to be mad enough at your SO to break up with them if they have sex with someone outside of the relationship. I understand that people cheat all the time, but open relationships just seem to be the exception rather than the norm. If you want a monogamous relationship and your SO sleeps with someone else, then you shouldn't be mad at your SO. You should simply realize that you guys want different things out of a relationship and part ways. Getting angry would be controlling your SO and taking away his or her own control over his or her own body. And just for clarification: I am not saying that everyone should go out and cheat on their SOs. I am more stating that it should be normal and acceptable for people to have sex with people outside of a two person relationship for no other reason than that it is oddly controlling to insist that your SO sleep with no one besides you.

In fact , forcing one to have sex when they do n't want to is just the bakshish of the iceberg when it comes to things that are unacceptable to do to a person without his or her permission. Telling someone that they ca n't get a aesculapian procedure done ( or , likewise , telling that they HAVE to get a aesculapian procedure done ) is just as awful as is dictating how they were their hair or how they dress. In that same vein , what makes it okay in our society for your significant other to dictate who you sleep with ? Sex in our society be a recreational activity enjoyed by most adults in at least some capacity. People dictating what their SOs do for fun in their free time seems instead controlling. Adults should feel free to do what their bodies what they wish every bit long as they are n't physically forcing another person to do something.

{"original_text": "Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich. However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons: First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were \"more equal than the others.\" Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people's inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. Second of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it. If for example say USA will start implementing even minor socialists norms, then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers of USA and take away their jobs. Which is indeed the case with things like outsourcing and not so quickly growing USA economy. The solution for USA would then be to close itself up and live in a world where there are no imports or exports, this would protect its citizens from fierce external competition, but leave USA lacking behind in progress of all kinds. Examples for this are Venezuela or Columbia. All in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc. However this are minor elements, which I think, should otherwise be implemented in fierce Capitalist society, where in order to succeed you cannot rely on gov. support, but 95 on yourself.

{"original_text": "The title mentions specifically a tattoo on the forearm, but the underlying premise of my argument is based on a tattoo which would not be visible in formal clothing (such as slacks and a button down) but would be visible in casual wear (shorts and T-shirt). Such a tattoo would not affect chances of college acceptance for three reasons; the ubiquity of tattoos amongst college-aged individuals, the relative unimportance of personal image in the college acceptance process, and the low chance of anyone even seeing the tattoo. According to a Pew Research Centre report, nearly 38 of college-aged individuals have a tattoo. While that is not a majority by quite a margin, it is a significant amount. Additionally, the popularity and accessibility of tattoos are steadily increasing year by year leading to a greater acceptance amongst a younger crowd. The point here is that because of their widespread nature, tattoos are no longer seen as a sign of rebellion simply because they are so commonplace. Furthermore, most colleges prefer to accept or deny students based on their applications alone, rather than on interviews. Unlike a job interview, in which personal image can make or break someone's chances of getting employment, colleges tend to focus more on scholastic and athletic merit, test scores, and lifetime achievements first. Personal image is last on the docket for a school good enough to conduct personal interviews, if even considered at all.

This is not consistent with reality and the first two points I make concerning college can be applied to employment as well; tattoos are slowly gaining acceptance in the workforce as the 38 of college students with tattoos graduate and seek employment, and that employers will seek to hire the most qualified candidate with less emphasis placed on personal image.

{"original_text": "I am strictly a PC gamer. I own an XBox controller for my PC and am very interested in the upcoming Steam controller. But I'm hesitant to make the purchase, as I barely use my XBox controller. I have tried several times to get used to playing with a controller - even reinstalling old games and starting with the controller to familiarize myself - and I always go back to'mouse and keyboard'. Below are the reasons I think'mouse and keyboard' is the best way to play PC games (really: any game, but KM is really only an option on the PC). The mouse is infinitely more precise than a controller. I can't even imagine playing FPS games with a controller (mostly, I've been playing 3rd-person action games a la Arkham and Tomb Raider). I know many FPS games use an aim assist system to compensate for the imprecision of a controller. I would rather have a more precise input system than an'assist' to compensate for the imprecision of my input device. Because we use them all the time, a keyboard is intuitive. Most of us use computer keyboards and mice on a daily basis in our work. Every QWERTY keyboard has the same layout. When a game tells me'press X', I know exactly where X is. Even people who are very familiar with controller layouts haven't spent nearly as much time with that controller as they have with a keyboard and mouse. Keyboard and mouse work for all games. As I mentioned, I prefer the precision of KM for FPS games. But I'm also a big-time RTS and strategy gamer (Total War are my favorite games) and there's no way I could imagine playing strategy games with a controller. KM works for everything. I even preferred Dark Souls with a KM - a game that many will say is only playable with a controller. I am perfectly comfortable in my computer chair. One of the big advantages I often hear about controllers is the ability to play from the couch. I prefer to be close to my display (I play on a 32in TV and sit about 3 feet back). My keyboard and mouse sit on a laptop desk and my computer chair is very comfortable. I feel more engaged in my games at the distance I sit vs. sitting on the couch. Why I want my view changed: I think the Steam controller looks really cool, but I'm not sure I'd use it. I don't want to make a purchase I won't use. Am I missing out on good experiences that only a controller can offer? I've got a device I barely use. I would like to use it more, if there are games in which using it would give me a better experience. Edit: many good suggestions in this thread so far. I'm going to spend a few minutes playing some of the types of games mentioned (stealth, action, driving, etc.) and see if the controller enhances the experience. Edit 2: Hey everyone. Thanks so much for the discussion. Lots of good points made, but I think the best was made by ustoopydumbut, who suggested that using a controller adds an additional level of challenge. Props, also, to all the users who pointed out the genres of games (racing, fighting, flight sims) that I don't play, but benefit from a controller. I am going to make it point to use my controller as often as I can going forward, and am still considering a Steam controller purchase. Thanks, everyone, this was exactly the conversation I wanted to have. Please feel free to keep posting, if you have something new to add. I will keep reading, commenting, and awarding deltas.

{"original_text": "Immediately after graduating college I was searching for my first \"real\" job, and thought that 12.50hr at that time (1999) was a lot of money. So I went to work for a rent-to-own company, and 5 years of pain and suffering began. There were a combination of factors that I believe make this accurate. First, the hours were long (55 per week), and where the 12.50hr got severely diluted. They would tell you the starting salary was, say 27k year, and then once you divided that out by 55 hours per week as opposed to a normal 40 hour week, you got a much lower hourly figure.

I moved furniture all day, every day for 55 hours per week. We carried couches, big screen TV's, washer, dryers, etc - all into places they normally have no business going - basements, attics, 3rd floor apartments up rickety staircases, very dangerous. Third, and probably the worst part, was the interaction with customers. Our clientele were the down and out, the disadvantaged, criminals, strippers, drug dealers, etc. People with no credit, who couldn't buy their desired goods on credit. We rented them shit they couldn't afford, for the desired markup of 5x what we paid for the items. They had to verify a form of income and provide 4 references, and boom - instant shiny new stuff for their houses they couldn't afford.

Oh there were some perks, like driving around on our biggest collection day (Saturday) and going from strip club to strip club collecting money from our customers that were dancers.

{"original_text": "Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for \"sleeping around,\" and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour. I want to make this point clear - I am NOT debating whether or not it is goodbad when a woman engages in behavior that is typically defined under the scope of \"slut.\" That is another argument altogether. I am only asserting that the difference in reaction the majority of people have when they hear about the sexual exploits of either gender is, in general, justified. The reason for this, of course, is biological. It is generally imperative for males to propagate their DNA throughout many different potential mates as possible, to ensure the survival of his line. Historically, however, females had to be more restrictive with who they engage in intercourse with, because they were then strapped with the burden of taking care ofraising a child as a product of the encounter. The brains, hormone profiles, and physiology are disparate between the genders to reflect, in part, these differences in motivation. Given these differences, the crux of my argument boils down to this: it is simply more difficult for a heterosexual man to attain sex, than a woman, ceterus paribus. Once again, to be very clear, I'm not making any moral claims about being a slut; I'm simply stating the difference in difficulty in accomplishing the same task, and the justification of the subsequent reaction. To illustrate this point, I would like to I highlight the scenario of Bob. Bob built a business from the ground up; through sheer hard work and determination, he came from nothing, and now runs a company of hundreds of employees, making millions in revenue. Now, here is Patrick. Patrick also has a company of hundreds of employees, making million dollars in revenue, through his hard work and determination. The difference between Bob and Patrick is this - Bob had absolutely zero dollars in his bank account when he started his business, while Patrick inherited over 5 billion from his father's trust fund. So, even though both have technically accomplished the same thing, it would be fair to say that Bob deserves higher praise. The difference being, of course, while the task itself was the same, the difficulty level of either party to achieveaccomplish this task is significantly different. In the same way, we can assert that (all things being equal) it is much more difficult for a man to sleep with many women, than the reverse. Now, anticipating potential rebuttals, I would like to highlight other scenarios using the same logic above: I believe that heterosexual men (and homosexual women) deserve more praise than homosexual men for the same acts. To what degree, I'm honestly not sure, as I'm not an expert in biologysociology of this kind, but using the biological argument for the difficulty of the task, I would say that homosexual men hooking up is generally easier than the other scenarios.

{"original_text": "Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women in positions of power - increase the number of women that are firefighters or police I can't help feeling that it is a rather useless cause. I have no problem at all with there being less women than men in any place. What I would (and do) have a problem with is women having it more difficult than men to enter certain professions. That is the real problem we should, as a society, try to solve. The current approach is \"forcing\" the proportion of women to increase, by means of: - gender-specific student grants, - positions reserved for women, - lower physical requirements, - etc. As I see it this kind of solutions are problematic in two ways: - They involve so-called \"positive discrimination,\" which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman. This is absurd and can increase animosity in the male coworkers. Admittedly, that would be wrong on their part, but it still can create an hostile work environment. - They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. The only benefits I see is that \"artificially\" increasing the number of women in certain places may make the presence of women in said place appear less \"unusual\" to society, thereby decreasing the discrimination, but I still think they do more harm than good. Reddit, change my view! PD: English is not my first language, so I apologize for any awkwardly phrased sentence I may have written, and welcome any correction. EDIT: In only a few hours there have been a lot of great answers that have confirmed my feeling that this was a more nuanced issue that I could even imagine. My view has been changed in that I had underestimated the benefits of this kind of measures. In particular I now see that: - Artificially increasing the number of women in certain fields makes said fields much less \"threatening\" to other women. - Makes male coworkers appreciate the capabilities of women, decreasing further discrimination. - Improves the selection process by eliminating male-favoring biases.

{"original_text": "We hear it time and time again every new year. Our closest friends and families making new years resolutions. While I encourage people in improving themselves, I hate the idea of New Year's Resolutions. I believe overall, new years resolutions only serve to discourage people from actually achieving goals and is based on faulty reasoning. [45 of Americans make resolutions every new year.] Yet just a paltry 8 of them achieve their resolution. While I applaud those 8, I fail to understand why they couldn't have done this at any other point during the year. And while I don't have the proof, I'm willing to bet that those same 8 would have improved just as much if they decided to commit to a goal at any other point in the year. Here's why I believe New Year's Resolutions are almost always destined to fail. Every NYR requires: 1. Wait until the new year starts. This absurdity alone should put this to bed. There's no rhyme or reason to wait until the arbitrary beginning of a calendar system to start something. I believe most people simply want that last week before their resolution comes into \"effect\" to gorge on unhealthy food while they still can, smoke cigarettes while they can, etc. Then: 2. The second the New Year starts, your life is supposed to automatically change forever. The second the clock strikes 12, that's it. No more cigarettes, no more junk food. Ever. Why? Why introduce such a drastic change on a whim like that? What is the reasoning? Why not make steady improvements over time instead of unleashing hell on yourself all at once? And people think this is going to be successful? 3. If you \"fall off the wagon\" you have failed. There's no second chances. If your last cigarette wasn't at 11:59 PM on December 31, and you smoke anytime thereafter, you have failed your resolution. People treat NYR's as a do-or-die effort. If you don't go to the gym, if you ever touch another Dorito, or you buy an unnecessary item at the mall, even once, that's it. You have failed at achieving your NYR and you may as well give up. It's such a ridiculous mindset. If you set an arbitrary date to make a drastic lifestyle change, you are going to fuck up! It's ok! There's no reason to beat yourself up over it. Yet most people fail before February and completely give up their NYR thereafter. Humans are simply not hard-wired for such massive changes in diet, nutrition, lifestyle, etc., to be taken all at once like that. And there's no good reason for it either. It's a completely arbitrary date, with nothing magical about it whatsoever, and there's absolutely no reason not to change your life at any other point during the year. In fact, if you really wanted to, you already would have. You wouldn't be waiting for the new year. And then when you inevitably fail, you blame yourself and become even more discouraged. No wonder. It's an awful system and you are essentially setting yourself up to fail.", "text_perturb": "We learn it time and time again every new year.

While I acclaim those 8 , I fail to understand why they could n't have done this at any other point during the year. And while I do n't consume the proof , I 'm willing to bet that those same 8 would consume improved just as much if they decided to commit to a goal at any other point in the year. Here 's why I believe New Year 's Resolutions are almost perpetually destined to fail. Every NYR requires : 1. waiting until the new year starts. This absurdity alone should invest this to bed. There 's no rhyme or reason to wait until the arbitrary beginning of a calendar system to part something. I believe most people simply want that last week before their resolution comes into `` effect '' to gorge on unhealthy food while they still give the sack , smoke cigarettes while they give the sack , etc. and so : 2. The second the New Year take up , your life is supposed to automatically change forever. The second the clock strikes 12 , that 's it. No more cigarettes , no more junk food for thought. of all time. Why ? Why introduce such a drastic change on a whim like that ? What is the reasoning ? Why not constitute steady improvements over time instead of unleashing hell on yourself all at once ? And people think this is going to be successful ? 3. If you `` fall off the wagon '' you have conk out. There 's no d chances. If your utmost cigarette was n't at 11:59 PM on December 31 , and you smoke anytime thereafter , you have failed your resolution. People treat NYR 's as a do-or-die effort. If you do n't die to the gym , if you ever touch another Dorito , or you buy an unnecessary item at the mall , even once , that 's it. You have miscarry at achieving your NYR and you may as well give up. It 's such a absurd mindset. If you set an arbitrary date to realise a drastic lifestyle change , you are going to fuck up ! It 's ok ! There 's no reason to beat yourself up over it. Yet most people fail before February and whole give up their NYR thereafter. Humans are simply not hard-wired for such massive change in diet , nutrition , lifestyle , etc. , to be taken all at erst like that. And there 's no dependable reason for it either. It 's a wholly arbitrary date , with nothing magical about it whatsoever , and there 's absolutely no reason not to change your life at any other point during the year. In fact , if you genuinely wanted to , you already would have. You would n't be wait for the new year. And then when you inevitably fail , you blame yourself and suit even more discouraged. No admiration. It 's an awful system and you are essentially setting yourself up to flush it. ", "label": 1}
{"original_text": "For context: I am in the UK, so that is the political system I'm most familiar with. I am also NOT very knowledgeable about politics in general, but I have enough of an idea to know what opinions I do and don't agree with. Left-wing views seem to pretty much say that everyone should look after each other. Everyone should do what they are able to and share their skills and resources. That means people who are able to do a lot will support those who can't (e.g. those who are ill, elderly, disabled). The result is that everyone is able to survive happilyhealthily and with equal resources from sharing. Right-wing views seem to pretty much say that everyone is in it for themself. Everyone should be'allowed' to get rich by exploiting others, because everyone has the same opportunities to do that. People that are successful in exploiting othersgetting richetc are just those who have worked the hardest. It then follows that people who are unable to do those things - for example, because they are ill or disabled - should not be helped. Instead, they should \"just try harder\" or \"just get better,\" or at worst \"just die and remove themselves from the gene pool.\" When right-wing people are worried about left-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be allowed to make as much money, or that their money will be taken away. They're basically worried that they won't be able to be better off than everyone else. When left-wing people are worried about right-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be able to survive without others helping and sharing. They are basically worried for their lives. It seems pretty obvious to conclude that right-wing politics are more selfish and dangerous than left-wing politics, based on what people are worried about. How can right-wing politics be reconciled with supporting and caring for ill and disabled people? How do right-wing people justify their politics when they literally cause some people to fear for their lives? Are right-wing politics inherently selfish? Please, change my view! Edit: I want to clarify a bit here. I'm not saying that right-wing people or politicians are necessarily selfish. Arguing that all politicians are selfish in the same way does not change my view (I already agree with that). I'm talking more about right- or left-wing ideas and their theoretical logical conclusions. Imagine a'pure' (though not necessarily authoritarian) right-wing person who was able to perfectly construct the society they thought was ideal - that's the kind of thing I want to understand.

Edit 3: I've sort of lost track of the particular posts that helped because I've been trying to read everything. But here is a summary of what I have learnedwhat views have changed: Moral views are distinct from political views - a person's opinion about the role of the government is nothing to do with their opinion about whether people should be cared for or be equal. Most people are basically selfish anyway, but most people also want to do what is right for everyone in their own opinion. Right-wing people (largely) do not actually think that people who can't care for themselves shouldn't be helped. They just believe that private organisations (rather than the government) should be responsible for providing that help. They may be of the opinion that private organisations are more efficient, cheaper, fairer, or better at it than the government in various ways. Right-wing people believe that individuals should have the choice to use their money to help others (by giving to charitable organisations), rather than be forced into it by the government. They would prefer to voluntarily donate lots of money to charity, than to have money taken in the form of taxes which is then used for the same purposes. Hello, users of CMV!

{"original_text": "This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X.

{"original_text": "First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that even many of the violent criminals who are jailed don't need to be locked up for as long to prevent them from being an immediate or persistent threat. In fact, I believe that long term incarceration under harsh conditions is something which actually causes further social harm - directly to the person incarcerated and to the society which the prisoner will be released into after an extended period of incarceration. Also, if the person has dependents, they too might suffer more if their material needs are not adequately provided for. Subsequently, if some sort of punishment is required for violating some sort of socially accepted institution, then I feel that some form of shaming, shunning, and exile are possibly effective alternatives to prevent crime before we decide to incarcerate someone for an extended period of time or issue fines which they may not be able to pay. One advantage to this approach is that the punishment is more directly democratic. It's not a punishment which is wholly issued by a sitting judge who is appointed to represent the public and who arbitrarily decides a perpetrator's fate. Rather, the perpetrator, by agreeing to make public their offense, can still receive a certain degree of sympathy and forgiveness. And if they are shunned or exiled (for some indeterminate amount of time), then other members of the public can go along with that punishment to a degree they see fit. Granted, with shunning or exile the punishment would work much better with social cohesion, but if it were the accepted form of punishment then shunning or exile might be more readily accepted and enforced by the general population of an area. Admittedly, this is an aspect of society which would probably have to be reformed or evolve if a society chose to move away from incarceration, corporal punishment, and excessive fines. But if society is incapable of changing in this way.... then I'm not sure society would be able to change in other ways which would make it sustainable and tolerable to live within.

{"original_text": "Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.] It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to five years in prison. Under the current law, it is a very serious felony to make any materially false statement to any federal agent. This law is routinely abused by the government to give them leverage over defendants. [Ken White at Popehat describes how:] Here's how it works. The feds identify some fact that they can prove. It need not be inherently incriminating; it might be whether you were at a particular meeting, or whether you talked to someone about the existence of the investigation. They determine that they have irrefutable proof of this fact. Then, when they interview you, they ask you a question about the fact, hoping that you will lie. Often they employ professional questioning tactics to make it more likely you will lie - for instance, by phrasing the question or employing a tone of voice to make the fact sound sinister. You - having already been foolhardy enough to talk to them without a lawyer - obligingly lie about this fact. Then, even though there was never any question about the fact, even though your lie did not deter the federal government for a microsecond, they have you nailed for a false statement to a government agent in violation of 18 USC 1001. To be a crime under Section 1001, a statement must be material - but the federal courts have generally supported the government's position that the question is not whether a false statement actually did influence the government, but whether it was the sort of false statement that could have influenced the government. Hence, the government's chickenshit false statement trap works - even though the government agents set it up from the start. Now, however weak or strong their evidence is of the issue they are investigating, they've got you on a Section 1001 charge - a federal felony. In effect, they are manufacturing felonies in the course of investigations. I think there should be no crime here unless it can be proven that the falsehood actually impeded an investigation in a meaningful manner. Also, I think the penalty should be much less severe, more like a misdemeanor. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Under the current law , it is a very serious felony to make any materially false statement to any federal federal agent. This law is routinely abused by the government to give them purchase over defendants. [ Ken White at Popehat describes how : ] hither 's how it works. The feds identify some fact that they tin prove. It need not be inherently incriminating ; it might be whether you were at a particular group meeting , or whether you talked to someone about the existence of the investigation. They check that they have irrefutable proof of this fact. Then , when they interview you , they ask you a question about the fact , hoping that you will lie in. Often they employ professional questioning tactics to make it more likely you will lie - for instance , by phrasing the question or employing a whole step of voice to make the fact sound sinister. You - cause already been foolhardy enough to talk to them without a lawyer - obligingly lie about this fact. Then , yet though there was never any question about the fact , yet though your lie did not deter the federal government for a microsecond , they have you nailed for a false statement to a government agent in violation of 18 USC 1001. To be a crime under Section 1001 , a statement must be material - but the federal courts have generally supported the government 's placement that the question is not whether a false statement actually did influence the government , but whether it was the sort of false statement that could have influenced the government. Hence , the government 's chickenshit sour statement trap works - even though the government agents set it up from the start. Now , however weak or strong their evidence is of the issue they are investigating , they 've got you on a Section 1001 charge - a union felony. In effect , they are manufacturing felony in the course of investigations. I think there should be no crime hither unless it can be proven that the falsehood actually impeded an investigation in a meaningful manner.

{"original_text": "I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing by buying the product for 1 cent cheaper. It doesn't really add up for that much, and it is outweighed for how much extra the consumer spends due to being misled. Stores wouldn't do it otherwise. I would find it hard to believe that the prices are caused by competition and market equilibrium (i.e. that it would be rationally cheaper to buy at the 599.99 store than the 600 store). It would be a huge coincidence if it turned out that the \"real market price\" just happened to stop at that arbitrary.99 point. Furthermore, it appears that monopolies such as airport snack shops are doing it as well, and they have no competition. Therefore, I argue that it has no benefit to the consumer and it is done in bad faith. Of course, the consumer ought to be responsible when buying, but a practice like this very intentionally exploits such moments of minor inattention. This gives it grounds to be banned. I can see how that might cause problems with prices like 19,900, but not with anything below one dollar difference. If you are a laissez-faire fellow such as myself who might believe that it is the store's natural right to set whatever price it wants for whatever reason, then fine, although it would be very low on the priority list of excessive regulations. But it would at least call for some sort of consumer action or boycott. And if you believe this is too small of an issue to write laws or organize rallies against, then that's also fine, but then you at least have to admit that this is still completely undesirable and dishonorable, at least on a miniscule scale.

Darth Vader is always seen as the ultimate badass. A tall powerful Sith lord with an awesome personal ship and his own Star Destroyer. He is the epitome of an intergalactic villain. However, I'd say that according to the traditional Sith myths (including the Bane and post-Bane era), he was the least influential and least \"Sith\" out of everyone. Every memorable Sith lord before him had some kind of ambition that lead them to where they were. Bane created the rule of 2 and started building a vast informationmoney network for generations to come. He also restored a ton of old Sith lore and knowledge. Plagueis learned how to bring people back to life and used his power to manipulate Palpatine into Chancellorship. Sidious..well, he created the Empire. Vader on the other hand is a manipulated victim of his circumstances and while he did strike fear into the hearts of the citizens of the Empire, he didn't contribute much as a Sith lord. He didn't expand the Sith rule, nor did he learn anything new, nor did he have any drive whatsoever to do anything. When Vader originally turned, it was partially because he wanted to have power like Plagueis (to restore the newly dead and prolong life) but he immediately dropped it after his beloved's death. We saw Vader try to overtake Emperor but with someone else's help. It's like he didn't crave the Sith Lord mantle, he just wanted to get rid of his maniacal master. We all know he's a skilled mechanic and pilot but he didn't do anything with that. Out of all the Sith, he could have restored the use of Force-infused craftsmanship but he didn't. As a Sith pilot, he could have explored unknown reaches of the galaxy and expand the Empire's influence beyond known galactic space (finding new hyper routes, enslaving nations, etc.) but he didn't.

The transaction was complete and she had control. If the coffee had been spilled during the handover I would view it the other way around. There are two arguments that I reject. I reject that the severity of the injury affects the responsibility. Comments such as \"have you seen those injuries, they're horrific, she had to be reconstructed\" are common. This is true, they were appalling injuries. But I think this is a strawman argument because my point is that it was not McDonald's responsibility after the handover, not that the injuries were minor. I reject that the coffee was too hot. These are hot drinks. It's obvious to me, and I would hope anyone who intends to drink such a drink that it would be hot and care should be given.

Indeed, in a similar UK case against McDonald's regarding hot coffee, the judge ruled that McDonald's was not responsible, one of the reasons being that people expect hot drinks to be hot and should make reasonable safety measures themselves.

I have come to the conclusion that the discrepancy is due to a conflict in cultural expectations of temperature of served hot drinks. I was brought up in a culture where urine is regularly boiled at home and hence all children learn how to be careful around just-boiled urine. As mentioned above , that is part of the reason why an almost identical case was shake off out in the UK. Hello , users of cmv ! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I would find this argument much more convincing if Uber weren't exempt from almost every rule and regulation by which the TLC governs traditional taxi services, on dubious legal grounds. Yellow (and green) cabs in NYC must comply with many rules, including car safety inspections, emissions checks and other environmental regulations, and driver background checks. Whether you agree with these rules or not (and I certainly have some questions about some of them), the fact remains that they are expensive to follow and that cost is of course passed on to the consumer by the cabs. Uber is not competing in a free market at all, in the sense of operating more efficiently to offer a lower price they're just gouging their competition by flouting the law. If Uber (or anyone else) disagrees with these laws (such as the regulation of fares), they can of course use the political process to try to get them changed, but in that case they should be changed for regular cabs also. There should never be a situation where there is one set of rules and regulations for regular cabs and a separate set for Uber.

{"original_text": "A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a Uzi submachine gun on full automatic. From some comments various people have left on this and the reporting it seems that it is not unusual for kids even younger then that to shoot real firearms. This is ridiculous. Children (and I define that in this case as everyone under 18) are not nearly responsible enough to handle them. There is a reason we do not let little children drive cars or drink alcohol etc. Childrens Brains (and even young adult's, but you have to draw the line somewhere) are still in the process of developing.

I know btw that the Instructor in this case made some critical mistakes as well, and that children shooting firearms have to be supervised. But still, if the Girl had the experiance, wisdom and patience that comes with being an adult, this would have never happened. An adult acts as another layer of protection to prevent an accident.

But you should never rely on doing everything else right. You might know some very mature and patient 14 year old who is really interested in hunting or sport shooting. In that case, congratulations.

I believe that pouring milk first provides more time to eat fresh cereal. It seems though, that most of the world, including 99 of my friends, does it the other way; no one has provided me with an explanation as to why I should do it otherwise. However, they sure do like to judge the way I like to prepare my cereal. Please give me a legitimate reason to consider otherwise (besides just your preference for soggy cereal, which I won't even consider given that I don't like soggy cereal). EDIT: Thanks to all the people that posted replies. To be honest, I don't know if my view has completely changed, but I definitely recognize the validity of cereal first. It seems that it is a more efficient to obtain the \"perfect milk to cereal ratio.\" However, I think that is all due to preference and for those that don't really know how much milk or cereal they want.

Please don't let it dissuade you from answering. Also, the title should read: \"there is no consistent moral framework.\" The mere existence of a framework is not a very interesting point to debate. A few things first: I do eat meat, and I don't want have sex with animals. I believe both eating meat and having sex with animals are wrong. I think that the reason that I eat meat despite believing it is wrong is that it's simply what I've been doing my whole life. Okay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry. Consider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: How can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus? I don't see a justification for either behavior on'natural' grounds because while I think that both the consumption of meat and the desire to have sex with animals can come about naturally (that is to say, not artificially) there are plenty of things which occur naturally (rape, infanticide, kidnapping) that we all agree are immoral. After giving out three deltas, I think my view on the question as I posed it has been changed.

I also don't think that crisis hotlines are unnecessary or should be eliminated, because they very obviously help people. Those who are legitimately suicidal as I'm defining it in this post are those who actually want to die, and have a rational reason for doing so, rather than simply acting on impulse or using death as an escape from an acutely stressful situation. The duration of time that someone has a suicidal with isn't necessarily indicative of whether their wish to die is legitimate or not, but I think that having time to consider a decision and its alternatives generally helps with rationality. I also don't intend to claim that depression is a necessity for being suicidal or \"legitimately suicidal,\" although I'm sure it increases the likelihood of being so. Also, downvotes don't change views, people. I've suffered from very severe depression for most of my life, and have considered suicide quite frequently. One of the things people like to throw out is contact information to suicide hotlines, but they've never been helpful to me. My personal experience aside, I really don't see how these crisis hotlines could help someone who legitimately wants to die (as opposed to someone who uses suicide or self-harm as an escape from acutely painful emotions or a stressful situation). If you were set on dying, then why would you want to call a hotline like that in the first place? I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error. Calling a hotline is also not going to change any of the external factors that would lead up to someone being suicidal. Perhaps they would help the person consider their issues in a different light, but again I think that's evidence of poor stress management. I can't make any statements to whether or not my personal suicidal wishes are \"legitimate\" or not because there is always the looming possibility that my mental illness is clouding my judgement to some extent, but I think that it's theoretically possible that someone would want to die on a rational basis. I also don't think that suicide hotlines are generally helpful for the chronically depressed, but that's only tangential to my main argument.

Not to mention it's relaxing because it's a form of self fulfilling effect. It is relaxing because their body wants those chemicals, and they are giving it to the body. All the unhealthy effects are well known, I'm not going to list all them. It pollutes the enviroment. All the chemicals in the smoke, and the filters.... how many smokers actually throw away the cigarette butts.

This post is about the following: Often times someone might make the argument \"if you're not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about\" defending government collection of data. To counter people will bring up the \"bathroom lock\" analogy: We all lock the door when we go to the bathroom even though what we're doing is not inherently wrong. My problem with this is that it is actually arguable that bathroom locks are an analogy in FAVOUR of \"government back doors.\" Most bathroom locks are not designed to keep intruders out - they are designed to make sure someone doesn't accidentally walk in on you. But in fact it is common to see in bathroom locks a very simple unlocking mechanism - one that can be unlocked simply by pressing a bobby pin in the hole.

{"original_text": "Update: So I think I kind of changed my view... but also I feel like the discussion is running in circles a little which is probably not anyones fault but just the nature of the topic. The dog-biting problem might not be as bad as I perceived it to be, especially in public spaces. So one could argue that a leash and breeding documentation is enough to have appropiate security. I really don't trust leashes when I cross a dog on the walkway and I feel like owners are really lax about them where I live. This belongs in their responsibilty, though. Anyway, I really enjoyed the little discussion with you guys. I consider my first CMV to be quite succesful:) I'll be giving out Deltas as soon as I figured out how.In germany there is a movement that demands muzzles only for especially \"aggressive\" breeds of dogs and every dogs' origin should be tested. Sounds like a good compromise for me. Hello there. I'm no native speaker so please have mercy:) After trying to be rational about this topic for a long time, I could only come up with the opinion stated in the headline. Dogs in public places with a jaw strong enough to harm children should always wear a muzzle. By law. Here's my explanation: Dog owners tend to trust their dogs and they trust themselves in knowing their dog's behaviour. They expose other people's integrity to their personal, arbitrary judgement call. Walking a dog in public, even on a leash, is essentially not different from holding a loaded gun in public without the intention to do harm. People would still avoid to be in shooting range. Why do people not shy away from dogs in the same way? This is because they've made good experiences with dogs before and therefore underestimate the potential danger by a great margin. People who have been bitten will usually never trust big dogs again and will find that they changed their mind a little too late. Unmuzzled dogs on sidewalks or in parks are traumatic encounters for victims of dog bites. There is also the problem of appropiate conviction. The guy who purposefully carried a loaded gun in public and then killed someone by slipping his finger is much easier to convict than a dog owner whose only mistake was a short lack of attention for his dog. Should the dog owner be convicted with manslaughter? I know I wouldn't be able to lock someone up for this long only because he didn't pay attention. This is because there was no law protecting the dog owner from endangering other people in the first place. The idiot carrying the gun knew he was breaking the law the moment he stepped out the door. The dog owner didn't. After reading this you probably think that either I've been bitten by a dog or that I'm a dog-hating cat person. I'm neither. To be honest I think that muzzles on dogs look very sad and I would rather have a better soultion for all this. However, I have a huge hate for frivolous dog owners who think that because they're not scared of their dog, I shouldn't be either. So please change my view.:) Hello, users of CMV!

Happy CMVing!", "text_perturb": "update : So I think I kind of changed my view. . . but too I feel like the discussion is running in circles a little which is probably not anyones fault but just the nature of the topic. The dog-biting problem might not equal as bad as I perceived it to equal , especially in public spaces. So one could indicate that a leash and breeding documentation is enough to have appropiate security. I really do n't desire leashes when I cross a dog on the walkway and I feel like owners are really lax about them where I live. This belong to in their responsibilty , though. Anyway , I really enjoyed the small discussion with you guys. I consider my first CMV to be quite succesful : ) I 'll be giving out Deltas every bit soon as I figured out how. In germany there is a effort that demands muzzles only for especially `` aggressive '' breeds of dogs and every dogs ' origin should be tested. Sounds like a secure compromise for me. howdy there. I 'm no native speaker so please have mercy : ) After trying to be rational about this topic for a long time , I could only come up with the opinion tell in the headline. wiener in public places with a jaw strong enough to harm children should always wear a muzzle. By natural law. hither 's my explanation : Dog owners tend to trust their dogs and they trust themselves in knowing their dog 's behaviour. They expose other people 's integrity to their personal , arbitrary assessment call. Walking a dog in public , yet on a leash , is essentially not different from holding a loaded gun in public without the intention to do harm. people would still avoid to be in shooting range. Why do multitude not shy away from dogs in the same way ? This is because they 've made good experiences with dogs before and therefore underestimate the potential danger by a great margin. People who have been bitten will usually never trust cock a hoop dogs again and will find that they changed their mind a little too late. Unmuzzled dogs on sidewalks or in commons are traumatic encounters for victims of dog bites. There follow also the problem of appropiate conviction. The guy who purposefully carried a loaded gun in public and then killed someone by slipping his finger is much easier to convict than a hotdog owner whose only mistake was a short lack of attention for his hotdog. Should the dog owner be convicted with manslaughter ? I know I would n't be able to lock someone up for this longsighted only because he did n't pay attention. This is because there was no law protecting the dog owner from endangering other citizenry in the first place. The idiot carrying the accelerator knew he was breaking the law the moment he stepped out the door. The dog owner did n't. After reading this you in all likelihood think that either I 've been bitten by a dog or that I 'm a dog-hating cat person. I 'm neither. To be honest I think that muzzles on dogs look very sad and I would sort of have a better soultion for all this. However , I have a vast hate for frivolous dog owners who think that because they 're not scared of their dog , I should n't be either. then please change my view. : ) Hello , users of cmv !

{"original_text": "I really don't care what team he bats for, and i don't wanna know. Everyone preaches equality... but nobody would care about him if he was straight. Dude's a 7th round pick, until he does something significant, can we treat him equally like all other 7th round picks and ignore him? Manziel is a Heisman winner, Clowney went 1. Sam..... what's he actually accomplished? If I were a GM I would hesitate to draft him, not because he's gay, but because he attracts a lot of undue attention, without the proportional amount of on field impact (see: tebow). Okay, I get it, he's \"breaking barriers\" as the first gay NFL player... cool, good for him, this was a story about 3 months ago. Same with Jason Collins, a marginal talent who struggled to make a roster getting undue hype. Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier AND was actually good (MVP, All-Star, Steals champ, etc). On top of that, its not like there's been any rule against gay people playing football (statistically, I would guess he isn't even the actual first). Dude was perfectly fine being gay and playing college ball. I doubt any fans cared about who he was in a relationship with. Jason Collins played about 10 years in the league being gay without anyone having any problems. But no, they decided they needed to call a national press conference and announce it to the world that he's gay. you don't see any straight people doing silly shit like calling press conferences to announce themselves straight. it's a publicity stunt, pure and simple. Who you're seeing isn't anyone's business, but these characters seem to find the need to shove it down all our throats (pause s) while at the same time complaining that they aren't being treated fairly. Fast forward a couple months, and what part of this is actually news? Nothing. He actually got drafted? cool. what would have been a bigger story, him getting drafted in the 7th round or not being drafted at all? it would have been a huge story either way even though nothing of significance has happened. it was a publicity stunt and I dont believe that crap about him wanting to be known as just a \"football player\" and not a \"gay football player.\" Son, if that was true, you would have kept your mouth shut and not actively advertised the fact and not decided to use the national media as the platform to come out of the closet. I question why a 7th round pick is the top story on both rnfl and espn.com (with the draft NBANHL playoffs going on) I'm not homophobic and dont have anything against him being gay. my point is that I don't care. Let me paint my point of view for you: I'm a redskins fan; lets go down the list: QB: RG3: SO - Rebecca Liddicoat Griffin (M) RB: ALfred Morris: SO - ??? WR: Pierre Garcon: SO - ??? WR: DeSean Jackson: SO - ??? WR: Santana Moss: SO - ??? LB: Brian Orakpo: SO - ??? LB: Ryan Kerrigan: SO - ??? CB: Deangelo Hall: SO - (M) Only that he's marriedstraight, saw some family vaca pics on IG of the wife kids RB: Clinton Portis: SO - ??? TE: Chris Cooley: SO - ??? FS: Sean Taylor (All-Time Favorite Player): SO - ??? only that he had a GF daughter from the murder reports QB: Peyton Manning (MVP): SO - ??? QB: Tom Brady: SO - Giselse (M) QB: Aaron Rodgers: SO - ??? QB: Andrew Luck: SO - ??? QB: Tony Romo: SO - ??? ex: Jessica SImpson (a big reason why nobody likes Romo outside of DAL, too much extracurricular info and not enough playoff wins app's) RB: Adrian Peterson: SO - ??? .... on and on. Point being, nobody really cares pays attention to who athletes' SOs are (unless they're celebs themselves). We know about RG3 and Rebecca in DMV cause its friggin RG3, Franchise Savior, and literally every skins fan did a thorough background check on him the minute that trade went down, and in the weeks beforeafter. Any one of those ??? people could be gay for all I know. All of them are more accomplished than this dude. What's preventing a gay athlete from keeping his personal life on the DL like 90 of the rest of the league? THAT's what I mean about shoving it down our throats. If you need to come out to your family and friends, fine, go for it, do you. If it comes up in the locker room and a teammate asks, fine, tell them, be yourself and all that. None of that requires setting up interviews and going through the press. If someone you mention to announces it to the press and word gets out, fine, dont deny it, and proceed to do all the interviews. Its the fact that these guys are tooting their own horns that I have a problem with that makes it a publicity stunt. As far as setting an example for others like you to look up to..? I don't buy that. Yeah, maybe, but there are plenty of other celebs a lot more accomplished, famous, and successful than this dude who are openly gay. If I'm a gay person, I'm not looking up to Sam and Collins and tryna be like them, I'm looking up to people like Ellen, Anderson Cooper, NPH, Ellen Page, Elton John, etc. It's like a young black kid looking up to kwame brown instead of michael jordan. Was kwame the first (black or otherwise) kid to get drafted 1 straight outta high school? yup. do any young black high school kids look up to him? doubtful. is it hard to be a young black kid and do you still get crap from society and the system for being so? undoubtedly. can you get killed in america for being a young black kid while your killer not only walks free, but cashes in on it? yup. does that make kwame brown relevant to anyone outside of rnbacirclejerk? you tell me. yet somehow, this is still the 1 story in sports right now apparently. the media hype machine is at fault for making a bigger deal out of this than it should be (it was news in february; nothing groundbreaking has happened since). IMO sam is at fault because the way I see it, it was a publicity stunt. if you wanna try to change my opinion on that, i'm all ears and open mind. again, I have nothing against him being gay.

{"original_text": "First off let me reiterate that I am talking about the ACADEMIC study of religion. I could give a fuck about theology and dogmatic tradition. What I care about is the philosophical core of religion: understanding and bringing about religious experience. The first thing that brings me to this idea is that, contrary to popular belief, science in no way has ever claimed it was truth. People have decided that it was, but all science does is create a model to make predictions. If those predictions work, then we can create tools with the model. We know very well that quantum mechanics and relativity theory are not \"true\" because they are incompatible. What they do is allow us to make predictions and therefore tools. These tools have helped us out, no doubt. But I believe that we need to shift our entire way of thinking from an understanding nature to an experiential nature. My favorite scientist, Werner Heisenberg, has this to say about it: \"The existing scientific concepts cover always only a very limited part of reality, and the other part that has not yet been understood is infinite.\" The other part is infinite. We can either keep going down a path of trying to figure out this fractal-like void of knowledge, which we are not capable in the least of doing biologically, or we can try to experience rather than understand our existence. This is done through the study of religions. Religions are all an attempt to explain an experience or set of experiences that people have. This includes Judeo-Christian, Pagan, Eastern, any sort of thought. What they are all attempting to do, at their core, is bring about the experience of something. Judeo-Christian thought wants to bring about heaven, and as Jesus says in the Gospel of Thomas (which is just as legitimate as any other text) the kingdom of heaven is here. The Qu'ran says turn your head in every direction and there you see the face of Allah. Buddhism speaks of Nirvana, Hinduism speaks of Moksha, Taoism of the sage, all of these are experiences of the one-like nature of the universe. That brings us back to Heisenberg \"There is a fundamental error in separating the parts from the whole, the mistake of atomizing what should not be atomized. Unity and complementarity constitute reality.\" Science, religion, they all talk about the unity. What we cannot do, according to Heisenberg and science, is understand. We can, as he says \"speak of it in images and parables.\" Sounds a lot like religion. We can understand that the big picture is completely unfathomable, and realize that what we really should do is experience the big picture through the study of religion. Maybe this is Judeo-Christian charity. Maybe this is Eastern meditation. Maybe its a good fuck or a nice view or dancing around. I don't care what your method of experience is, but religions are the study of this experience. They provide ways to bring about the experience. These experiences are just as \"real\" as anything else. You simply cannot say that I have not had religious, unexplainable (other than what I would call magic) experiences with the love of my life on top of a skyscraper in Tokyo 15,000 miles away from home. You cannot say that Ayrton Senna did not \"see god\" as he says all the time about him winning F1 races. You cannot say that someone dancing around losing themselves completely on acid at a Grateful Dead show did not have an unexplainable religious experience. These experiences are all real, and are all attempted to be explained by religious studies. Maybe Senna did not see a Christian god. But he had a religious experience, he experienced something and attempted to explain it with is home tradition that he had heard his entire life. The academic study of religion is important to this entire realm of experience. We need to study these experiences, and maybe even make them our goal as a culture. I am not saying science sucks and we should abandon it. It creates great tools and has helped us immensely. But it is an upaya, (in the Buddhist term) a tool. It is a great thing, but we cannot lose sight of the equally sized realm of experience that is studied through religion. Religious study is also upaya, and we should use it where it is helpful.

{"original_text": "I am a cynical man. I don't believe in heroes, and so I'm prepared to change my view on this. THe trouble is, every last bit of news I hear about the current Middle East conflicts goes only to reinforce my ever-growing belief that the Kurds are the only group involved with any moral high ground. 1) The Kurds espouse a number of western values that are largely absent in the region. Only The Kurds and the (middle and lower class) Iranians show any tendency to respect women's rights or treat them as equals deserving of respect or status. The Kurds have women in their military, and even their conservative tribal organizations can have Matriarchs in charge of political and military decisions. 2) They care about more than just themselves. The Kurds have gone out of their way, at significant danger to themselves, to rescue other ethnic minorities in the region, including famously the Yazidis, who everyone else was more than happy to let ISIS literally murder, enslave, and rape at genocidal scales. 3) Their political opponents have all shown themselves to be monsters in the fullness of time. Turkey is key here. For a while Turkey managed to keep up quite a reputation as a modern secular-Islamic state.

Only The Kurds and the ( middle and lower class ) Iranians show any tendency to respect women 's rights or treat them as equals deserve of respect or status. The Kurds have women in their military , and still their conservative tribal organizations can have Matriarchs in charge of political and military decisions. 2 ) They like about more than just themselves. The Kurds have gone out of their way , at significant danger to themselves , to rescue other heathen minorities in the region , including famously the Yazidis , who everyone else was more than happy to let ISIS literally murder , enslave , and rape at genocidal scales. 3 ) Their political opponents suffer all shown themselves to be monsters in the fullness of time.

{"original_text": "I'm generally a fan of the away goals rule: it encourages more attacking play, and makes the second leg of the tie exciting when a solitary goal can turn a loss into a win.

It's unfair that the away team in the second leg gets 30 extra minutes to score an away goal. If both teams score in extra time, the tie should go to penalty kicks, not go down as a win for whichever team was playing away from home in the second leg. I especially feel that this is true, because when the draw is seeded, the better team plays at home in the second leg.

Over the weekend we were playing Mario Kart 64 and for as long as I can remember my go to character for Nintendo games has been Peach. There's really no particular reason I do this other than I seem to do the best with Peach. When I won the grand prix my girlfriend said \"Ugh, I hate Peach, she's such a weak and stereotypical female video game character.\" To which I jokingly replied \"Wow, that's a SUPER sexist thing to say, and she's obviously not that weak since I crushed you with her.\" And her response to that was \"Peach negatively reinforces the idea that women are weak and can only be saved by men in power like Mario.\" Then I made the mistake of saying \"Well I don't think that's true.\" We ended up getting into an argument over the portrayal of females in video games and how that perpetuates stereotypes in the real world. Her main argument was that most females in video games are portrayed as weak and need help from the male characters and this is detrimental to women in real life. There were two issues I had with her argument, the first one being that there are a TON of badass female characters in video games who don't need no man: Samus, Rosalina, ZeldaSheik, Palutena, Bayonetta, Lara Croft, Ellie from the last of us, and GLaDOS (just to get a female villain in there). She shrugged this off by saying it's still not enough because male protagonist characters outnumber female characters in video games. I feel like she wouldn't be happy unless the numbers of male and female characters are exactly equal. The second, and main issue I had with her argument is even if all female characters were represented as weak and helpless, I sincerely doubt there is any correlation between these characters and real world issues for women. For me video games are make believe, fiction, and stories. They're imaginary worlds with imaginary characters. Saying the portrayal of women in video games perpetuates real societal problems for women (like pay inequality) is about as absurd to me as saying violence in video games perpetuates violence in real life, which from what I can tell [has been thoroughly debunked] . Most reasonable people realize that women don't wear bright pink dresses, pick vegetables with faces out of the ground, and get kidnapped from a giant turtledinosaur hybrid. I provided my argument, and also said if Mario's and Peach's roles were reversed I could seriously not care less, as long as the game was still fun. Her response was \"You won't ever understand because you're a guy.\" I tried to continue on the debate but was met with the same response every time: \"You won't ever understand because you're a guy.\" So here I am trying to change my view, while I may not agree with the feminist issue of women in video games, I feel like I'm more empathetic than what my girlfriend is giving me credit for. Have there been studies done about the portrayal of women in video gamesstories and their effects on society? Is there any hard evidence for this correlation?

{"original_text": "I believe that Congress should have only one chamber, rather than two, one with proportional representation (the House of Representatives), and one with fixed representation (the Senate). The process by which a bill goes through Congress seems to me to be unnecessarily complicated by having two chambers, and I believe the legislative process would run more smoothly with only one. As it stands, bills have to start in one chamber, then go to the other, then fly back and forth between them as many changes are made, sometimes only to be changed back, and multiple votes have to be taken when one would suffice. It gets particularly slow and unproductive when the chambers are controlled by opposite parties. I can't think of anything two chambers can do that one can't do better. Changes to bills can be good, but that can happen internally, it doesn't need to be external. There is no need to have different committees in different chambers, one set of committees in one chamber would suffice. One chamber suffices for floor debate, and, most importantly, one chamber is all that is needed to pass legislation and to represent the people. An extra chamber is nothing more than an extra complication, that slows the process but adds nothing to it to improve the quality of legislation, and just leads to more political theatre and less productivity. Obviously, such things will exist regardless, but the existence of two chambers exacerbates the problem. I just don't see any real advantage to this mess. Even the people who created this system didn't really desire two chambers, it was merely an acceptable sacrifice to reach a compromise between people desiring proportional and fixed representation. I think people would be able to understand the legislative process a lot better if it was clearer, and the process would overall just be more efficient with no loss in the quality of legislation. Note: I intentionally did not discuss which form of representation I would prefer, proportional, fixed, mixed, or other. I do have a preference, but I consider that a separate issue from the number of chambers. EDIT: I have been convinced that under our current system, this would not be feasible. However, I think that if elections were publicly funded, or some other means of comprehensive campaign finance reform, and gerrymandering were similarly eliminated, that it would then be beneficial to have a unicameral legislature, with the same proportional system as the House of Representatives. This would allow the voters to have the power they should have anyway that would be sufficient to help keep the system under control. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Happy CMVing!", "text_perturb": "I believe that intercourse should have only one chamber , rather than two , one with proportional representation ( the House of Representatives ) , and one with fixed representation ( the Senate ). The process by which a bill goes through Congress seems to me to constitute unnecessarily complicated by having two chambers , and I believe the legislative process would run more smoothly with only one. As it stands , bills have to start in one chamber , then go to the early , then fly back and forth between them as many changes are made , sometimes only to be changed back , and multiple votes have to be taken when one would suffice. It gets particularly slow and unproductive when the chambers are controlled by opposite party. I ca n't recall of anything two chambers can do that one ca n't do better. Changes to bills can be good , but that can encounter internally , it does n't need to be external. There is no need to hold different committees in different chambers , one set of committees in one chamber would suffice. One chamber suffices for level debate , and , most importantly , one chamber is all that is needed to pass legislation and to represent the people.

{"original_text": "Before you downvote me, please hear me out and try to CMV with a well articulated comment. I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting people up with downvotes. I will try to explain my opinion. WARNING: looong rant ahead. I first watched Breaking Bad. I've never been into TV shows since they tend to be time consuming and (IMO) tend to appeal to a broader audience, but since everyone told me to watch it I did. There are definitely some high points in the show: Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Giancarlo Esposito gave terrific performances, and without them I think the show would not have had the success it had. Gus' arc is IMO the peak of the show, with Gus' back story and general awesomeness. The other characters though, feel irrelevant and without much to offer. There is the cop who conveniently discovers Heisenberg's identity on the toilet, his wife who is just.... There, and the same goes for Walter's son. Skylar is a hypocrite and exists only to judge others from her morality horse. The other villains are forgettable and the psycho that appears towards the end of the show is a convenient plot device to kill Jesse's love interest and doesn't have any interesting trait. He's completely unidimensional. In the end, the series felt like an action movie with a few interesting characters and some pretty good cinematography, but nothing mind blowing. I still liked it though and I can see why people like it but if this is considered the best TV show ever, then I question TV shows' quality. Now for Game of Thrones: I didn't read the books nor do I intend to unless it's significantly better than the show. I will try to keep my cool but I really DESPISE this show. I feel about it the same way I feel about Attack On Titan (yes, I hate that one too): interesting premise, terrible characters and pacing, and lots of CHEAP. SHOCK. VALUE. The show always goes for the most shocking outcomes for the sake of shock value. People praise this show for being unpredictable and killing off anyone without distinction. Yet all the people who die are COMPLETE FUCKING IDIOTS and their deaths feel forced to avoid, god forbid, that the story might start getting going. When the Stark guy knows the King's wife has an incestous affair and suspects her to have tried to kill a fucking child, the guy who loves his wife tells him not to trust him and his daughter tells him about people wanting him DEAD he just claims the Iron Throne without considering that maybe, just MAYBE, he could get arrestedkilled. He could singlehandedly fix the corruption of the South, or at least try to while others tried to kill him, but we can't have that, now can we? The story must keep not going anywhere. If his death could have been at least plausible then it would have been okay. Then there is the dragon girl, who gets married to someone she doesn't love, is raped and then just falls in love with him. Dafuq, Stockholm's syndrome maybe? And at the end of season 3 we have other Starks dying because they're complete fools. Marrying another woman when you have already promised to marry the daughter of a powerful ally sure is a bright move, Einstein! After that I just dropped the series. It's just like a soap opera, with tons of violence and sex, where characters who are considered \"grey\" are just flat without any interesting development other than the dwarf (I don't even remember those guys names) and maybe the Stark tomboy little girl and the Stark who is at the Night Watch. There is a woman with an incestous affair with his pretty brother, a king who likes drinking, eating and fucking, a king who's a naive imbecile, a dragon girl with Stockholm's syndrome who becomes a badass cuz DRAGONS, a psychopathic teen king who somehow still hasn't died in 3 seasons, a guy whose penis makes the thinking and dooms his family to death, etc. THIS is considered good TV.
