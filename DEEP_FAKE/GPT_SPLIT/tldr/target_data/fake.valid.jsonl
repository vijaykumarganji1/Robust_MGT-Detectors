{"original_text": "Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network that specializes in processing sequences. A common application of RNNs is for Natural Language Processing due to its effectiveness at handling sequential data such as text. RNNs work by passing information along a chain of neurons, where each neuron receives input from the previous neuron and outputs to the next neuron. This allows the network to maintain a \"memory\" of the previous inputs and the order in which they were presented. One significant advantage of RNNs is their ability to handle varying length input sequences, making them suitable for tasks such as text generation, machine translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and many others. However, a common issue with RNNs is the vanishing gradient problem, which can occur when the gradients become too small, making it difficult for the network to learn long-term dependencies. To overcome this issue, various modifications to the basic RNN architecture have been developed, such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which have proven to be effective in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem while maintaining the benefits of RNNs.", "text_perturb": "Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network that narrow in processing sequences.
