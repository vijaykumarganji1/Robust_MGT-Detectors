The light activates the cells in the bio-ink. Depending on the cell type, this technique can be used to repair damaged spinal cords, nerve fibers, or blood vessels.

For example , if you had a note taking app today that needed to sync data across multiple devices , a service like Google Docs or Evernote or whatever would run a central server in the cloud , and all of your devices would bespeak data from and send data to the central cloud server when you wanted to take notes. In this new internet , you would endure your own Solid POD ( basically just a server I think ? ) and Solid would define a set of protocols for you to grant readwrite access to your Solid POD to all of these third party applications. Thus , if you wanted to write a Google DocsEvernote for this new internet , you would essentially but write front end code that interacted with each individual 's Solid POD as a backend ( instead of having your backend servers ) through the Solid POD APIs. Solid PODs fire also be used for authentication , and you fire have multiple PODs to prevent data loss. ", "label": 1}
