A group of researchers from the US have developed a non-silicon version of the hardware that uses hydrogen and a nickel metal. Controlling the amount of h can switch the device among four different states , which is useful for neural-network operations. The resulting hardware can train many types of systems with few resources than silicon hardware without losing performance. While the hardware shows substantial improvements over silicon systems , it is unlikely that it will be used commercially anytime soon. ", "label": 1}

The number of people dying from bacterial infections could grow from 700,000 annually last year to 10 million annually by 2050. Bacteria evolves resistance against antibiotics over time, and this process is accelerated by overuse. Felix, a biotech startup, believes that it can program viruses to target specific sites in bacteria, killing bad bacteria and halting its ability to evolve and become more resistant. The treatment is now in trials. This approach can potentially re-sensitize bacteria to traditional antibiotics.", "text_perturb": "As COVID-19 grabs the attention of the human race , the war against antibiotic-resistant bacteria wages on.
