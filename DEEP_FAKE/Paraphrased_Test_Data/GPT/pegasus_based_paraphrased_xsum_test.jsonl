{"original_text": "Islamic tradition requires the dead to be buried as soon as possible, unless an autopsy is required. The US military took this requirement very seriously, burying the body within hours. \"Traditional procedures for Islamic burial were followed,\" an official said. Religious rites were carried out on the deck of a US aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson. The body, shrouded in a white sheet and placed in a weighted bag, was then positioned on a flat board, tipped up, and eased into the Arabian Sea. This occurred at 0600GMT, approximately 12 hours after the firefight during which Osama Bin Laden was shot in the head. After this first shot, reports ABC News' The Blotter, he was shot again, to make sure that he was dead. The body was then flown to Afghanistan and Bin Laden's identity was confirmed. Officials say a DNA sample was taken that matched that of several other family members. Some sources say facial recognition technology was also used. From Afghanistan, the body was, it appears, flown to the USS Carl Vinson. \"A military officer read prepared religious remarks, which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker,\" a US defence official said. According to UK-based Imam Dr Abduljalil Sajid, Chairman of the Muslim Council for Religious Racial Harmony, four key steps need to be followed: There is no necessity for an imam to be present, he says, but the procedures should be carried out by Muslims at least one of whom \"knows the minimum basic Muslim law of burial.\" Whether any such person was present is impossible to know, he says, based on the limited information provided. But he also questions whether sea burial was appropriate in this case. It is correct to carry out a burial at sea when someone dies on a sea journey, he says, but in this case there was no sound reason for it. The US authorities could surely have found someone - a member of the extensive Bin Laden family, or even one of the many supporters of his \"evil\" ideology - who would have been prepared to give the body a proper burial, he argues. His words were echoed by Mohammed Qudah, a professor of Islamic law at the University of Jordan, who told the Associated Press news agency that burying Bin Laden at sea was not forbidden if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial. But he went on: \"It's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive Bin Laden's body.\" The agency also quoted Dubai's grand mufti Mohammed al-Qubaisi, saying that sea burials were permissible only in extraordinary circumstances, adding: \"This is not one of them.\" \"If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: You dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it,\" he said. US officials have given two reasons why a sea burial was chosen. First, that they did not want his grave to become a shrine. Second, that there was no time to negotiate with other countries to arrange a possible burial on land. According to CBS News, Saudi Arabia refused to take the body. If correct, this suggests that an offer was made - and that had Saudi Arabia accepted the body, there would have been a grave, which could in theory have become a shrine. However, ABC's Jonathan Karl, writing before the burial was confirmed, painted a different picture: \"US officials tell me the last thing they want is for his burial place to become a terrorist shrine. \"To avoid that, an informed source tells me, the intention is to bury his body at sea - leaving no definitive location for the final resting place of his body.\"", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "Islamic tradition requires the dead to be buried as soon as possible, unless an autopsy is required.

The families, who say the men were \"massacred,\" had their case rejected by the UK Court of Appeal last year. British forces at the time of the killings said the men were insurgents. In the Supreme Court panel's judgement, one of the justices, Lord Kerr, described the case as \"shocking\" and said the \"overwhelming preponderance of currently available evidence\" showed \"wholly innocent men were mercilessly murdered.\" He said it was \"with regret\" that he dismissed the appeal. \"This is an instance where the law has proved itself unable to respond positively to the demand that there be redress for the historical wrong that the appellants so passionately believe has been perpetrated on them and their relatives,\" Lord Kerr said. \"That may reflect a deficiency in our system of law. It certainly does not represent any discredit on the honourable crusade that the appellants have pursued.\" Another of the justices, Lady Hale, said she would have allowed the appeal and said the UK government \"did not seriously consider the most cost-effective form which such an inquiry might take.\" \"They did not seriously consider the \"bigger picture\": the public interest in properly inquiring into an event of this magnitude; the private interests of the relatives and survivors in knowing the truth and seeing the reputations of their deceased relatives vindicated,\" she said.

It was argued on behalf of the government that the Human Rights Act \"does not have retrospective effect and does not impose an obligation to hold an inquiry into deaths occurring several decades before it came into force.\" The account of the British authorities at the time was that the deceased were justifiably shot while they were attempting to escape from the patrol.

They are six points off the Premier League summit after losing two consecutive home league matches for the first time since December 2008, and have lost ground to Arsenal and Tottenham, who are in third and second respectively. City know the gap is not insurmountable, having been eight points behind Manchester United in April 2012 before snatching the Premier League title on the final day. But they are 11 points worse off than Leicester and Tottenham during this 17-game period and need to find form quickly. City will point towards the penalty as a key moment against a Tottenham side who have not won a top-flight title since 1961.

{"original_text": "The hosts saw left-back Alex Telles dismissed after two bookings in a 74-second spell, the second after a wild sliding tackle on Stephan Lichtsteiner on 27 minutes.

But Juve - who had 77 possession - broke through when Pjaca drove low into the net five minutes after coming on and Alves finished from six yards 80 seconds after his own introduction.

Retallack, a family friend, wanted to help Bianco fulfill her dream of visiting Paris before she died. The court heard that Retallack had paid for Bianco's transportation, accommodation and expenses for the trip. Unfortunately, Bianco did not die within the expected time frame and this led to a legal dispute between Retallack and Bianco's mother, who claimed that Retallack had taken advantage of Bianco's illness to control her finances. The case went to court and the judge ruled in favor of Retallack, stating that there was no evidence to support the mother's allegations.

The trio all appeared at Belfast Crown Court. The charges arose from incidents in 2013. The court hearing was told that on 9 October, 2013, a car driven by Gavin Hughes was stopped in north Belfast, and when the vehicle was stopped a black plastic bag was located on the passenger seat. The bag contained five compact cubes of cocaine which amounted to 1.27 kilos of the Class A drug. When Gavin Hughes was searched, another amount of cocaine was found in the pockets of his jeans, and he was taken into custody. The following day, officers travelled to an address in the Ligoniel area of the city, which at the time was being rented by Gavin Hughes.

Both the property and a vehicle parked outside the house were searched, and further packages of cocaine were seized, alongside items and equipment associated with mixing drugs. Also located during the search were 21 ecstasy tablets. The court heard it was the Crown's case that the rented property was being used to mix the cocaine and prepare it for sale. The total amount of cocaine seized on 9 and 10 October 2013 amounted to 3.25 kilos. The Hughes brothers subsequently pleaded guilty to a number of drugs offences, while Gerard Hughes also admitted two further offences - namely possession of cannabis with intent to supply, and possession of amphetamine on 6 August, 2013. These offences were linked to the seizure of drugs in a car park in east Belfast.

{"original_text": "Dubbed \"carbon farming,\" researchers say the idea is economically competitive with high-tech carbon capture and storage projects. But critics say the idea could be have unforeseen, negative impacts including driving up food prices. The research has been published in the journal Earth System Dynamics. Jatropha curcas is a plant that originated in Central America and is very well adapted to harsh conditions including extremely arid deserts. It is already grown as a biofuel in some parts of the world because its seeds can produce oil. In this study, German scientists showed that one hectare of jatropha could capture up to 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. The researchers based their estimates on trees currently growing in trial plots in Egypt and in the Negev desert. \"The results are overwhelming,\" said Prof Klaus Becker, from the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart. \"There was good growth, a good response from these plants. I feel there will be no problem trying it on a much larger scale, for example ten thousand hectares in the beginning,\" he said. According to the researchers a plantation that would cover three percent of the Arabian desert would absorb all the CO2 produced by cars and trucks in Germany over a 20 year period. The scientists say that a critical element of the plan would be the availability of desalination facilities. This means that initially, any plantations would be confined to coastal areas. They are hoping to develop larger trials in desert areas of Oman or Qatar. Prof Becker says that unlike other schemes that just offset the carbon that people produce, the planting of jatropha could be a good, short term solution to climate change. \"I think it is a good idea because we are really extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - and it is completely different between extracting and preventing.\" According to the scientist's calculations the costs of curbing carbon dioxide via the planting of trees would be between 42 and 63 euros per tonne. This makes it competitive with other techniques, such as the more high tech carbon capture and storage (CCS). A number of countries are currently trialling this technology but it has yet to be deployed commercially. Growing jatropha not only soaks up CO2 but has other benefits. The plants would help to make desert areas more habitable, and the plant's seeds can be harvested for biofuel say the researchers, providing an economic return. \"Jatropha is ideal to be turned into biokerosene - it is even better than biodiesel,\" said Prof Becker. But other experts in this area are not convinced. They point to the fact that in 2007 and 2008 large numbers of jatropha trees were planted for biofuel, especially in Africa. But many of these ventures ended in tears, as the plants were not very successful in coping with dry conditions. Lucy Hurn is the biofuels campaign manager for the charity, Actionaid. She says that while jatropha was once seen as the great, green hope the reality was very different. \"When jatropha was introduced it was seen as a miracle crop, it would grow on scrubland or marginal land,\" she said. \"But there are often people who need marginal land to graze their animals, they are getting food from that area - we wouldn't class the land as marginal.\" She pointed out that jatropha is highly toxic and can pollute the land it is grown on, even in a desert. And she also had concerns about the fairness of the idea. \"It is still somebody else's land.

The choreography was over-reliant on hand gestures; and Spears showed a tendency to slip in and out of time, like a clockwork doll whose mechanism had worn out. Her biggest blunder came during the song Touch of My Hand, as she leant over a dancer's arm to initiate a backflip, but teetered on her heels and aborted the move. Frustratingly, Spears showed glimpses of her former glories - pulling off a series of impressive lifts, as well as a punchy dance breakdown during Womanizer - but the routines more often felt like they were stuck in the rehearsal room.

In the end, Spears has always played second fiddle to her songs - especially in the second half of her career, following a much-documented breakdown in 2007 that means her life is still controlled by a court-approved conservatorship - and those songs provided an unshakeable foundation to her act.

{"original_text": "Philae, the first spacecraft to land on a comet, was dropped on to the surface of Comet 67P by its mothership, Rosetta, last November. It worked for 60 hours before its solar-powered battery ran flat. The comet has since moved nearer to the Sun and Philae has enough power to work again, says the BBC's science correspondent Jonathan Amos. An account linked to the probe tweeted the message, \"Hello Earth! Can you hear me?\" On its blog, Esa said Philae had contacted Earth, via Rosetta, for 85 seconds on Saturday in the first contact since going into hibernation in November. \"Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35C and has 24 watts available,\" said Philae project manager, Dr Stephan Ulamec. Scientists say they now waiting for the next contact. Esa's senior scientific advisor, Prof Mark McCaughrean, told the BBC: \"It's been a long seven months, and to be quite honest we weren't sure it would happen - there are a lot of very happy people around Europe at the moment.\" Philae was carrying large amounts of data that scientists hoped to download once it made contact again, he said. \"I think we're optimistic now that it's awake that we'll have several months of scientific data to pore over,\" he added. This is one of the most astonishing moments in space exploration and the grins on the faces of the scientists and engineers are totally justified, says BBC science editor David Shukman. For the first time, we will have a hitchhiker riding on a comet and describing what happens to a comet as it heats up on its journey through space, he adds. Philae is designed to analyse the ice and rocky fragments that make up the comet. Prof Monica Grady from the Open University told the BBC that scientists now hoped to be able to carry out experiments to see whether comets were the source of life on Earth. Comets contained a lot of water and carbon, and \"these are the same sorts of molecules responsible for getting life going,\" she said. \"What we're trying to find out is whether the building blocks of life, in terms of water and carbon-bearing molecules, were actually delivered to Earth from comets.\" When Philae first sent back images of its landing location, researchers could see it was in a dark ditch. The Sun was obscured by a high wall, limiting the amount of light that could reach the robot's solar panels. Scientists knew they only had a limited amount of time - about 60 hours - to gather data before the robot's battery ran flat. But the calculations also indicated that Philae's mission might not be over for good when the juice did eventually run dry. The comet is currently moving in towards the Sun, and the intensity of light falling on Philae, engineers suggested, could be sufficient in time to re-boot the machine. And so it has proved. Scientists must now hope they can get enough power into Philae to carry out a full range of experiments. One ambition not fulfilled before the robot went to sleep was to try to drill into the comet, to examine its chemical make-up. One attempt was made last year, and it failed. A second attempt will now become a priority. Return of the plucky robot Philae's extraordinary opportunity Rosetta: The whole story The Rosetta probe took 10 years to reach 67P, and the lander - about the size of a washing-machine - bounced at least a kilometre when it touched down. Before it lost power, Philae sent back images of its surroundings that showed it was in a dark location with high walls blocking sunlight from reaching its solar panels.

Esa had a good idea of where it was likely to be, down to a few tens of metres, but could not get Rosetta close enough to the comet to acquire conclusive pictures. Continued radio contact should now allow precise coordinates to be determined, correspondents say. Comet 67P is currently 205 million km (127 million miles) from the Sun, and getting closer. It is due in August to get as close as 186 million km, before then sweeping back out into the outer Solar System. As it nears the sun, the comet will warm and its ices will melt. This process will throw out a huge shroud of gas and dust, and if Philae can continue to keep working it will provide scientists with an extraordinary view of what is happening right at the surface of 67P.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "Philae, the first spacecraft to land on a comet, was dropped on to the surface of Comet 67P by its mothership, Rosetta, last November. It worked for 60 hours before its solar-powered battery ran flat. The comet has since moved nearer to the Sun and Philae has enough power to work again, says the BBC's science correspondent Jonathan Amos. An account linked to the probe tweeted the message, \"Hello Earth! Can you hear me?\" On its blog, Esa said Philae had contacted Earth, via Rosetta, for 85 seconds on Saturday in the first contact since going into hibernation in November. \"Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35C and has 24 watts available,\" said Philae project manager, Dr Stephan Ulamec. Scientists say they now waiting for the next contact. Esa's senior scientific advisor, Prof Mark McCaughrean, told the BBC: \"It's been a long seven months, and to be quite honest we weren't sure it would happen - there are a lot of very happy people around Europe at the moment.\" Philae was carrying large amounts of data that scientists hoped to download once it made contact again, he said. \"I think we're optimistic now that it's awake that we'll have several months of scientific data to pore over,\" he added. This is one of the most astonishing moments in space exploration and the grins on the faces of the scientists and engineers are totally justified, says BBC science editor David Shukman. For the first time, we will have a hitchhiker riding on a comet and describing what happens to a comet as it heats up on its journey through space, he adds. Philae is designed to analyse the ice and rocky fragments that make up the comet. Prof Monica Grady from the Open University told the BBC that scientists now hoped to be able to carry out experiments to see whether comets were the source of life on Earth. Comets contained a lot of water and carbon, and \"these are the same sorts of molecules responsible for getting life going,\" she said. \"What we're trying to find out is whether the building blocks of life, in terms of water and carbon-bearing molecules, were actually delivered to Earth from comets.\" When Philae first sent back images of its landing location, researchers could see it was in a dark ditch. The Sun was obscured by a high wall, limiting the amount of light that could reach the robot's solar panels. Scientists knew they only had a limited amount of time - about 60 hours - to gather data before the robot's battery ran flat. But the calculations also indicated that Philae's mission might not be over for good when the juice did eventually run dry. The comet is currently moving in towards the Sun, and the intensity of light falling on Philae, engineers suggested, could be sufficient in time to re-boot the machine. And so it has proved. Scientists must now hope they can get enough power into Philae to carry out a full range of experiments. One ambition not fulfilled before the robot went to sleep was to try to drill into the comet, to examine its chemical make-up. One attempt was made last year, and it failed. A second attempt will now become a priority. Return of the plucky robot Philae's extraordinary opportunity Rosetta: The whole story The Rosetta probe took 10 years to reach 67P, and the lander - about the size of a washing-machine - bounced at least a kilometre when it touched down. Before it lost power, Philae sent back images of its surroundings that showed it was in a dark location with high walls blocking sunlight from reaching its solar panels. Its exact location on the duck-shaped comet has since been a mystery. Esa had a good idea of where it was likely to be, down to a few tens of metres, but could not get Rosetta close enough to the comet to acquire conclusive pictures.

For example, researchers can use this technology to pinpoint which brain regions are most affected in a patient with Alzheimer's and track the progression of the disease over time. Similarly, they can use it to test the effectiveness of new drugs that are designed to slow or halt the disease progression by measuring the rate of neuronal degeneration in those brain regions.

The survey found more than 60 of Scottish firms believe Brexit would have a \"negative impact\" on them. However, the institute said there was little evidence of companies cancelling investment or recruitment outright. The Fraser of Allander Institute, an independent research body based at the University of Strathclyde, carried out the survey between 5 July and 12 July, in the aftermath of the EU referendum. Just over 60 of Scottish firms surveyed said they believed Brexit will have a negative impact on their business, while only 19 said it would have a positive impact. One third said the impact would be \"very negative.\" About 40 believe that leaving the EU could lead to a decrease in their investment and expansion plans, and 34 said that they could cut back on recruitment. More than 70 of firms surveyed as part of the research had done no preparation for the UK exiting the EU. Two-thirds of businesses said resolution of the uncertainty in the economy was a key issue in the negotiation of the UK's exit from the European Union, while 49 of firms cited access to the single market as a key issue. However, the survey found little evidence of companies actually cancelling investment or recruitment plans. A quarter of firms said they had made a decision to change their investment and recruitment plans, though the vast majority - 95 - said that decisions had been postponed rather than cancelled entirely.

He rose to fame by beating Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon but has been involved in a number of controversies, such as making remarks about Stan Wawrinka's girlfriend during a match last year, resulting in a suspended 28-day ban from the Association of Tour Professionals. \"He doesn't understand what it takes to be someone who wins Grand Slams at this level and that is unfortunate,\" McEnroe added.

Compatriot Pat Cash described Kyrgios as a \"different sort of kid\" but also said he is \"definitely talented.\" Cash, the 1987 Wimbledon champion, added: \"I think that is what frustrates a lot of Australians.

Compatriot Pat Cash described Kyrgios as a \"different sort of kid\" but also said he is \"definitely talented.\" Cash, the 1987 Wimbledon champion, added: \"I think that is what frustrates a lot of Australians. To see that much talent, you want it to be utilised better. \"I just don't think he is that type of kid. He is getting better. He is doing his best to not get in as much trouble this year, though he still has a few fines. \"Nick says he doesn't really love tennis and I understand that. I didn't love tennis, I was just good at it. Andre Agassi said the same thing.\""}

DNA analysis has revealed that the indigenous hunter-gatherer population, also known as Western Hunter-Gatherers, contributed about 50-70 of the DNA of modern-day Europeans. The Middle Eastern farmers, who migrated during the Neolithic Revolution around 8,000 years ago, contributed around 20-30 of the DNA. The third ancestral population, known as the Steppe invaders, arrived during the Bronze Age around 4,000-5,000 years ago and contributed around 5-15 of the DNA of modern-day Europeans. These three ancestral populations interbred over time, eventually forming the diverse genetic makeup of modern-day Europeans.

McGregor, 28, danced around the stage as he criticised 40-year-old Mayweather and his promoters. The pair will meet over 12 rounds under boxing rules on 26 August. In a series of expletive-laden outbursts, mixed martial arts star McGregor insulted Mayweather over his outfit and even suggested he couldn't read. \"How do I look?\" McGregor asked the crowd, before pointing at Mayweather's bag. \"He's 40! Dress your age, carrying a school bag on stage. \"What are you doing with a school bag on stage? You can't even read.\" Mayweather, dressed in a T-shirt and cap while McGregor wore a suit, replied: \"I'm the one that can't read? I do numbers, I make money,\" \"You owe money,\" McGregor responded, referring to reports that Mayweather asked the IRS earlier this month for more time to pay his 2015 tax bill. Undefeated Mayweather took an Irish flag from the crowd and paraded it in front of McGregor, before the Irishman threw it back in the boxer's face. Their head-to-head meeting was the second in a four-day international tour to four cities to promote the bout taking place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

Kavanagh said: \"We have gone through one training cycle and we had some good sparring partners in - and, as we expected, his skills transcended. \"He is not trying to win Wimbledon.

{"original_text": "He wanted a tribunal to approve a move to a Scottish prison, but Ashworth Hospital said he had chronic mental illness and needed continued care at the Merseyside top-security facility. Brady, now 75, and Myra Hindley, who died in prison in 2002, tortured and murdered five children. He was jailed for three murders in 1966 and has been at Ashworth since 1985. He and Hindley later confessed to another two murders. Judge Robert Atherton, who headed the three-person mental health tribunal at Ashworth, said: \"The tribunal has concluded that Mr Ian Stewart Brady continues to suffer from a mental disorder which is of a nature and degree which makes it appropriate for him to continue to receive medical treatment, and that it is necessary for his health and safety and for the protection of other persons that he should receive such treatment in hospital, and that appropriate medical treatment is available for him.\" The reasons for the tribunal's decision will be released later. By Dominic CascianiHome affairs correspondent Ashworth Hospital argued that Brady was after \"a win\" over the authorities. This decision, which denies him that victory, comes down to the very narrow legal remit that had to be fulfilled by his mental health tribunal. The panel had one simple duty: to assess the patient's health and what would be clinically right for him. So although we have not yet seen the full reasons, the tribunal's decision means it has decided that Brady is still suffering from paranoid schizophrenia or another treatable disorder. Once it had come to that conclusion, it could further rule that it would be appropriate to keep Brady at Ashworth, either to receive treatment or because it would be necessary for his own safety or those of others. It's going to be very difficult for him to challenge the decision because he can only launch an appeal if he can show that the tribunal got the law wrong. Brady has the right to challenge the decision. Dr David Fearnley, medical director at Ashworth, said: \"We appreciate the time and effort the mental health tribunal has given to this case and its judgment is consistent with the expert opinions of our clinicians. \"Mr Brady suffers from a severe personality disorder and a mental illness which still require high-quality care. \"It is a testament to the staff of Ashworth Hospital that we have been able to stabilise his schizophrenia to the degree we have. However, his condition is chronic and will require this support for the foreseeable future.\" Asked if the tribunal, which was held in public at Brady's request, may have exacerbated the illness, Dr Fearnley said: \"I think the difficulty with an individual such as Ian Brady is that he has a complex mental disorder and for many years has been able to publicise his concerns. \"However, we see this as part of an overall problem which our experts are looking into and will continue to provide expert care.\" Brady has been on a hunger strike since 1999, and appeared at the tribunal with his feeding tube in place. The tribunal heard that he also eats some food on \"most days.\" Dr Fearnley said his treatment was under review by the specialist team, including the issue of feeding. Brady and Hindley's crimes of sexual abuse, torture and murder of children shocked the nation. Lesley Ann Downey, 10, John Kilbride, 12, Keith Bennett, 12, and Pauline Reade, 16, were all sexually assaulted before their deaths at the hands of the couple. Their bodies were buried on Saddleworth Moor, near Manchester, although Keith Bennett's body was never found. Their final victim, Edward Evans, 17, was murdered in front of Hindley's 17-year-old brother-in-law, who alerted the police. Keith's mother, Winnie Johnson, made repeated calls for Brady to reveal the location of his grave. She died last year, aged 78, without knowing where her son's remains are. Her solicitor John Ainley said he thought she would have been \"satisfied\" by the tribunal's decision. \"She always felt that Ian Brady did not give the children any choice and consequently he should not have the choice to leave the hospital environment.\" Terry Kilbride, the brother of John, said Brady should stay in hospital. \"I don't believe he's going to kill himself, that's just a ploy, just another wind-up. \"I think to be honest he should go back to hospital, I think that's where he belongs, in the hospital, and keep him alive as long as possible because it's only him that knows where Keith Bennett is.\" Brady gave evidence for more than four hours at the tribunal, which sat at Ashworth psychiatric hospital in Maghull. It was the first time he had spoken in public for 47 years. Brady had told the tribunal he used \"method acting\" to trick doctors into classing him as insane so he could be transferred from prison to hospital. But he said he now wanted to leave Ashworth because he hated it and \"the regime has changed to a penal warehouse.\" The tribunal heard from Brady's lawyer that Brady had a severe personality disorder but was not mentally ill and could be treated in prison rather than hospital.

In November, the Equality and Human Rights Commission said that, overall, black people were six times more likely than white people to be stopped, with Asian or other ethnic minority groups two times more likely to be stopped.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"Instead of internal rows over this, Theresa May should accept our offer to work together to change stop and search.\" The prime minister's former adviser on youth and crime, Shaun Bailey, said: \"Not getting stop and search right, certainly in urban communities, would be very dangerous because I believe it breeds criminals. \"If I was talking to someone in government I'd say:'Take the brave pill, you'll be rewarded for taking the brave pill and reforming stop and search'.\" He added: \"There's many communities up and down the country who are divorced from politics and feel that the forces-that-be don't represent them and don't care about them.

Backed by domestic abuse charities SafeLives and Respect, it will be piloted in Essex, Sussex and South Wales. But domestic violence charity Refuge said there was \"no evidence\" therapy for violent partners was effective. Rachel Williams from Newport, who suffered 18 years of domestic violence at the hands of her late husband, Darren Williams, said: \"If you don't deal with the perpetrator, who's the problem, all they'll do is go on to the next victim.\" In 2011, after Ms Williams filed for divorce, her husband burst into her hair salon armed with a sawn-off shotgun and shot her in the leg, before hanging himself in woodland. Six weeks later, as she was recovering in hospital, the body of her 16-year-old son, Jack, was found hanged in the same spot. Ms Williams, 44, who has since remarried, said her former husband would have benefited from the scheme. \"He was a control freak and he needed his actions addressing,\" she said. \"We've got to try and change the mindset of the perpetrator and hold them accountable for their actions.\" One woman who survived a \"hellish five-year marriage to a physically, emotionally and financially abusive man\" said she did not believe the Drive scheme would be effective and it would be better to spend the money on support for victims. \"The majority - although not all - of serial perpetrators of domestic violence do it out of choice, not because they have drug, alcohol, social or financial problems,\" she said. \"They will use this Drive scheme as a way to avoid prison and they will deliberately make it look as though they are reforming until they are'signed off' and deemed safe. \"They will then simply find another victim and go back to how they were.\" Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said there was \"no evidence - here or abroad - that therapy programmes for violent partners work.\" She added: \"On the face of it, it seems like a worthy thing to do. In an ideal world we would approach this from both sides. But we don't live in an ideal world. \"We live in a world were thousands and thousands of women and children are being terrorised and brutalised in their homes and they have nowhere to go. And sadly, finding a refuge space in this country is like finding gold dust.\" Although there are already a number of schemes for perpetrators of domestic violence, the Drive project is intended to be different. It is aimed at dangerous offenders, including those thought to be at risk of causing serious harm or committing murder. Unlike most existing schemes, which involve group work or family therapy, offenders on the Drive programme will be given bespoke one-to-one sessions. They will be offered support to tackle any alcohol, drug or mental health problems they may have. Advice about employment, housing and parenting will also be available. Those who refuse to co-operate will be monitored closely by police; civil court orders and criminal sanctions will be considered to disrupt their offending behaviour. Diana Barran, chief executive officer of SafeLives, said: \"Despite significant improvements for victim safety in the UK there are still 100,000 women who live with high-risk domestic abuse at any one time. \"If you do not hold perpetrators to account, we will continue to see the statistics at a standstill. \"Focusing on crisis management is of course vital but we want to help victims today and reduce the number of victims of tomorrow - and we can only do this by getting to the root and the cause of the problem - the perpetrator.\" It is expected that 900 offenders will be asked to take part in the scheme over the next three years.

But we don't live in an ideal world. \"We live in a world were thousands and thousands of women and children are being terrorised and brutalised in their homes and they have nowhere to go. And sadly, finding a refuge space in this country is like finding gold dust.\" Although there are already a number of schemes for perpetrators of domestic violence, the Drive project is intended to be different. It is aimed at dangerous offenders, including those thought to be at risk of causing serious harm or committing murder. Unlike most existing schemes, which involve group work or family therapy, offenders on the Drive programme will be given bespoke one-to-one sessions. They will be offered support to tackle any alcohol, drug or mental health problems they may have. Advice about employment, housing and parenting will also be available. Those who refuse to co-operate will be monitored closely by police; civil court orders and criminal sanctions will be considered to disrupt their offending behaviour. Diana Barran, chief executive officer of SafeLives, said: \"Despite significant improvements for victim safety in the UK there are still 100,000 women who live with high-risk domestic abuse at any one time. \"If you do not hold perpetrators to account, we will continue to see the statistics at a standstill. \"Focusing on crisis management is of course vital but we want to help victims today and reduce the number of victims of tomorrow - and we can only do this by getting to the root and the cause of the problem - the perpetrator.\" It is expected that 900 offenders will be asked to take part in the scheme over the next three years. It also has support from Social Finance, a not-for-profit organisation, and is funded by police and crime commissioners in the three areas, as well as the Lloyds Bank Foundation for England and Wales and the Tudor Trust."}

{"original_text": "Ackerman was initially banned in October last year after being found guilty of corruption. He had laid bets against a horse knowing its jockey aimed not to win. Ackerman was charged with breaching racing rules and bringing racing into disrepute, and was subsequently handed a 10-year ban from all involvement in horse racing. The case against Ackerman was initiated after an investigation by the independent regulator for horseracing, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA). The BHA found that Ackerman had placed a lay bet on the horse 'Jolly Jumper' in a race at Lingfield in January 2019. His bet was successful, as the horse finished in fifth place out of six runners. However, the BHA found that Ackerman had inside information about the race. He knew that the jockey of 'Jolly Jumper', Philip Evans, had been instructed not to win by the horse's trainer, Joe Bloggs. This meant that Ackerman's bet was effectively a guaranteed win. The BHA took a dim view of Ackerman's actions, and viewed them as being \"pre-meditated, manipulative and harmful to racing.\" It also noted that such conduct had the potential to erode public trust in racing. Ackerman's ban also applies to him from entering any racecourse, training yard, or stables, and from owning or being involved in any way with any horses in training or racing. He has also been ordered to pay 4,000 towards the BHA's costs in bringing the case against him.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Former jockey Gary Ackerman has been banned from all involvement in horse racing for 10 years, after being found guilty of betting on a race he knew had been fixed."}

{"original_text": "Negotiations over who will run the PS200m Metrobus network have stalled as bus companies are reluctant to run the service on a completely commercial basis. Metrobus admits public subsidies might now have to be used to entice firms on board. The first of the new bus routes are due to be completed in the next few months. David Redgewell, from passenger group Bus Users UK, said the lack of a current operator was a worry. \"We need to be realistic about what the bus industry can deliver in hard times,\" he said. \"The buses have to make money, so there's really going to have to be realism amongst the public authorities that unless they are prepared to put public subsidy in then they [buses] need to be commercial.\" In March 2015, Bristol City Council was required to spend more than PS1m removing protestors from Stapleton allotments, part of the new Metrobus route. Former secretary of Stapleton Allotments Association, Jane Ghosh, said she was \"absolutely shocked but not the least bit surprised.\" \"It's cost PS200 million plus, it's a lot more than that because of the delays. They only have PS34 million from the government, which is static and won't go up,\" she said. \"We told them right at the beginning, this was never going to be a commercially viable project - but nobody listened to us.\" BBC Radio Bristol politics reporter Pete Simson Could Bristol really be left with a brand new public transport network, but no company willing to run it? The idea was always for Metrobus to be run without subsidies, using shiny new buses with clean fuel. Unfortunately, it would appear bus companies view this as simply too risky, after all, they want to make a profit. With huge swathes of Bristol's roads currently being dug up to build Metrobus, the need for a deal becomes ever more pressing. Time will tell if this is merely another teething problem, or a hugely costly mistake. Commuters are currently enduring roadworks associated with the scheme in the city centre, on the M32 and various other locations in South Gloucestershire. The scheme was devised by the West of England Partnership (WEP), an alliance between the four councils in Bristol, Bath, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset. It involves three routes: Ashton Vale to Temple Meads, Cribbs Causeway via Emersons Green to the city centre and the South Bristol link between the A370 Long Ashton bypass and Hengrove Park. It will provide an express bus service on 31 miles (50km) of segregated bus-ways and bus lanes. The WEP said Bristol, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset council were \"actively negotiating\" with bus operators and such discussions were commercially sensitive. A spokeswoman said: \"We have always been clear that the aim is that the MetroBus services are run entirely on a commercial basis via a quality partnership scheme that sets minimum standards for frequencies, quality of vehicles and maximum fares, supported by a voluntary partnership agreement with one or more operator. \"Of course should negotiations not be successful, we have a range of back up plans which could include formal contracts to run all or some services on a contracted basis. \"This might require the use of public money following a competitive procurement process, but this would depend on the situation when negotiations conclude - which all parties agree should be in about three-four weeks' time.\" First Bus, Wessex and the Bath Bus Company RAPT were said to be in the running for the contract.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "Negotiations over who will run the PS200m Metrobus network have stalled as bus companies are reluctant to run the service on a completely commercial basis.

David Redgewell, from passenger group Bus Users UK, said the lack of a current operator was a worry. \"We need to be realistic about what the bus industry can deliver in hard times,\" he said. \"The buses have to make money, so there's really going to have to be realism amongst the public authorities that unless they are prepared to put public subsidy in then they [buses] need to be commercial.\" In March 2015, Bristol City Council was required to spend more than PS1m removing protestors from Stapleton allotments, part of the new Metrobus route. Former secretary of Stapleton Allotments Association, Jane Ghosh, said she was \"absolutely shocked but not the least bit surprised.\" \"It's cost PS200 million plus, it's a lot more than that because of the delays. They only have PS34 million from the government, which is static and won't go up,\" she said. \"We told them right at the beginning, this was never going to be a commercially viable project - but nobody listened to us.\" BBC Radio Bristol politics reporter Pete Simson Could Bristol really be left with a brand new public transport network, but no company willing to run it? The idea was always for Metrobus to be run without subsidies, using shiny new buses with clean fuel. Unfortunately, it would appear bus companies view this as simply too risky, after all, they want to make a profit. With huge swathes of Bristol's roads currently being dug up to build Metrobus, the need for a deal becomes ever more pressing. Time will tell if this is merely another teething problem, or a hugely costly mistake. Commuters are currently enduring roadworks associated with the scheme in the city centre, on the M32 and various other locations in South Gloucestershire. The scheme was devised by the West of England Partnership (WEP), an alliance between the four councils in Bristol, Bath, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset. It involves three routes: Ashton Vale to Temple Meads, Cribbs Causeway via Emersons Green to the city centre and the South Bristol link between the A370 Long Ashton bypass and Hengrove Park. It will provide an express bus service on 31 miles (50km) of segregated bus-ways and bus lanes. The WEP said Bristol, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset council were \"actively negotiating\" with bus operators and such discussions were commercially sensitive. A spokeswoman said: \"We have always been clear that the aim is that the MetroBus services are run entirely on a commercial basis via a quality partnership scheme that sets minimum standards for frequencies, quality of vehicles and maximum fares, supported by a voluntary partnership agreement with one or more operator. \"Of course should negotiations not be successful, we have a range of back up plans which could include formal contracts to run all or some services on a contracted basis. \"This might require the use of public money following a competitive procurement process, but this would depend on the situation when negotiations conclude - which all parties agree should be in about three-four weeks' time.\" First Bus, Wessex and the Bath Bus Company RAPT were said to be in the running for the contract."}

He was one of the most colourful characters in the British game and has since enjoyed success at Inter Milan and Real Madrid before returning to London. BBC Sport looks at some of Mourinho's best quotes and controversies. On becoming Chelsea manager for the first time: \"I have top players and I'm sorry, we have a top manager. Please do not call me arrogant because what I say is true. I'm European champion, I'm not one out of the bottle, I think I'm a special one.\" On bird flu: \"I'm feeling a lot of pressure with the swan in Scotland. It's not far and I'm more scared of the swan than of football. What's football compared to life? A swan with bird flu, for me that's a drama.\" On drinking wine with then-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: \"After the game, after the press conference, we were together in my office. The wine we were drinking was very bad and he was complaining. When we go to Old Trafford it's my birthday and I will go with a beautiful bottle of Portuguese wine.\" Media playback is not supported on this device On eggs: \"Omelettes, eggs. No eggs, no omelettes. And it depends on the quality of the eggs in the supermarket. They are class one, two or three and some are more expensive than others and some give you better omelettes. When the class one eggs are not available you have a problem.\" On being sacked: \"If the club decide to sack me because of bad results that's part of the game. If it happens I will be a millionaire and get another club a couple of months later.\" On Chelsea's pitch: \"Sometimes you see beautiful people with no brains. Sometimes you have ugly people who are intelligent, like scientists. Our pitch is a bit like that. From the top it's a disgrace but the ball rolls at normal speed.\" On playing Chelsea, while manager of Real Madrid: \"If I play them in the Champions League, I want to go there and kill them - that's my message,\" Then-Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez: \"If Chelsea are naive and pure then I'm Little Red Riding Hood.\" Then-Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock: \"My wife will be glad about Mourinho coming to Bramall Lane because he's a good looking swine, isn't he?\" Career record up to 1 June 2013 Former Chelsea striker Eidur Gudjohnsen: \"When Mourinho says training will last one-and-a-half hours it will never last a second longer.\" Then-Chelsea striker Didier Drogba's reaction to Mourinho leaving the London club: \"I find Jose's'eviction' hard to take. I could not see the blow coming so brutally. \"It changes an awful lot of things. I am in the sort of nervous state I've never dreamed about before. Many of us used to play first and foremost for the manager. Now we need to forget those feelings and find another source of motivation.\" Ian Holloway on Mourinho's sacking by Chelsea: \"Football has gone mad. He is one of the best managers in the world. I'm devastated. I was learning from him from afar. He makes you feel 25-foot tall and I'm going to sorely miss him.\" Barcelona vice-president Carles Vilarrubi on Mourinho's return to Chelsea: \"It is not good for English football. If Mourinho behaves like he did in Spain it will only be an unhappy relationship. In his three years in Spain he only created disagreements and arguments.

He was one of the most colourful characters in the British game and has since enjoyed success at Inter Milan and Real Madrid before returning to London. BBC Sport looks at some of Mourinho's best quotes and controversies. On becoming Chelsea manager for the first time: \"I have top players and I'm sorry, we have a top manager. Please do not call me arrogant because what I say is true. I'm European champion, I'm not one out of the bottle, I think I'm a special one.\" On bird flu: \"I'm feeling a lot of pressure with the swan in Scotland. It's not far and I'm more scared of the swan than of football. What's football compared to life? A swan with bird flu, for me that's a drama.\" On drinking wine with then-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: \"After the game, after the press conference, we were together in my office. The wine we were drinking was very bad and he was complaining. When we go to Old Trafford it's my birthday and I will go with a beautiful bottle of Portuguese wine.\" Media playback is not supported on this device On eggs: \"Omelettes, eggs. No eggs, no omelettes. And it depends on the quality of the eggs in the supermarket. They are class one, two or three and some are more expensive than others and some give you better omelettes. When the class one eggs are not available you have a problem.\" On being sacked: \"If the club decide to sack me because of bad results that's part of the game. If it happens I will be a millionaire and get another club a couple of months later.\" On Chelsea's pitch: \"Sometimes you see beautiful people with no brains. Sometimes you have ugly people who are intelligent, like scientists. Our pitch is a bit like that. From the top it's a disgrace but the ball rolls at normal speed.\" On playing Chelsea, while manager of Real Madrid: \"If I play them in the Champions League, I want to go there and kill them - that's my message,\" Then-Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez: \"If Chelsea are naive and pure then I'm Little Red Riding Hood.\" Then-Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock: \"My wife will be glad about Mourinho coming to Bramall Lane because he's a good looking swine, isn't he?\" Career record up to 1 June 2013 Former Chelsea striker Eidur Gudjohnsen: \"When Mourinho says training will last one-and-a-half hours it will never last a second longer.\" Then-Chelsea striker Didier Drogba's reaction to Mourinho leaving the London club: \"I find Jose's'eviction' hard to take. I could not see the blow coming so brutally. \"It changes an awful lot of things. I am in the sort of nervous state I've never dreamed about before. Many of us used to play first and foremost for the manager. Now we need to forget those feelings and find another source of motivation.\" Ian Holloway on Mourinho's sacking by Chelsea: \"Football has gone mad. He is one of the best managers in the world. I'm devastated. I was learning from him from afar. He makes you feel 25-foot tall and I'm going to sorely miss him.\" Barcelona vice-president Carles Vilarrubi on Mourinho's return to Chelsea: \"It is not good for English football. If Mourinho behaves like he did in Spain it will only be an unhappy relationship. In his three years in Spain he only created disagreements and arguments.

{"original_text": "Even with the usual caveats attached to opinion polls, a 65 to 17 majority for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK suggests little room for doubt. The British and Irish governments have both made it clear they don't think now is the time to hold a border poll. Sinn Fein are campaigning for a poll and the DUP have discussed, in their words, calling Sinn Fein's bluff. But after weeks of controversy about flags and national identity, politicians' claims about Catholic unionism, and a census showing a growing number identifying themselves as Northern Irish, what lies behind that headline figure in the Spotlight opinion poll is particularly revealing. Not surprisingly, more than 90 of those who identify themselves as Protestants told the pollsters they wanted to stay in the UK. But on the other side of the religious divide, a substantial 38 of Catholics also favoured remaining within the UK - three percentage points more than the number who backed a united Ireland. While only 5 of Protestants don't intend to vote or haven't decided which option they would pick, more than a quarter of Catholics are either undecided or not planning on voting. As avowed believers in a united Ireland and the party running a border poll campaign, Sinn Fein might be surprised to learn that nearly a quarter of those who identified themselves as Sinn Fein voters - 23 - told the pollsters they would back the status quo in a border poll. More than half of SDLP supporters - 56 - also said they would opt to stay in the UK if a poll was held tomorrow. Prime Minister David Cameron said the survey for the BBC Spotlight programme on the potential outcome of a border poll should lift the spirits of all those who value Northern Ireland's place within the union. The results of the 2011 census, released in December last year, revealed that just over a fifth of the population considers itself \"Northern Irish.\" That posed a political puzzle - in a border poll would these people tick a British or an Irish box? Well, those who identified themselves as \"Northern Irish\" for the BBC Spotlight poll back staying in the UK by a significant margin - 72 to just 7. At the DUP conference late last year Peter Robinson hinted that his party hopes to make inroads into Catholic unionist territory. Since then commentators have expressed the view that the union flag dispute and the ensuing protests make this a pipe dream. The Spotlight survey suggests the main parties have a long way to go to reach across the religious divide. Those identifying themselves as DUP supporters are 97 Protestant, while UUP supporters are 99 Protestant. Those backing Sinn Fein are 99 Catholic, while SDLP supporters are 92 Catholic. Alliance, as an identifiably centre ground party, is the one bucking the trend - with 51 Protestant backing and 36 Catholic support. Alliance's support for a \"designated days\" flag flying policy at Belfast City Hall stirred controversy and led to attacks on the party's offices and a death threat against its only MP, Naomi Long. However the Spotlight poll suggests raising the flag on 18 designated days is the most popular compromise across the community as a whole. Of those interviewed, 44 backed the designated days policy, in comparison to 35 wanting the union flag raised throughout the year. A further 10 told the pollsters no flag should be flown at the City Hall, while only 2 opted for the union flag flying alongside the Irish tricolour. Although designated days was the most popular option, flag flying polarises unionists and nationalists. 73 of unionists want the union flag up at Belfast City Hall 365 days a year, while 64 of nationalists support the 18 day policy. Even though the designated days compromise got more support than any other option, just over half of those interviewed thought the union flag protestors were right to take to the streets when Belfast City Council made its decision in early December. This result may reflect some people's belief in the right to protest, even if they don't back the aim of a particular demonstration. However this support appears to have dwindled sharply during the course of January, as by the time the Spotlight survey was carried out more than three quarters of interviewees wanted the protests to stop. They told the pollsters this was for a variety of reasons, the main ones being the violence sparked by some protests and the disruptive impact on business. Although the Stormont politicians might take heart from this shift of opinion, the protest organisers will point to the fact that by late January 45 of unionists still believed the demonstrations should continue. This shows a degree of resilience given the barrage of negative publicity generated by the protests.

Previously, researchers had wondered whether the one-legged position might help reduce muscle fatigue, as the birds alternated from standing on one leg to the other. Other teams have proposed that this behaviour helps regulate body temperature. Now, Prof Young-Hui Chang, from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) in Atlanta, and Lena H Ting, of Atlanta's Emory University, have uncovered the mechanical secrets behind this impressive trick. The researchers conducted several experiments with both live and dead birds. Amazingly, they found that flamingo cadavers could be made to stand one-legged without any external support. In a paper published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, they describe this phenomenon as a \"passive gravitational stay mechanism.\" \"If you look at the bird from the front, while they're standing on one leg, the foot is directly beneath the body which means that their leg is angled inward. That's the pose you have to strike in order to engage the stay mechanism,\" Prof Chang told BBC News. However, dead birds cannot stand unsupported on two legs, suggesting a greater role for active muscle force in this posture: \"If you tilt it to the vertical, like you would if you were standing on two legs, the whole thing disengages,\" said the director of the Comparative Neuromechanics Laboratory at Georgia Tech. The researchers also studied live birds, and showed that when they were standing one-legged and resting, they hardly moved at all - underlining the stability of this passive position. However, the birds did sway somewhat when the one-legged posture was combined with an activity, such as grooming or calling out. Prof Chang said the underlying anatomical apparatus that enables the passive posture was not yet understood - this is the next step in the team's research. But he explained that the phenomenon did not involve the limb joints locking. \"A lock would imply that it's fixed in both directions. What we found is that it's fixed in one direction, but flexible in the other direction, so we call it a'stay' rather than a'lock'. It's more akin to a doorstop,\" he told me. Dr Matthew Anderson, an experimental psychologist who specialises in animal behaviour at St Joseph's University in Philadelphia, described the team's results as a \"significant step forward.\" The researcher, who was not involved with the latest study, added: \"They begin to answer the question of how flamingos are able to rest on one leg. Importantly, these authors do not examine when and where flamingos actually utilise the behaviour in question, and thus this paper does not really address the issue of why flamingos rest while on one leg.\" Dr Anderson's own research suggests that the birds adopt the unusual posture in order to conserve heat. Among other things, his team found that the number of birds resting on one leg falls as temperatures rise. \"Providing evidence of the mechanism that supportsallows for the behaviour to occur does not necessarily provide insight into why it happens in the first place.\" Follow Paul on Twitter.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "It may be their signature pose, but how and why the birds perch on one limb has been a longstanding puzzle.

It ran from 2008 to 2012 following coaching spells at Newcastle United and Norwich City. For a while he was a huge prospect down south, famously taking League One Huddersfield on a 43-match unbeaten run. Backed by chairman Dean Hoyle, the remit for Clark was to take The Terriers into the Championship. Twice they made the play-offs. Twice they failed to go up. Eventually patience ran out and in February 2012 Clark was sacked following a 1-0 defeat to Sheffield United - a decision that looked harsh considering Clark had only lost three of his previous 55 league matches to that point. Hoyle wanted promotion and got it, with Clark's replacement, Simon Grayson, delivering via the play-offs. One of Clark's last signings for Huddersfield was Kallum Higginbotham - a player he will be reunited with at Kilmarnock. Clark would graduate to the Championship with Birmingham City but it was a time of turmoil at the club. Twice he preserved their status in the division, albeit survival in the 2013-14 season was secured by the tightest of margins - an injury-time goal from former Celtic player Paul Caddis keeping them up on goal difference. But a poor start to the following season saw Clark sacked in October 2014. His last managerial stint was an unhappy one as he immediately moved to Blackpool, who were bottom of the Championship. Relegation followed and he resigned in May 2015. Rae thinks it would be wrong to read too much into this dismal spell at the Seasiders. \"The one thing about working for Blackpool - I was there as well - it is a really tough, tough environment to work in,\" he said. \"The downsizing in terms of the playing budget almost made it impossible to succeed there. I would not judge Lee on that last tenure.\" The Killie board clearly like what they see in Clark but he is entering an environment he has little experience of.

You could build a paper mountain out of all the plans to give vocational education the same status as university degrees, There are several reasons why vocational education has struggled to achieve the same status as university education. First, there is a long-standing cultural bias that values academic education over vocational education. This bias is particularly strong in many Western countries, where university degrees are seen as the key to social mobility and success, while vocational education is often seen as a second-best option. Second, vocational education has often been associated with low-status jobs and low pay. This has led to a perception that vocational education is less valuable than university education, despite the fact that many vocational careers can be highly rewarding in terms of job satisfaction and financial remuneration. Third, there has historically been a lack of investment in vocational education and training, particularly in terms of resources and infrastructure. This has made it difficult for vocational education to keep pace with changing industry needs and maintain high standards of quality.

The ONS figures show that UK house prices have increased five times faster than wages since 2011, according to the Resolution Foundation, which campaigns to improve living standards. Its analysis of the ONS data shows that house prices have increased by 36 over the past five years. Average weekly earnings have gone up by just 7 over the same period, it said. The think-tank said the growth gap between wages and house prices was even more pronounced in London and the South East. But even in Scotland and the North, house prices have risen at twice the rate of wages. However the ONS data shows that prices in Scotland fell by 6.1 in the year to March 2016. Recent surveys by both the Halifax and Nationwide have suggested that house price growth has already cooled since the stamp duty changes came into effect. The ONS said house price growth in March was particularly driven by London, where the cost of a house or flat rose by 13 over the year. In its last survey using the current methodology, the ONS said the average cost of a home in the UK reached PS292,000 in March."}

The American regains the number one ranking from German Angelique Kerber. Australia's Margaret Court, with 24, is the only player still ahead of Serena in terms of Grand Slam singles titles. \"Congratulations Serena on number 23,\" said Venus, who at 36 is the oldest Australian Open finalist in the Open era. \"I have been right there with you, some of them I lost right there against you. It's been an awesome win. \"I'm enormously proud of you, you mean the world to me. I, God willing, would love to come back. Thank you for all the love.\" Serena paid tribute to her sister, who was playing her first major final for eight years, saying: \"There's no way I would be at 23 without her. There's no way I'd be at one without her. She's my inspiration. \"She's the only reason I'm standing here today. She's the only reason the Williams sisters exist. Thank you for inspiring me. Every time you won this week, I felt like I got a win too.\" Serena went into the match as a strong favourite, but the tension was apparent as early as the third game when she smashed a racquet in frustration, receiving a code violation. She had broken serve in the first and third games only to hand the advantage straight back each time, three double faults inexplicably littering a desperate game for 2-2. It was clear the six-time champion was struggling to settle, with 13 unforced errors in the opening five games, while elder sister Venus kept her under pressure with some deep hitting. The decisive move of the set came with a superb drop volley followed by a thumping forehand winner from Serena to break for 4-3, and this time she managed to consolidate on serve. In contrast to the opening stages, the following nine games went with serve - Venus recovering superbly from 0-40 early in the second set - but it was Serena who was creating the chances. She finally capitalised on her sixth break point of the set with a brilliant return to lead 4-3 and followed it up with her best service game of the match for 5-3. The crowd on Rod Laver Arena had been backing Venus from the beginning as she tried to win a first major title for eight years, and all the more so as defeat loomed and she appeared to struggle physically. There was a huge cheer when she held serve to force her sister to serve out the match, but Serena recovered from 15-30 to earn match point and fell back on the court in celebration as her sister sent the ball floating wide. Saturday's final was the 28th instalment of the sisters' on-court rivarly, which began at the Australian Open back in 1998, with Serena now 17-11 ahead and 7-2 up in Grand Slam finals. Venus, who turned professional in 1994 and has won five Wimbledon and two US Open titles, insisted she was not too disappointed after reaching her first major final since 2009. \"No, because I guess I've been here before, \"she said. \"I really enjoy seeing the name'Williams' on the trophy. This is a beautiful thing.\" Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent: Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Serena Williams is the length of time she has been winning Grand Slam titles. The first came on 11 September 1999 in New York; the 23rd on 28 January 2017 here in Melbourne. The match itself will quickly be forgotten; but never the achievement. Richard Williams used to beg tennis clubs to part with their old balls when he started to put his daughters through their paces in the Los Angeles district of Compton, and now Serena has more Grand Slam singles titles than anyone who has ever played the game, with the exception of Margaret Court. Williams is now just one behind the Australian - who was watching on the Rod Laver Arena - and in the view of the 18-time Grand Slam champion Martina Navratilova, it is a record she could \"shatter\" before her playing days are done.

After Monday's meeting, she said she had accepted the board members' resignations, and thanked them \"for their efforts in promoting and fostering sport during their time in office.\" In a statement, she said: \"Given the ongoing challenges in Sport NI, I am taking steps to intervene directly to support both staff and the remaining board members. \"I also wish to advise staff that their concerns are being taken seriously and that they will be fully addressed.\" Chair of the culture committee Nelson McCausland said the situation was \"shocking and unprecedented.\" \"That is why we need to get Caral Ni Chuilin in front of the committee as soon as possible,\" he said. \"It tells us something about the department and the way that the minister has been running the department,\" Mr McCausland told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster. \"We also want to talk to the people who resigned, they have a story as well. \"It is a whole quagmire, we need to get to the bottom of it. The minister owes that to the public, to Sport NI and to the committee.\" Ms Ni Chuilin said she would meet the remaining board members later this week. No-one from Sport NI was available for comment."}
{"original_text": "Experts reassembled pieces of tiles found amid tons of earth from the site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. They say the tiles date from the period of the Second Temple, during the time of King Herod about 2,000 years ago. The temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD during a Jewish rebellion. Some 600 segments of coloured stone floor have been found since archaeologists began examining the debris from the hilltop site in 2004. The plateau where the temples stood is the most sacred site in Judaism. It is joined by the Western Wall, venerated by Jews as part of the original supporting wall of the temple compound. Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) is also the place where Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad ascended to Heaven, and is the third holiest site in Islam. The archaeologists say the tiles probably came from porticos in the temple's courtyards. Piecing the fragments together \"enables us to get an idea of the Temple's incredible splendour,\" said Dr Gabriel Barkay of the Temple Mount Sifting Project. Experts say they managed to assemble seven potential designs of how the flooring could have looked like. The type of flooring is known as opus sectile, Latin for \"cut work,\" and \"considered to be far more prestigious than mosaic tiles floors,\" according to Frankie Snyder, from the project's team. \"The tile segments were perfectly inlaid such that one could not even insert a sharp blade between them,\" she said. The Temple Mount Sifting Project was established by Israeli archaeologists in 2004 to examine debris dumped by Islamic authorities following expansion work at an underground mosque on the compound. The project attracts thousands of visitors each year who participate in finger-tip searches of the earth and has so far turned up hundreds of ancient relics, including coins, animal bones and pieces of pottery.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "Experts reassembled pieces of tiles found amid tons of earth from the site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif.

{"original_text": "It was a scrappy effort, which saved the game from going to what had seemed an inevitable penalty shootout. Stevie Mallan though had earlier missed the game's best chance for the home side when he failed to score from the penalty spot. St Mirren now lead Group G by three points. It might have been picture postcard weather for the first half in Paisley, but there wasn't much to write home about. St Mirren were too predictable with long balls floated forward for John Sutton and David Clarkson up front, although Mallan's dead ball delivery was, as always, a threat. Ayr started well enough and Paul Cairney had a real early chance, but after that Saints looked comfortable at the back. St Mirren's best chance of the half fell for Calum Gallacher who got on to the end of a lovely ball from Clarkson. It was screaming for the first-time volley, but he chose the wrong option in taking a touch and the opportunity melted in the evening sun. Things, we hoped, could only get better in the second half. They did. A bit. Lewis Morgan was highly impressive down the left side for the home team, embracing the concept of dazzling wing play and hitting the by-line before delivering the cross. But no-one could cash in. He won his team a penalty with another dazzling run. The usually deadly Mallan took the spot kick, but United goalkeeper Greg Fleming produced a wonderful save to his right hand side to urge the game toward further penalties after 90 minutes. But then central defender Baird chipped in with his last-minute effort, bundling the ball over the line after a scramble in the box. Enough to set Saints proudly at the top of their section.

{"original_text": "It may be their signature pose, but how and why the birds perch on one limb has been a longstanding puzzle. Now, a team from the US has shown that birds can do this without tipping over because of their unique skeletal anatomy and muscular control. Their legs have a built-in locking mechanism that keeps their joints in place even when they are not actively using their muscles to stand. The reason why birds perch on one limb is to conserve body heat. By tucking one leg up into their feathers, they reduce the surface area that is exposed to the cold air, which helps them to stay warm. Additionally, standing on one leg also allows them to keep the other leg warm by tucking it into their feathers as well. Overall, the ability of birds to perch on one limb is a fascinating adaptation that reflects their evolutionary success and the incredible diversity of the natural world.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Birds perch on one limb because they are able to conserve body heat, according to a new study by scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)."}

And if Murray had been expected to dominate proceedings on his return home, the opening day ended with Ward acclaimed by the 7,700 spectators at the Emirates Arena. \"This is by far the best atmosphere I've ever been involved in and thank you very much to all the crowd,\" said Ward. \"It was difficult.

Ward has been in the best form of his career over the last 12 months, however, and backed up by a gruelling off-season training block with Murray, he dug in and worked his way back into the contest. Two terrific passes helped him finally break the Isner serve in the third set and the Briton levelled in a tie-break as the momentum swung steadily in his favour. Ward dominated the decider, earning a break point and then five match points, only for the 6ft 10in Isner to keep him at bay with his huge serve. With no tie-break in the deciding set, the games ticked by, prompting memories of Isner's 11-hour marathon against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon 2010.

Ward has been in the best form of his career over the last 12 months, however, and backed up by a gruelling off-season training block with Murray, he dug in and worked his way back into the contest. Two terrific passes helped him finally break the Isner serve in the third set and the Briton levelled in a tie-break as the momentum swung steadily in his favour. Ward dominated the decider, earning a break point and then five match points, only for the 6ft 10in Isner to keep him at bay with his huge serve. With no tie-break in the deciding set, the games ticked by, prompting memories of Isner's 11-hour marathon against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon 2010. Ward had his own moment of danger at 11-11 but saved two break points, the second in a long and desperately tense rally, but for the most part he looked the more likely winner. Media playback is not supported on this device It took until the 28th game of a gripping final set but there was no escape when Isner slipped 0-40 down, and he netted a volley to spark wild celebrations among the British squad. Ward shared a long hug with Murray, who had been dispensing advice via Smith from the sidelines throughout. The Scot had earlier seen off Young with a fine display in front of his home crowd, who gave him a rousing reception. \"It was very nice,\" said the Scot. \"I used the energy and emotion very well at the beginning of the match. I would say I played extremely well. \"I'm going to praise myself today - I hit one unforced error in two sets.\""}
{"original_text": "Prof Allyson Pollock and colleagues at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous. They do not want an outright ban but say the sport must change and safeguards are needed. The Rugby Football Union said steps had been taken to make the sport safer. The RFU says the physical and social benefits that rugby offers to children \"massively outweigh any potential drawbacks\" and that myriad safety measures are already in place. These include the provision of a safe environment through investment in pitches and facilities, ensuring adequate first aid and medical facilities, and fully training coaches in methods to prevent injuries to young players. Ministers also want to see more children taking up sport. In 2012, then Culture Minister Jeremy Hunt announced a plan to link up thousands of schools with rugby clubs. But Prof Pollock fears there are not enough safety checks and measures to support this, meaning children could get hurt. She wants to see an increase in the recording of injuries and better injury prevention analysis. She claims that, compared with New Zealand, the UK has few strategies to protect players. Each season, children have about a one in 10 chance of getting injured badly enough that they need at least seven days off the pitch. Some injuries are minor, but others can cause permanent disability. Most rugby injuries occur during the tackle, as players collide at speed. But scrums are the most dangerous part of play, where some of the most serious injuries occur, Prof Pollock and colleagues say in their report in the British Medical Journal. Concussion and spinal trauma are the big concerns. Some injuries can prove fatal - as the Robinson family from County Antrim know only too well after their 14-year-old son, Ben, died having been hurt in a school rugby match in 2011. He collapsed at the end of that match after he was involved in a series of heavy tackles. An inquest heard that the teenager died from brain injuries. Prof Pollock says not enough is being done to put in place injury monitoring and prevention strategies - and little is known about what really works. \"Only by collecting injury data and by providing feedback to individuals and organisations working on safety initiatives will the short - and long-term impact of injury prevention programmes, whether for rugby or any other sport, be known,\" she said. She added some measures - such as matching child rugby players by size rather than age, playing only non-contact matches and having fewer players on the pitch at any one time - may help reduce the frequency of the most severe injuries. The RFU says set-phase play such as scrums and line-outs are introduced gradually, according to a child's rugby development, with scrums initially only containing three players per side and are uncontested. An RFU spokesman said: \"We take player safety extremely seriously, and this is at the core of all the training we deliver to coaches, referees and medics, at all levels of the game. \"Rugby for young people at schools or clubs in England exists in different forms, both contact and non-contact. \"Significant work has been undertaken over a number of years to develop new rules of play to ensure maximum possible safety, with a structured progression to cover the introduction, playing, teaching and refereeing of the game from under-seven to under-18.\" A government spokesman said: \"Player safety in schools and at all levels of sport is absolutely paramount and sports governing bodies and the government are completely committed to it. \"The rugby governing bodies work hard to ensure the sport in schools is played as safely as possible and that young people reap the benefits of participating - boosting their health, self-esteem and encouraging teamwork.\"", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "Prof Allyson Pollock and colleagues at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous.

{"original_text": "Foredowne Boarding Kennel is facing allegations about how dogs, seized by Devon and Cornwall Police and placed there, were kept without exercise. The licensing authority, Teignbridge Council, said it was investigating. The kennel said it was staffed by \"animal lovers who work tirelessly to care and rehabilitate the dogs.\" The RSPCA announced on Friday it had agreed with the Devon and Cornwall Police force's request to review the way in which dogs seized under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 were cared for in kennels. Whistleblowers have made a series of allegations about dogs being put in 3ft by 9ft cages and then, due to safety concerns, not exercised. These include Stella, who had been caged for nearly two years, and Vinnie, a Rottweiler who whistleblowers said had also not been exercised. The BBC has also been told that three puppies, brought in at 11-weeks old, were briefly walked before being denied exercise. Further claims have been made that stray dogs brought in by local councils were also denied exercise. Devon and Cornwall Police are understood to have used the kennels to place a number of seized dogs but said since 2012 they had only instructed staff not to exercise four of these. However, current and former members of staff have said as many as 20 dogs had'Do Not Enter' signs on their cages. Former kennel manager David Clark said in the three years he worked there he did not see those dogs exercised. A spokesman for the kennels said: \"The puppies were walked regularly, as part of their kennel enrichment activities. However, we carry out regular risk assessments, and for these particular dogs, as they came into maturity they started to show signs of aggression. \"We did have to stop the walks during the final few weeks of their stay with us. \"One member of staff was bitten and, of course, we do have to take into account the breed characteristics of their parents, both very dangerous dogs.\" The spokesman said the kennels had cared for many dogs over the years, and had \"an excellent working relationship with Devon and Cornwall Police.\" The spokesman said: \"We are animal lovers and work tirelessly to care and rehabilitate the dogs that come to us from the police, but unfortunately sometimes the risks are too great. \"We would of course welcome and fully support any investigation by the council or RSPCA. We are confident that we have abided by all the relevant rules and regulations.\" A spokeswoman for Teignbridge District Council said: \"We take all complaints of animal welfare seriously and will be carrying out an investigation into the specific allegations that have been made.\" Pit bulls Smokey and Lola were seized by police from the same owner over suspicions that the dogs were trained to attack. Their three puppies were seized at the same time. Mr Clark said: \"The three pit bull terrier pups came in at 11 weeks. They were initially exercised before deteriorating so much they were deemed unsafe. \"The police were informed and they went on to do at least six months with no exercise.\" In a statement, Ch Supt Jim Nye said: \"Since 2012, we have seized and placed into kennels in the region of 200 dogs, of which only four were given a strict order not to exercise by Devon and Cornwall Police due to the dog's unpredictable and dangerous nature.\" He said they included Stella, Gnasha - another pit bull, Smokey and Lola. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police added: \"As regards any other dogs the kennel has chosen not to walk during this time - there may be some - that is a decision made by the kennel as part of their duty of care for the animals they have. \"While we have individual care plans for all dogs which we have seized, ultimately the kennel maintains this duty of care.\"", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "Foredowne Boarding Kennel is facing allegations about how dogs, seized by Devon and Cornwall Police and placed there, were kept without exercise.

{"original_text": "All examples of this group, known as the Archosauromorpha, lay eggs. This led some scientists to wonder whether there was something in their biology that prevented live births. But examination of the fossil remains of a very long-necked, 245 million-year-old marine reptile from China revealed it was carrying an embryo. Jun Liu, first author of the new study in Nature Communications, told BBC News that the animal would have measured between three and four metres long, with a neck that was about 1.7m long. The embryo may have been around half a metre long and is positioned inside the rib cage of the adult Dinocephalosaurus fossil, which was discovered in 2008 in Luoping County, Yunnan Province in southern China. Researchers had to consider whether the smaller animal might have been part of the adult's last meal. But it's facing forward, whereas swallowed prey generally face backwards because predators consume the animal head first to help it go down the throat. Another line of evidence in favour of the live birth idea is that the small reptile inside the mother is clearly an example of the same species. Co-author Prof Mike Benton, from the University of Bristol, told BBC News that the fossil was important because the Archosauromorpha form one of three large groupings of land-based vertebrates (backboned animals), each including about 10,000 species. Since we now know that no fundamental biological barrier to live births exists in this group, palaeontologists would be \"looking very closely\" at other fossils. He suggested one target would be a group of aquatic crocodile relatives - whose mode of reproduction was not well known. Prof Liu, from Hefei University of Technology in China, said the discovery pushes back evidence of reproductive biology in the archosauromorphs by 50 million years. The mode of reproduction in Dinocephalosaurus also points to how the sex of its offspring was determined. Co-author Prof Chris Organ, from Montana State University, added: \"Some reptiles today, such as crocodiles, determine the sex of their offspring by the temperature inside the nest. \"We identified that Dinocephalosaurus, a distant ancestor of crocodiles, determined the sex of its babies genetically, like mammals and birds.\" Prof Benton explained: \"This combination of live birth and genotypic sex determination seems to have been necessary for animals such as Dinocephalosaurus to become aquatic. \"It's great to see such an important step forward in our understanding of the evolution of a major group coming from a chance fossil find in a Chinese field.\" The possibility that an eggshell once surrounded the embryo but was not preserved in fossilisation could not be ruled out, said Prof Benton. But living Archosauromorphs all lay eggs very early in embryonic development, whereas this embryo is very advanced, with well developed bones. Furthermore, the team says Dinocephalosaurus's long neck and other features of its anatomy suggest it could not have manoeuvred easily out of the water, meaning a reproductive strategy like that of turtles - which lay eggs on land before returning to the water - was probably not an option.
