{"original_text": "The term \"imperialism\" is often conflated with \"colonialism,\" however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition. Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe the expansionist and coercive policies of powerful countries or empires over other weaker nations or territories. Colonialism typically refers to the process of establishing political and economic control by a foreign power over a territory or land, which often involves the settlement of colonizers and the exploitation of natural resources and labor. Imperialism, on the other hand, refers to a broader set of policies and practices designed to extend the political, economic, andor cultural influence of one nation over another or several other countries, often through various means, such as military conquest, economic pressure or cultural dominance.

{"original_text": "In anglophone academic works, theories regarding imperialism are often based on the British experience. The term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism.

{"original_text": "To measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem, one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem. However, the running time may, in some cases, depend on the input size. For example, suppose we want to sort a list of n items. The running time of sorting algorithms such as quicksort or mergesort depend on the input size n. More precisely, the running time is usually expressed as a function of n (e.g., O (n log n) for quicksort), meaning that the running time grows as the input size grows. Thus, in practice, one often measures the running time of algorithms as a function of the input size, and analyzes how the running time grows as the input size increases. This allows us to compare the efficiency of different algorithms and determine which one is the most appropriate for a given problem size. Additionally, it can also help us determine if a problem is feasible to solve within a reasonable time, given the capabilities of modern computers.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "The running time is a measure of the time it takes an algorithm to solve a given problem, and is often expressed as a function of the input size."}

{"original_text": "By 1620 the Huguenots were on the defensive, and the government increasingly applied pressure. A series of three small civil wars known as the Huguenot rebellions broke out, mainly in the southern and western provinces of France. These rebellions were motivated by Huguenot fears of being suppressed by the Catholic government and by resentment over the loss of political power and influence they had once enjoyed. The first Huguenot rebellion began in 1621 and was quickly put down by the Catholic forces. The second rebellion took place in 1622 and was more significant, with Huguenot forces inflicting a major defeat on the royal army at the Battle of Saint-Martin-de-Re. However, they were eventually defeated and forced to surrender. The third and final Huguenot rebellion began in 1627, and this time the government was better prepared. Catholic forces, led by Cardinal Richelieu, launched a siege of the Huguenot stronghold of La Rochelle, which lasted for over a year. The city finally surrendered in 1628, marking the end of the Huguenot rebellions. After the rebellions were put down, the government increasingly restricted the rights of Huguenots, including banning their religious assemblies and preventing them from holding public office.

Without this counterbalance, corporations have been able to pay lower wages and benefits, which has contributed to the widening income gap.

Supporters of Islamism aim to create a state governed by Islamic law, where the religious ideal overrides modern secular values and law.

{"original_text": "The relationship of ctenophores to the rest of Metazoa is very important to our understanding of the early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. It has been the subject of much research and debate. The current consensus among researchers is that ctenophores are the earliest diverging lineage of the animal kingdom, meaning they are the first to have evolved from a common ancestor with all other animals. This makes them a key player in understanding the evolution of animal multicellularity, as they may have evolved unique cellular and developmental mechanisms that were later lost or modified in other lineages. Additionally, recent molecular studies suggest that ctenophores may be more closely related to cnidarians (jellyfish, corals, etc.) than to other animals such as sponges, which had been thought to be their closest relatives. This revision to the traditional view of ctenophore relationships has important implications for understanding the evolution of complex traits such as nervous systems and biomineralization.

{"original_text": "Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two. However, there are some distinct differences between imperialism and colonialism. Imperialism refers to the policy and practice of extending the power and influence of a nation over other nations, usually by means of military force or economic coercion. In imperialism, a more powerful country dominates a weaker country or region, with the goal of controlling resources and expanding its territory and sphere of influence. On the other hand, colonialism involves the settlement of people from a powerful country in a weaker country or region, with the goal of controlling resources and exploiting indigenous populations. It often involves the establishment of a colonial administration and the imposition of the colonizer's culture, language, and laws onto the local population. In summary, imperialism is the broader practice of extending the power and influence of a dominant country over weaker countries, while colonialism is a specific type of imperialism that involves the settlement of people from the dominant country in the weaker country or region.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker, and columnist Ahmed Rashid looks at the differences between imperialism and colonialism, and how they affect the lives of people living in them."}

{"original_text": "Both X.25 and Frame Relay provide connection-oriented operations. But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDsthe virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLCLAPDLAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS.

{"original_text": "Even before Washington returned, Dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men under William Trent to that point, where in the early months of 1754 they began construction of a small fortification they called Fort Trent. However, when Washington arrived at the site in April, he found the fortification inadequate for defense, and instead began construction of a larger structure he called Fort Necessity. This fort was situated in a low-lying area surrounded by trees, making it vulnerable to attack. Nonetheless, Washington and his men worked to reinforce the fortification with trenches and wooden palisades. On July 3, 1754, a force of French soldiers led by Captain Louis Coulon de Villiers arrived at Fort Necessity and opened fire on Washington and his men. Although Washington and his soldiers fought valiantly, they were outnumbered, and after ten hours of intermittent fighting, they were forced to surrender. The French allowed Washington and his men to return home with their weapons, but they forced them to sign a document admitting to the murder of French soldiers and agreeing to leave the Ohio Valley. The Battle of Fort Necessity was the opening salvo in the French and Indian War, a conflict that would shape the course of American history. It would also establish Washington's reputation as a brave and resourceful military leader, paving the way for his future success as the commander of the Continental Army during the American Revolution.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "George Washington returned to the site of the Battle of Fort Necessity in the Ohio Valley in 1754 to defend it against French and Indian soldiers."}

Education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high er earning potential and greater opportunities for career advancement.

Individuals from affluent families tend to have greater access to quality education and are more likely to attend prestigious universities, while those from lower-income families may only be able to attend under-resourced schools and community colleges. This creates a cycle of inequality, where those who are already privileged are more likely to continue to thrive while those who are struggling to get by are more likely to struggle even further.
