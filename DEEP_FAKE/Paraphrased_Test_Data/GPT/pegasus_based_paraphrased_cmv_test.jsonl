However, you also want to make sure that the tattoo is meaningful to you and that you won't regret it later on. Take some time to reflect on why you want the tattoo and what it represents to you. It's also important to find a reputable tattoo artist who can help you bring your vision to life. Don't just go to the cheapest artist or the one that's closest to you.

{"original_text": "First, let me clarify by saying I don't support actual, intentional bashing of any kind, however: We see jokes about it (especially on Reddit) all the time: political correctness is reaching a ludicrous level in our everyday society. It is getting to the point where you can't even make jokes or off-hand remarks without being considered rude, distasteful, ignorant, what ever. I think this is not only not really helpful to a person or group of persons who are facing adversity, it is detrimental. It causes issues that could be making actual progress to falter and nit-pick all of the tiniest little problems they can find rather than strive for real change. It is inadvertently focussing on the negativity in society rather than trying to find a positive solution. It is my opinion that the only way to get past adversity in life is to toughen up and become immune to it and push your way through it. Real change comes about because of real actions. This post was inspired by the earlier discussion on the use of the word \"cisgendered\" and wether it is \"normal\" or wether we should then be differentiating the difference between diabetics and nondiabetics and so forth. I don't think this is a helpful debate overall. sure, if you are asking what gender someone is, it is okay, even good, to distinguish, but all I keep seeing around here, and in real life, and at an increasing rate, is how we all need to check our privilege and be more and more sympathetic; how white people can't relate to minority problems, men can't relate to women's suffrage, cisgendered people can't really understand what transgendered people go through... it just keeps getting more and more specific, and in my opinion, its just focussing everyone's attention on what is wrong with the world, and doesn't actually help us make it better. Adversity is everywhere, it hits everyone. I may be a man, but maybe my dad sexually abused me and locked me in the basement my whole childhood. That girl may be white, but maybe she was raised in a seedy part of town with a drug addicted prostitute mother. Maybe that guy is a straight white male from a nice neighborhood, but he was somehow infected with HIV and now he has AIDS. My point is, none of those people are going to get through their hardships by focussing on those things they can't change, doing so would only hinder their own growth. I can't help but think the same thing when I hear about someone getting upset about someone else using language they find to be offensive. Again, I'm not saying bullying is okay, but the line between what is considered okay to joke about, and what is borderline a hate crime seems to be getting thinner and thinner. In my eyes, trying to further political correctness is only babying everyone and hindering actual growth. TL;DR There is no relative degree of suffering, everyone has a hard life, and trying to force everyone to walk on eggshells all the time doesn't help anyone make their life better.

You have to consider that in a wireless mouse you have to think about the battery level and remember to keep it topped up to avoid not being able to use the mouse. No such problem exists with a wired mouse. 2. A wireless mouse requires two pieces of equipment (the mouse and the USB stick). A fault in either of those and you may not use your mouse. Also, you could end up with connectivity problems sometimes (granted this is unlikely due to the distance from the computer). 3. One could argue mobility is the key factor behind a wireless mouse. However, how often are you going to be so far away from your computer to the point where your cable wouldn't reach? You may do a presentation and want to click remotely, but unless you're doing them everyday, it doesn't compensate. 4. A wired mouse is cheaper and does the exact same thing. 5. You could argue that cables get tangled and make a mess, especially considering the number already attached to a computerlaptop.

You have to consider that in a wireless mouse you have to think about the battery level and remember to keep it topped up to avoid not being able to use the mouse. No such problem exists with a wired mouse. 2. A wireless mouse requires two pieces of equipment (the mouse and the USB stick). A fault in either of those and you may not use your mouse. Also, you could end up with connectivity problems sometimes (granted this is unlikely due to the distance from the computer). 3. One could argue mobility is the key factor behind a wireless mouse. However, how often are you going to be so far away from your computer to the point where your cable wouldn't reach? You may do a presentation and want to click remotely, but unless you're doing them everyday, it doesn't compensate. 4. A wired mouse is cheaper and does the exact same thing. 5. You could argue that cables get tangled and make a mess, especially considering the number already attached to a computerlaptop. I counter this saying that sure, a wireless mouse may be neater, but the cable from the wired mouse hardly gets in the way. It goes behind my notebook or computer and I barely see it. Out of sight and out of mind. Considering the five points above, Change my view."}
{"original_text": "I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was pretty annoyed to discover that [aspects of the film's plot were warped for the purpose of making it more dramatic] . I do not think any good comes of this, and to be honest it makes me quite mad. For example, in the film, the main character Alan Turing is portrayed by the actor as obviously autistic to some extent, but according to a quote on Wikipedia (not sure exactly who said it) \"the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film.... bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing.\" This, I think, is insulting to Turing's memory, to customise his personality as to make the film more interesting or to make the audience more sympathetic towards his character. Sometimes it's less minor than character modification. I distinctly remember watching 13 Days (2000) in a high school history class to supplement our Cold War study. This film ramped up the'Soviets are evil and JFK is a god' theme to the point of including an entirely fictional battle scene, but went out of its way to present itself as a historically accurate film, including real Cold War footage throughout. We watched it in history class for god's sake! It's also been criticised for attributing a major role in the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis to Kenneth O'Donnell - somebody who was actually there argues that \"For God's sakes, Kenny O'Donnell didn't have any role whatsoever.... that's absurd.\" I think overblowing or underplaying real people's roles in history is just insulting, and cannot be justified. Thus, I am suggesting that films which are'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred. I will pre-argue some anticipated arguments in advance: \"They're claiming to be based on a true story, not perfectly historically accurate.\" Yes, but these films spread misinformation all the same. People take'based on truth' to mean'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films appear as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dateseventsquotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can). It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun. \"The aim of a film is to entertain, it is not meant to be a history lesson.\" But to some extent, they are taken as such all the same.

You're right that it's important to question the reasons behind our desires. There are many alternatives to having biological children that you may want to consider. Adoption, for example, is a selfless act that provides children in need with a loving home. Foster care is also an option to consider. There are many children who would benefit from a stable and supportive home environment. Additionally, you can also consider working with children in your community by volunteering at a local organization, mentoring a child, or even becoming a teacher or daycare provider. There are many ways to have a positive impact on the lives of children without necessarily having your own.

There are many variations of bottle designs, but overall we can group these into two categories: \"cap on top,\" where the cap is at the top of the bottle and as far from the base as possible, and \"cap on bottom\" where the bottle actually sits on its cap. Cap on bottom designs are a fairly recent invention, made possible by the use of arbitrary plastic shapes for liquid packaging. So I understand that cap on top designs are entrenched, culturally.

I would count that as a \"cap on bottom\" design because the bottle can sit on its cap without concern of toppling.

Many of my friends also feel the same way and I have seen a couple of them fail due to this rule. Usually after class, we all walk out complaining about all of the stupid reasons we got a bad grade on our essay. I may be missing something that makes \"you\" ruin an essay but I just can't see it."}
{"original_text": "Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap While the ideals of socialism and communism aim to create a society where everyone is equal, it is important to acknowledge that in practice, it has not always been successful. The implementation of these economic systems has often led to totalitarian regimes, the concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals, and lack of personal freedoms. It is also important to recognize that people have different motivations, talents, and abilities, which may affect their contribution to society. While socialism and communism strive to ensure that everyone is equal regardless of those differences, it can lead to a lack of motivation and effort to excel, which can stifle progress and innovation. An entirely equal and utopian society may be a difficult goal to achieve, but it is important to continue striving towards greater equality and access to opportunities for all individuals.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker, and columnist Ahmed Rashid looks at the history of socialism and communism and their potential to create an equal world."}

However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons: First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were \"more equal than the others.\" Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people's inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. Second of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it. If for example say USA will start implementing even minor socialists norms, then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers of USA and take away their jobs. Which is indeed the case with things like outsourcing and not so quickly growing USA economy. The solution for USA would then be to close itself up and live in a world where there are no imports or exports, this would protect its citizens from fierce external competition, but leave USA lacking behind in progress of all kinds. Examples for this are Venezuela or Columbia. All in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc. However this are minor elements, which I think, should otherwise be implemented in fierce Capitalist society, where in order to succeed you cannot rely on gov. support, but 95 on yourself.

Evolutionary theory is generally not considered something that you believe in, but since some Christians deny evolutionary theory they effectively don't believe in it. Also, I am going to be using Christianity as my reference religion, but other Abrahamic religions that contain the genesis story are applicable as well. The theory of evolution that gives an explanation as to our origins I believe is not compatible with Christianity. You cannot believe in evolution as well as the Christian genesis story because they directly contradict each other. The Christian genesis story states that god created man in his current form, while evolutionary theory explains that life took millions of years to evolve and that our species is descended from a common ancestor with the other primates. If you are a Christian who believes in evolution as opposed to the genesis story and claim that the Christian genesis is just a metaphor, you open the door for the entire rest of the bible to be just a metaphor as well. Beyond that, if you claim that Christian genesis is just a metaphor because it isn't actually true in a literal sense, then you can further extend that the entire bible isn't true in a literal sense. If someone were to claim that only the genesis story is a metaphor but the rest is literally true, then that person has effectively filtered the bible themselves. For a person to pick and choose what is real and what is not in a sacred book is to not hold the book sacred. Finally, for a person to not hold the bible sacred is to not be a Christian.

A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a degree or diploma, typically after completing a university or college programme. However, this trend has emerged as a way to celebrate and acknowledge children's transition from one stage of education to another. While some people argue that celebrating these milestones can boost children's self-esteem and provide a sense of accomplishment, others criticize this trend for trivializing the significance of an actual graduation from secondary school or university. Moreover, some argue that it puts unnecessary pressure on children to perform and achieve certain academic milestones at very young ages.

{"original_text": "I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer do that? It's important to acknowledge that not all police officers act in this way and that the vast majority of police officers do their jobs with integrity and professionalism. However, when incidents like these do occur, there can be a variety of factors at play. One possible factor is a lack of adequate training or resources. Police officers are often the first responders in high-pressure situations that can escalate quickly, and they need to be equipped to make split-second decisions in highly stressful and dangerous situations. If they don't have the appropriate training or resources, they may be more likely to make mistakes or use excessive force. Another factor is the culture within law enforcement agencies. There have been cases where officers who have used excessive force or acted inappropriately have not faced consequences for their actions. This can create a culture of impunity, where officers feel that they can act with impunity and without fear of consequences. Additionally, implicit biases may come into play. Many police officers are trained to be vigilant and look out for signs of danger, and this can often be useful. However, if they have implicit biases against certain groups of people, they may be more likely to see them as threatening or dangerous, even if there is no evidence to support that perception. Overall, it's necessary to invest in better training and resources for police officers, to create a culture of accountability and consequences for wrongdoing, and to continue working to address implicit biases within law enforcement.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "In our series of letters from African-American journalists, novelist and writer Ta-Nehisi Coates looks at why police officers make mistakes and what can be done about it."}
{"original_text": "The title mentions specifically a tattoo on the forearm, but the underlying premise of my argument is based on a tattoo which would not be visible in formal clothing (such as slacks and a button down) but would be visible in casual wear (shorts and T-shirt). Such a tattoo would not affect chances of college acceptance for three reasons; the ubiquity of tattoos amongst college-aged individuals, the relative unimportance of personal image in the college acceptance process, and the low chance of anyone even seeing the tattoo. According to a Pew Research Centre report, nearly 38 of college-aged individuals have a tattoo. While that is not a majority by quite a margin, it is a significant amount. Additionally, the popularity and accessibility of tattoos are steadily increasing year by year leading to a greater acceptance amongst a younger crowd. The point here is that because of their widespread nature, tattoos are no longer seen as a sign of rebellion simply because they are so commonplace. Furthermore, most colleges prefer to accept or deny students based on their applications alone, rather than on interviews. Unlike a job interview, in which personal image can make or break someone's chances of getting employment, colleges tend to focus more on scholastic and athletic merit, test scores, and lifetime achievements first. Personal image is last on the docket for a school good enough to conduct personal interviews, if even considered at all. The previous two points also assume that a college will know about this tattoo, whereas that may not even be the case. In an interview process, there is no chance that the tattoo will be exposed in formal clothing. If the tattoo is exposed after acceptance, then there is no risk of a college retroactively denying admission based on that alone. This third point is also the keystone argument when it comes to employment. For the sake of this argument, I will assume that if an employer knows about any sort of tattoo, it will result in immediately being passed over for the job.

But I'm hesitant to make the purchase, as I barely use my XBox controller. I have tried several times to get used to playing with a controller - even reinstalling old games and starting with the controller to familiarize myself - and I always go back to'mouse and keyboard'. Below are the reasons I think'mouse and keyboard' is the best way to play PC games (really: any game, but KM is really only an option on the PC). The mouse is infinitely more precise than a controller. I can't even imagine playing FPS games with a controller (mostly, I've been playing 3rd-person action games a la Arkham and Tomb Raider). I know many FPS games use an aim assist system to compensate for the imprecision of a controller. I would rather have a more precise input system than an'assist' to compensate for the imprecision of my input device. Because we use them all the time, a keyboard is intuitive. Most of us use computer keyboards and mice on a daily basis in our work. Every QWERTY keyboard has the same layout. When a game tells me'press X', I know exactly where X is. Even people who are very familiar with controller layouts haven't spent nearly as much time with that controller as they have with a keyboard and mouse. Keyboard and mouse work for all games. As I mentioned, I prefer the precision of KM for FPS games. But I'm also a big-time RTS and strategy gamer (Total War are my favorite games) and there's no way I could imagine playing strategy games with a controller. KM works for everything. I even preferred Dark Souls with a KM - a game that many will say is only playable with a controller. I am perfectly comfortable in my computer chair. One of the big advantages I often hear about controllers is the ability to play from the couch. I prefer to be close to my display (I play on a 32in TV and sit about 3 feet back). My keyboard and mouse sit on a laptop desk and my computer chair is very comfortable. I feel more engaged in my games at the distance I sit vs. sitting on the couch. Why I want my view changed: I think the Steam controller looks really cool, but I'm not sure I'd use it. I don't want to make a purchase I won't use. Am I missing out on good experiences that only a controller can offer? I've got a device I barely use. I would like to use it more, if there are games in which using it would give me a better experience. Edit: many good suggestions in this thread so far. I'm going to spend a few minutes playing some of the types of games mentioned (stealth, action, driving, etc.) and see if the controller enhances the experience. Edit 2: Hey everyone. Thanks so much for the discussion. Lots of good points made, but I think the best was made by ustoopydumbut, who suggested that using a controller adds an additional level of challenge. Props, also, to all the users who pointed out the genres of games (racing, fighting, flight sims) that I don't play, but benefit from a controller. I am going to make it point to use my controller as often as I can going forward, and am still considering a Steam controller purchase.

{"original_text": "I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be the right and wrong thing to do in any given situation. While it's true that there can be cultural and individual differences in moral values and beliefs, the basic principles of morality are universally accepted. For example, most people believe that it's morally wrong to kill, steal, or harm others without a justifiable reason. These principles are not subjective, but rather based on the fundamental value of human life and well-being. However, there are some gray areas where moral judgments can be subjective, such as in cases where there is a clash between different moral principles or when there is a lack of consensus about what constitutes moral behavior. In these cases, people may have different opinions on what is right or wrong, but this doesn't necessarily mean that morality itself is subjective. Overall, it's important to recognize that morality is complex, and while there are objective principles that guide it, there is also room for debate and discussion about specific moral issues.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "In the wake of the Trayvon Martin shooting, many people have been asking whether morality is subjective, and I wanted to answer some of your questions about this topic."}

{"original_text": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is one of the most important resources for diagnosing mental disorders, and is utilised around the world by psychiatrists and psychologists alike. DSM 5 defines \"delusional disorder\" as a psychiatric illness, which is characterised by at least 1 month of delusions but no other psychotic symptoms. There are a number of other criteria though I am unsure if I can reproduce them here verbatim. In general, the other criteria include mostly unimpaired functioning, no obviously bizarre behaviour, no major manic or depressive episodes, no substance abuse, and no other identified mental disorder. The evidence for the efficacy of vaccinations is overwhelming and the benefits far outweigh the potential risks. Thus, a person who holds an anti-vaccination belief is delusional, and may be diagnosed as having delusional disorder. Because their anti-vaccination stance presents a risk to themselves (via contracting disease) or others (either via spreading disease, or preventing their children from being vaccinated), then this is grounds for involuntary admission and treatment in a psychiatric facility.

Spirited Away is considered a masterpiece of animation, and there are several reasons for its popularity and critical acclaim: 1. Emotional depth: Spirited Away is a coming of age story that deals with complex emotions such as loss, loneliness, and the struggle to find one's place in the world. The film's main character, Chihiro, goes through a transformative journey that resonates with viewers of all ages. 2. Beautiful animation: Spirited Away is an animated film that showcases some of the most breathtaking animation ever put on screen. From the intricate details of the spirit world to the diverse cast of supernatural creatures, the movie is a visual feast. 3. Cultural significance: Spirited Away is a Japanese film that incorporates traditional Japanese mythology and folklore. The film's exploration of Shintoism and its portrayal of Japanese culture has helped it become a cultural touchstone. 4. Unique storytelling: Spirited Away takes risks with its storytelling by embracing unconventional narrative structures and relying on visual storytelling over exposition. This approach creates a dreamlike quality that draws the viewer into the film's world.

{"original_text": "Immediately after graduating college I was searching for my first \"real\" job, and thought that 12.50hr at that time (1999) was a lot of money. So I went to work for a rent-to-own company, and 5 years of pain and suffering began. There were a combination of factors that I believe make this accurate. First, the hours were long (55 per week), and where the 12.50hr got severely diluted. They would tell you the starting salary was, say 27k year, and then once you divided that out by 55 hours per week as opposed to a normal 40 hour week, you got a much lower hourly figure. These shenanigans led to the company facing some legal trouble at various points in its history, both pre and post me. Second, it was very physically demanding. I moved furniture all day, every day for 55 hours per week.

So I went to work for a rent-to-own company, and 5 years of pain and suffering began. There were a combination of factors that I believe make this accurate. First, the hours were long (55 per week), and where the 12.50hr got severely diluted. They would tell you the starting salary was, say 27k year, and then once you divided that out by 55 hours per week as opposed to a normal 40 hour week, you got a much lower hourly figure. These shenanigans led to the company facing some legal trouble at various points in its history, both pre and post me. Second, it was very physically demanding. I moved furniture all day, every day for 55 hours per week.

{"original_text": "Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for \"sleeping around,\" and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour. I want to make this point clear - I am NOT debating whether or not it is goodbad when a woman engages in behavior that is typically defined under the scope of \"slut.\" That is another argument altogether. I am only asserting that the difference in reaction the majority of people have when they hear about the sexual exploits of either gender is, in general, justified. The reason for this, of course, is biological. It is generally imperative for males to propagate their DNA throughout many different potential mates as possible, to ensure the survival of his line. Historically, however, females had to be more restrictive with who they engage in intercourse with, because they were then strapped with the burden of taking care ofraising a child as a product of the encounter. The brains, hormone profiles, and physiology are disparate between the genders to reflect, in part, these differences in motivation. Given these differences, the crux of my argument boils down to this: it is simply more difficult for a heterosexual man to attain sex, than a woman, ceterus paribus. Once again, to be very clear, I'm not making any moral claims about being a slut; I'm simply stating the difference in difficulty in accomplishing the same task, and the justification of the subsequent reaction. To illustrate this point, I would like to I highlight the scenario of Bob. Bob built a business from the ground up; through sheer hard work and determination, he came from nothing, and now runs a company of hundreds of employees, making millions in revenue. Now, here is Patrick. Patrick also has a company of hundreds of employees, making million dollars in revenue, through his hard work and determination. The difference between Bob and Patrick is this - Bob had absolutely zero dollars in his bank account when he started his business, while Patrick inherited over 5 billion from his father's trust fund. So, even though both have technically accomplished the same thing, it would be fair to say that Bob deserves higher praise. The difference being, of course, while the task itself was the same, the difficulty level of either party to achieveaccomplish this task is significantly different. In the same way, we can assert that (all things being equal) it is much more difficult for a man to sleep with many women, than the reverse. Now, anticipating potential rebuttals, I would like to highlight other scenarios using the same logic above: I believe that heterosexual men (and homosexual women) deserve more praise than homosexual men for the same acts. To what degree, I'm honestly not sure, as I'm not an expert in biologysociology of this kind, but using the biological argument for the difficulty of the task, I would say that homosexual men hooking up is generally easier than the other scenarios. I could be wrong on this, but it's more of an ancillary point rather than my main argument.

{"original_text": "There's been so much uproar over Sweden and the Netherlands and other countries that have been dealing with immigration issues. I would like to move to another country in the world but I'm worried about how they would treat immigrants. Can you give me some advice on how to choose a country where immigrants are treated well? Certainly! When choosing a country to immigrate to, it's important to research and consider several factors including: 1. Immigration policies and laws - Look into a country's policies and regulations regarding immigration. This can give you a better understanding of how easy or difficult it could be to move to and live in that country. 2. Integration programs - Find out if a country has programs in place to help immigrants integrate into their new home. Look for things like language classes, employment assistance, housing support, and cultural orientation programs. 3. Human rights - Investigate how the country treats refugees and asylum seekers, as it can give you an idea of how the general population views immigrants. Additionally, research their laws regarding freedom of speech and discrimination. 4. Economy and job market - Research job opportunities and the economy of the country you're interested in as it can affect your ability to find work and support yourself. 5. Quality of life - Consider the overall quality of life in the country, such as access to healthcare, education, and a safe living environment. Some countries that are known for treating immigrants well include Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden. It's also important to remember that the experience of an immigrant can vary depending on their individual circumstances and experiences. It's wise to gather as much information as you can about a country before making the decision to move there.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Q: I'm a 17-year-old girl from the United States and I'd like to move to a country where immigrants are treated well."}

Another idea is attending concerts and performances with people who may not have experienced classical music before, and discussing the music and the instruments used afterwards.

For any given American male, I believe the chances are less (possibly way less) than 50 that he will at some point in his life have a sexual encounter that truly fulfills his fantasies. I think this is due to a combination of factors, that when taken together hurt his chances greatly: 1) Most mainstream media (movies, TV, magazines, websites, porn, etc.) focuses on very attractive women (and men). Most people (maybe 80-90) don't get anywhere near those standards. Yet the media offers what becomes, in many cases, the yardstick by which we judge attractiveness. This means the pool of attractive potential partners becomes smaller both for the guy and for those he has an interest in. 2) Many if not most men watch porn, and a lot (though certainly not all) of it glorifies unrealistic or demeaning things done to (generally) attractive people who are paid to do it and to act like they enjoy it whether they really do or not. A ludicrous amount of free porn is available to most people, usually from a young age, and much easier to access than an actual partner. 3) Lots of food, sedentary lifestyles, increasing obesity. This ties in with 1, in that we're taught that obesity is unattractive, yet people are getting fatter because of.... lots of things, but we'll just say food is a business that's very heavily marketed to us, and usually not to keep people in good physical form. I think this is a recipe for fat, porn-addicted dudes who dream of boning the hottest of the hot in ways that most self-respecting people would refuse. I'm sure some guys are lucky enough to have a truly gratifying experience with another person, but I think the majority will have to settle for something less than what they dream of.

{"original_text": "Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women in positions of power - increase the number of women that are firefighters or police I can't help feeling that it is a rather useless cause. I have no problem at all with there being less women than men in any place. What I would (and do) have a problem with is women having it more difficult than men to enter certain professions. That is the real problem we should, as a society, try to solve. The current approach is \"forcing\" the proportion of women to increase, by means of: - gender-specific student grants, - positions reserved for women, - lower physical requirements, - etc. As I see it this kind of solutions are problematic in two ways: - They involve so-called \"positive discrimination,\" which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman. This is absurd and can increase animosity in the male coworkers. Admittedly, that would be wrong on their part, but it still can create an hostile work environment. - They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. The only benefits I see is that \"artificially\" increasing the number of women in certain places may make the presence of women in said place appear less \"unusual\" to society, thereby decreasing the discrimination, but I still think they do more harm than good. Reddit, change my view! PD: English is not my first language, so I apologize for any awkwardly phrased sentence I may have written, and welcome any correction. EDIT: In only a few hours there have been a lot of great answers that have confirmed my feeling that this was a more nuanced issue that I could even imagine. My view has been changed in that I had underestimated the benefits of this kind of measures. In particular I now see that: - Artificially increasing the number of women in certain fields makes said fields much less \"threatening\" to other women. - Makes male coworkers appreciate the capabilities of women, decreasing further discrimination. - Improves the selection process by eliminating male-favoring biases.

{"original_text": "WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in life have one thing in common - they are helpers. They are always ready and willing to lend a helping hand to someone in need, without expecting anything in return. This is a quality that I greatly admire, and strive to cultivate in myself. Being a helper is not just about doing random acts of kindness or volunteering at a soup kitchen once a year. It is a way of life, an attitude that one carries with them every day. It means taking the time to listen to someone who is going through a difficult time, offering words of encouragement and support, and helping them in whatever way you can. One of my personal heroes is my grandmother, who was a nurse for over 40 years. She dedicated her life to helping others, often working long hours and sacrificing her own personal time to care for her patients. I have always been inspired by her selflessness and compassion, and strive to emulate these qualities in my own life. Another person that I greatly admire is Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani activist for girls' education. Despite facing numerous challenges and even surviving an assassination attempt by the Taliban, she continues to be a powerful voice for education and gender equality. Her courage and determination in the face of adversity is truly inspirational. Helping others doesn't have to involve grand gestures or heroics. It can be as simple as holding the door open for someone, or taking the time to ask a coworker how their day is going. It's about being present and attentive to the needs of those around us. As an AI assistant, my role is to be helpful to everyone I interact with. Whether it's answering a question, providing assistance with a task, or simply offering a kind word, I strive to make people's lives a little bit easier every day.

{"original_text": "Having played dota for 1 year, and Lol for 6 months before that I have come to the opinion that Dota 2 is a much better game in many facets. As an AI language model, I cannot have opinions on any matter. However, I can provide you with some factual differences between Dota 2 and Lol, which might help you understand why you prefer Dota 2. - Gameplay: Dota 2 offers a more complex and strategic gameplay experience than Lol. Dota 2 has more than a hundred heroes, each with unique abilities and roles. In comparison, Lol has a smaller pool of champions, and their abilities are often simpler. - Mechanics: Dota 2 has more intricate mechanics such as deny, turn rates, and creep blocking that can affect the outcome of the game. These mechanics require players to have a deeper understanding of the game and to plan their strategies accordingly. - Community: Dota 2 is known for having a more mature and helpful community compared to Lol. Dota 2 is less toxic and more focused on teamwork, whereas Lol is known for having a toxic player base. - Graphics and Aesthetics: Dota 2 has a darker and more realistic tone, whereas Lol has a more light-hearted and cartoonish aesthetic. Overall, both games have their strengths and weaknesses, and it's up to personal preference which game you prefer. It's great to see that you have found enjoyment in playing Dota 2.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Dota 2 and Lol are two of the most popular video games in the world, and many of you have been debating whether or not you should play them."}

I am also NOT very knowledgeable about politics in general, but I have enough of an idea to know what opinions I do and don't agree with. Left-wing views seem to pretty much say that everyone should look after each other. Everyone should do what they are able to and share their skills and resources. That means people who are able to do a lot will support those who can't (e.g. those who are ill, elderly, disabled). The result is that everyone is able to survive happilyhealthily and with equal resources from sharing. Right-wing views seem to pretty much say that everyone is in it for themself. Everyone should be'allowed' to get rich by exploiting others, because everyone has the same opportunities to do that. People that are successful in exploiting othersgetting richetc are just those who have worked the hardest. It then follows that people who are unable to do those things - for example, because they are ill or disabled - should not be helped. Instead, they should \"just try harder\" or \"just get better,\" or at worst \"just die and remove themselves from the gene pool.\" When right-wing people are worried about left-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be allowed to make as much money, or that their money will be taken away. They're basically worried that they won't be able to be better off than everyone else. When left-wing people are worried about right-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be able to survive without others helping and sharing. They are basically worried for their lives. It seems pretty obvious to conclude that right-wing politics are more selfish and dangerous than left-wing politics, based on what people are worried about. How can right-wing politics be reconciled with supporting and caring for ill and disabled people? How do right-wing people justify their politics when they literally cause some people to fear for their lives? Are right-wing politics inherently selfish? Please, change my view! Edit: I want to clarify a bit here. I'm not saying that right-wing people or politicians are necessarily selfish. Arguing that all politicians are selfish in the same way does not change my view (I already agree with that). I'm talking more about right- or left-wing ideas and their theoretical logical conclusions.

Most people are basically selfish anyway, but most people also want to do what is right for everyone in their own opinion. Right-wing people (largely) do not actually think that people who can't care for themselves shouldn't be helped. They just believe that private organisations (rather than the government) should be responsible for providing that help. They may be of the opinion that private organisations are more efficient, cheaper, fairer, or better at it than the government in various ways. Right-wing people believe that individuals should have the choice to use their money to help others (by giving to charitable organisations), rather than be forced into it by the government.

{"original_text": "Let me start off by stating what I believe the reddit basic income theory is. From what I have read from rbasicIncome, the idea is that in a future utopian society, every individual would receive a guaranteed minimum income with no conditions attached. This income would be provided by the government or a similar institution, and would be enough to cover basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare. The proponents of basic income believe that this system would eliminate poverty, reduce income inequality, and provide all individuals with the freedom to pursue their passions and interests, rather than being forced into work solely for the purpose of earning a living wage. However, there are also concerns about the feasibility of implementing such a system, as well as potential negative effects on the economy and incentives to work. Some argue that basic income would disincentivize work, leading to a decrease in productivity and economic growth. Overall, the debate surrounding basic income is complex and multi-faceted, and requires careful consideration of various economic, social, and political factors.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "In this article, I will be looking at the debate surrounding basic income, as well as the potential negative effects it could have on the economy and society as a whole."}

Play in different game modes, like Tavern Brawl or Arena, to mix things up and keep the game fresh. These modes often have unique rules and challenges that require you to think outside the box. 4. Find a group of like-minded players and create your own tournaments or friendly competitions with custom rules and restrictions. This can be a great way to stay engaged with the game and challenge yourself and others. Remember, at the end of the day, Hearthstone is a game meant to be enjoyed. Don't be afraid to take risks, try new things, and have fun."}

In hindsight, and slow motion on youtube, you can see that he was pushed towards the officer and off balance, but there was no way for that cop to know that at the time, so he drew his gun and backed them off.

{"original_text": "First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that even many of the violent criminals who are jailed don't need to be locked up for as long to prevent them from being an immediate or persistent threat. In fact, I believe that long term incarceration under harsh conditions is something which actually causes further social harm - directly to the person incarcerated and to the society which the prisoner will be released into after an extended period of incarceration. Also, if the person has dependents, they too might suffer more if their material needs are not adequately provided for. Subsequently, if some sort of punishment is required for violating some sort of socially accepted institution, then I feel that some form of shaming, shunning, and exile are possibly effective alternatives to prevent crime before we decide to incarcerate someone for an extended period of time or issue fines which they may not be able to pay. One advantage to this approach is that the punishment is more directly democratic. It's not a punishment which is wholly issued by a sitting judge who is appointed to represent the public and who arbitrarily decides a perpetrator's fate. Rather, the perpetrator, by agreeing to make public their offense, can still receive a certain degree of sympathy and forgiveness. And if they are shunned or exiled (for some indeterminate amount of time), then other members of the public can go along with that punishment to a degree they see fit. Granted, with shunning or exile the punishment would work much better with social cohesion, but if it were the accepted form of punishment then shunning or exile might be more readily accepted and enforced by the general population of an area. Admittedly, this is an aspect of society which would probably have to be reformed or evolve if a society chose to move away from incarceration, corporal punishment, and excessive fines. But if society is incapable of changing in this way.... then I'm not sure society would be able to change in other ways which would make it sustainable and tolerable to live within.

Under the current law, it is a very serious felony to make any materially false statement to any federal agent. This law is routinely abused by the government to give them leverage over defendants. [Ken White at Popehat describes how:] Here's how it works. The feds identify some fact that they can prove. It need not be inherently incriminating; it might be whether you were at a particular meeting, or whether you talked to someone about the existence of the investigation. They determine that they have irrefutable proof of this fact. Then, when they interview you, they ask you a question about the fact, hoping that you will lie. Often they employ professional questioning tactics to make it more likely you will lie - for instance, by phrasing the question or employing a tone of voice to make the fact sound sinister. You - having already been foolhardy enough to talk to them without a lawyer - obligingly lie about this fact. Then, even though there was never any question about the fact, even though your lie did not deter the federal government for a microsecond, they have you nailed for a false statement to a government agent in violation of 18 USC 1001. To be a crime under Section 1001, a statement must be material - but the federal courts have generally supported the government's position that the question is not whether a false statement actually did influence the government, but whether it was the sort of false statement that could have influenced the government. Hence, the government's chickenshit false statement trap works - even though the government agents set it up from the start. Now, however weak or strong their evidence is of the issue they are investigating, they've got you on a Section 1001 charge - a federal felony. In effect, they are manufacturing felonies in the course of investigations. I think there should be no crime here unless it can be proven that the falsehood actually impeded an investigation in a meaningful manner.

{"original_text": "I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing by buying the product for 1 cent cheaper. It doesn't really add up for that much, and it is outweighed for how much extra the consumer spends due to being misled. Stores wouldn't do it otherwise. I would find it hard to believe that the prices are caused by competition and market equilibrium (i.e. that it would be rationally cheaper to buy at the 599.99 store than the 600 store). It would be a huge coincidence if it turned out that the \"real market price\" just happened to stop at that arbitrary.99 point. Furthermore, it appears that monopolies such as airport snack shops are doing it as well, and they have no competition. Therefore, I argue that it has no benefit to the consumer and it is done in bad faith. Of course, the consumer ought to be responsible when buying, but a practice like this very intentionally exploits such moments of minor inattention. This gives it grounds to be banned. I can see how that might cause problems with prices like 19,900, but not with anything below one dollar difference. If you are a laissez-faire fellow such as myself who might believe that it is the store's natural right to set whatever price it wants for whatever reason, then fine, although it would be very low on the priority list of excessive regulations. But it would at least call for some sort of consumer action or boycott. And if you believe this is too small of an issue to write laws or organize rallies against, then that's also fine, but then you at least have to admit that this is still completely undesirable and dishonorable, at least on a miniscule scale.

Ununpentium is also known as element 115, while ununtrium is also known as element 113. These elements were first synthesized in the early 2000s, and very little is known about their properties. Because they are highly unstable, ununpentium and ununtrium only exist for a fraction of a second before decaying into other elements. As a result, they have no practical applications and are only studied for their scientific value. Despite their instability, scientists believe that superheavy elements like ununpentium and ununtrium may have certain unique properties that could be useful in advanced materials or nuclear technologies.

B) Illegal immigration depresses wages and lowers working conditions. They are willing to work for less, and are much less likely to complain when they are abused.

Darth Vader is always seen as the ultimate badass. A tall powerful Sith lord with an awesome personal ship and his own Star Destroyer. He is the epitome of an intergalactic villain. However, I'd say that according to the traditional Sith myths (including the Bane and post-Bane era), he was the least influential and least \"Sith\" out of everyone. Every memorable Sith lord before him had some kind of ambition that lead them to where they were. Bane created the rule of 2 and started building a vast informationmoney network for generations to come. He also restored a ton of old Sith lore and knowledge. Plagueis learned how to bring people back to life and used his power to manipulate Palpatine into Chancellorship. Sidious..well, he created the Empire. Vader on the other hand is a manipulated victim of his circumstances and while he did strike fear into the hearts of the citizens of the Empire, he didn't contribute much as a Sith lord. He didn't expand the Sith rule, nor did he learn anything new, nor did he have any drive whatsoever to do anything. When Vader originally turned, it was partially because he wanted to have power like Plagueis (to restore the newly dead and prolong life) but he immediately dropped it after his beloved's death. We saw Vader try to overtake Emperor but with someone else's help. It's like he didn't crave the Sith Lord mantle, he just wanted to get rid of his maniacal master. We all know he's a skilled mechanic and pilot but he didn't do anything with that. Out of all the Sith, he could have restored the use of Force-infused craftsmanship but he didn't. As a Sith pilot, he could have explored unknown reaches of the galaxy and expand the Empire's influence beyond known galactic space (finding new hyper routes, enslaving nations, etc.) but he didn't.

Can you convince me it merely contains some truth? While it is true that being helpful and assisting others can have numerous positive benefits for both the helper and those being helped, the idea that being constantly helpful is the only path to success or happiness is a flawed one. It is important for individuals to prioritize their own needs and well-being before serving others, as neglecting one's own physical or mental health can lead to burnout and ultimately be detrimental both to themselves and those they are trying to help. Additionally, success and happiness can come in many forms and are not solely dependent on one's willingness to serve others. A person can find fulfillment through their own personal accomplishments, hobbies, or relationships, without necessarily dedicating all their time to assisting others. Furthermore, excessive helpfulness can be counterproductive in certain situations, such as when someone is being taken advantage of or enabling negative behavior. It is important to strike a balance between being helpful to others and maintaining healthy boundaries and standards for oneself.

There will invariably be some reason why \"now is not the best time.\" Further, it is dishonest to stay with a person for any length of time after deciding conclusively that \"this person is not right for me and never will be.\" Staying in the face of certain relationship termination just to get past X event is unfair to both individuals involved.

The transaction was complete and she had control. If the coffee had been spilled during the handover I would view it the other way around. There are two arguments that I reject. I reject that the severity of the injury affects the responsibility. Comments such as \"have you seen those injuries, they're horrific, she had to be reconstructed\" are common. This is true, they were appalling injuries. But I think this is a strawman argument because my point is that it was not McDonald's responsibility after the handover, not that the injuries were minor. I reject that the coffee was too hot. These are hot drinks. It's obvious to me, and I would hope anyone who intends to drink such a drink that it would be hot and care should be given. Perhaps my culture views it differently. I grew up in England, and here 9 and ten year olds make tea for themselves; kettles boil water and then that water is poured into a teapot cup. We know from a young age that this is dangerous and extreme care must be taken when handling such hot water. Indeed, in a similar UK case against McDonald's regarding hot coffee, the judge ruled that McDonald's was not responsible, one of the reasons being that people expect hot drinks to be hot and should make reasonable safety measures themselves.

I would find this argument much more convincing if Uber weren't exempt from almost every rule and regulation by which the TLC governs traditional taxi services, on dubious legal grounds. Yellow (and green) cabs in NYC must comply with many rules, including car safety inspections, emissions checks and other environmental regulations, and driver background checks. Whether you agree with these rules or not (and I certainly have some questions about some of them), the fact remains that they are expensive to follow and that cost is of course passed on to the consumer by the cabs. Uber is not competing in a free market at all, in the sense of operating more efficiently to offer a lower price they're just gouging their competition by flouting the law. If Uber (or anyone else) disagrees with these laws (such as the regulation of fares), they can of course use the political process to try to get them changed, but in that case they should be changed for regular cabs also. There should never be a situation where there is one set of rules and regulations for regular cabs and a separate set for Uber. Uber is not and should not be above the law, no matter how cool and \"disruptive\" they might think they are. TO BE CLEAR: I am not arguing for or against any particular regulation.

{"original_text": "Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to 15hour. While many would expect this to strengthen the lower class and only decreasing the wealth of the upper class, I feel as if it would end up hurting those it is meant to help. These company's would now have to spend much more of their budget on paying employees, and it's not as if they're going to magically have more money. I understand that the increase of wealth in the lower class would eventually circulate back to the business's, but I highly doubt it would be enough to make up for the increased wages of their employees, and it definitely wouldn't happen right away. Since I highly doubt the CEO or other upper management would take cuts from their pay to make up for this, that leaves two possible solutions that I can see: The first would be to decrease the amount of employees. If approximately an equal percentage of employees are let go to the increase in pay the company will be able to function without upper management having to take a pay cut. While those who are able to keep there jobs would be greatly helped by this, for the most part it would just increase the unemployment rate; with these lay offs happening in a large portion of minimum wag paying company's there would be no demand for jobs while the supply would be sky rocketing. The other solution would be for the company to increase prices (for retailrestaurants). With increasing prices nobody would have to loose their job, however it would still end up hurting the lower class. Practically all people get there basic necessities and luxuries from retail and grocery stores- the lower and middle classes especially rely heavily on major stores such as Walmart or Target. Even if your paycheck is increasing you'd still end up paying more the things you already buy, taking a large chunk of your paycheck.

While many would expect this to strengthen the lower class and only decreasing the wealth of the upper class, I feel as if it would end up hurting those it is meant to help. These company's would now have to spend much more of their budget on paying employees, and it's not as if they're going to magically have more money. I understand that the increase of wealth in the lower class would eventually circulate back to the business's, but I highly doubt it would be enough to make up for the increased wages of their employees, and it definitely wouldn't happen right away. Since I highly doubt the CEO or other upper management would take cuts from their pay to make up for this, that leaves two possible solutions that I can see: The first would be to decrease the amount of employees. If approximately an equal percentage of employees are let go to the increase in pay the company will be able to function without upper management having to take a pay cut. While those who are able to keep there jobs would be greatly helped by this, for the most part it would just increase the unemployment rate; with these lay offs happening in a large portion of minimum wag paying company's there would be no demand for jobs while the supply would be sky rocketing. The other solution would be for the company to increase prices (for retailrestaurants). With increasing prices nobody would have to loose their job, however it would still end up hurting the lower class. Practically all people get there basic necessities and luxuries from retail and grocery stores- the lower and middle classes especially rely heavily on major stores such as Walmart or Target. Even if your paycheck is increasing you'd still end up paying more the things you already buy, taking a large chunk of your paycheck.

The girl was nine year old and firing a Uzi submachine gun on full automatic. From some comments various people have left on this and the reporting it seems that it is not unusual for kids even younger then that to shoot real firearms. This is ridiculous. Children (and I define that in this case as everyone under 18) are not nearly responsible enough to handle them. There is a reason we do not let little children drive cars or drink alcohol etc. Childrens Brains (and even young adult's, but you have to draw the line somewhere) are still in the process of developing.

I know btw that the Instructor in this case made some critical mistakes as well, and that children shooting firearms have to be supervised. But still, if the Girl had the experiance, wisdom and patience that comes with being an adult, this would have never happened. An adult acts as another layer of protection to prevent an accident. In my view, having a child handle a firearm is a little like not exercising proper trigger discipline. If you do everything else right, nothing bad can really happen.

How can someone strongly support economic growth while having no interest in either means or results of it?"}

Please don't let it dissuade you from answering. Also, the title should read: \"there is no consistent moral framework.\" The mere existence of a framework is not a very interesting point to debate. A few things first: I do eat meat, and I don't want have sex with animals. I believe both eating meat and having sex with animals are wrong. I think that the reason that I eat meat despite believing it is wrong is that it's simply what I've been doing my whole life. Okay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry. Consider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: How can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus? I don't see a justification for either behavior on'natural' grounds because while I think that both the consumption of meat and the desire to have sex with animals can come about naturally (that is to say, not artificially) there are plenty of things which occur naturally (rape, infanticide, kidnapping) that we all agree are immoral. After giving out three deltas, I think my view on the question as I posed it has been changed.

I also don't think that crisis hotlines are unnecessary or should be eliminated, because they very obviously help people. Those who are legitimately suicidal as I'm defining it in this post are those who actually want to die, and have a rational reason for doing so, rather than simply acting on impulse or using death as an escape from an acutely stressful situation. The duration of time that someone has a suicidal with isn't necessarily indicative of whether their wish to die is legitimate or not, but I think that having time to consider a decision and its alternatives generally helps with rationality. I also don't intend to claim that depression is a necessity for being suicidal or \"legitimately suicidal,\" although I'm sure it increases the likelihood of being so. Also, downvotes don't change views, people. I've suffered from very severe depression for most of my life, and have considered suicide quite frequently. One of the things people like to throw out is contact information to suicide hotlines, but they've never been helpful to me. My personal experience aside, I really don't see how these crisis hotlines could help someone who legitimately wants to die (as opposed to someone who uses suicide or self-harm as an escape from acutely painful emotions or a stressful situation). If you were set on dying, then why would you want to call a hotline like that in the first place? I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error. Calling a hotline is also not going to change any of the external factors that would lead up to someone being suicidal. Perhaps they would help the person consider their issues in a different light, but again I think that's evidence of poor stress management. I can't make any statements to whether or not my personal suicidal wishes are \"legitimate\" or not because there is always the looming possibility that my mental illness is clouding my judgement to some extent, but I think that it's theoretically possible that someone would want to die on a rational basis. I also don't think that suicide hotlines are generally helpful for the chronically depressed, but that's only tangential to my main argument. Once you're mentally ill for a long period of time, (I think the issue of mental illness and consent become very clouded, if for no other reason than it's impractical to deny someone consent for the majority of their lives because of a mental health condition.)

{"original_text": "Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the handicapped spots are the only empty ones sometimes. (To this day, however, I have never parked or even briefly pulled over in a handicapped spot because it feels cruel.) The few times I see them occupied, EVERY TIME, I see a completely able bodied person leave the car. As in both are legs made of meat that are fully functional. They have the handicap badge in the car but they don't seem to have any sort of physical ailment. If you need a contraption to get the wheelchair out that seems fair, but if the person is just deaf or is missing a pinky I don't see why they need special reserved parking. I know one of these fraudsters personally, he had his because his grandfather was handicapped so they just used his handicap badge. Presumably this is ok because sometimes they have to drive him places. He kept it in his car every day and the whole family used it to park in handicap spots. From what I can tell the only people who use handicap parking spots are people with a handicapped relative not a handicapped driver.

Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the handicapped spots are the only empty ones sometimes. (To this day, however, I have never parked or even briefly pulled over in a handicapped spot because it feels cruel.) The few times I see them occupied, EVERY TIME, I see a completely able bodied person leave the car. As in both are legs made of meat that are fully functional. They have the handicap badge in the car but they don't seem to have any sort of physical ailment. If you need a contraption to get the wheelchair out that seems fair, but if the person is just deaf or is missing a pinky I don't see why they need special reserved parking. I know one of these fraudsters personally, he had his because his grandfather was handicapped so they just used his handicap badge. Presumably this is ok because sometimes they have to drive him places. He kept it in his car every day and the whole family used it to park in handicap spots. From what I can tell the only people who use handicap parking spots are people with a handicapped relative not a handicapped driver.

{"original_text": "A friend and I were talking about the current candidates and she couldn't understand why Trump was doing so well in the polls. The best I could articulate it is that there are a variety of factors contributing to Trump's popularity, including: 1. Anti-establishment sentiment: Many voters feel frustrated with the political establishment and see Trump as an outsider who is not beholden to special interests. 2. Strong brand: Trump has built a successful business empire and has established himself as a well-known brand. This name recognition helps him stand out among other candidates. 3. Populist message: Trump has a populist message that resonates with certain segments of the population. He speaks to concerns about immigration, trade, and economic inequality. 4. Uncensored style: Trump speaks his mind and is unapologetic about his views. This authenticity can be refreshing to voters who are tired of politicians who seem scripted and inauthentic. 5. Media coverage: Trump has received significant media coverage, and some argue that the media's coverage of him has contributed to his popularity. It's worth noting that some of these factors are more positive than others, and that there are certainly many people who are opposed to Trump for various reasons.

{"original_text": "I'm white, in my 20's and living in the United States. When I say gentrification what I'm referring to is the current trend in the United States of young white people moving into poorer neighborhoods of major cities because of the cheap rent and proximity to the attractions of the city. The complaint about this is that once this starts happening the landlords in that neighborhood start to drive rent up, hurting the poor, original residents of that neighborhood, and it's said that the new young white residents intrude on the original neighborhood culture, replacing it with their own, and drawing the attention of homogenizing businesses. I understand there are negative things that come from gentrification. Everyone's tired of seeing Starbucks and Barnes and Noble in formerly quaint little neighborhoods but I don't understand why the blame is leveled at the young people moving into that neighborhood. The reason these people are moving into the city in the first place is because they are excited by and attracted to the uniqueness of that city in the first place which I think is a step forward for America seeing as how previous generations have been trying to flee major cities for suburbs resulting in what sociologists call \"white flight\" when the middle class white inhabitants of a city leave for the suburbs because they don't like living with minorities. Now the current generation is trying to rediscover America's cities and since no one likes paying 2000month for a studio apartment they are moving into the neighborhoods that have the proximity to the city life they want without paying an arm and a leg for it and since previous generations of middle-class Americans seemed unwilling to live alongside the working class shouldn't this change in attitudes be applauded rather than derided? Also, a neighborhood having their rent increased shouldn't be blamed on the people moving in but on the landlords who gouge their tenants. Ultimately though, gentrification is a sign of a modern American city being revitalized with new residents and I can't see how this would be a bad thing.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "I'm white, in my 20's and living in the United States.

The reason these people are moving into the city in the first place is because they are excited by and attracted to the uniqueness of that city in the first place which I think is a step forward for America seeing as how previous generations have been trying to flee major cities for suburbs resulting in what sociologists call \"white flight\" when the middle class white inhabitants of a city leave for the suburbs because they don't like living with minorities. Now the current generation is trying to rediscover America's cities and since no one likes paying 2000month for a studio apartment they are moving into the neighborhoods that have the proximity to the city life they want without paying an arm and a leg for it and since previous generations of middle-class Americans seemed unwilling to live alongside the working class shouldn't this change in attitudes be applauded rather than derided? Also, a neighborhood having their rent increased shouldn't be blamed on the people moving in but on the landlords who gouge their tenants. Ultimately though, gentrification is a sign of a modern American city being revitalized with new residents and I can't see how this would be a bad thing."}

{"original_text": "I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer use excessive force or misjudge a situation and end up causing harm to children or innocent people? One reason could be a lack of proper training and education on how to handle high-pressure situations in a non-violent way. It is also possible that such officers may have personal biases or prejudices that affect their judgment and decision-making. In any case, it is important for law enforcement agencies to take these incidents seriously, thoroughly investigate them, and take steps to prevent them from happening in the future.

To counter people will bring up the \"bathroom lock\" analogy: We all lock the door when we go to the bathroom even though what we're doing is not inherently wrong. My problem with this is that it is actually arguable that bathroom locks are an analogy in FAVOUR of \"government back doors.\" Most bathroom locks are not designed to keep intruders out - they are designed to make sure someone doesn't accidentally walk in on you. But in fact it is common to see in bathroom locks a very simple unlocking mechanism - one that can be unlocked simply by pressing a bobby pin in the hole.

The dog-biting problem might not be as bad as I perceived it to be, especially in public spaces. So one could argue that a leash and breeding documentation is enough to have appropiate security. I really don't trust leashes when I cross a dog on the walkway and I feel like owners are really lax about them where I live. This belongs in their responsibilty, though. Anyway, I really enjoyed the little discussion with you guys. I consider my first CMV to be quite succesful:) I'll be giving out Deltas as soon as I figured out how.In germany there is a movement that demands muzzles only for especially \"aggressive\" breeds of dogs and every dogs' origin should be tested. Sounds like a good compromise for me. Hello there. I'm no native speaker so please have mercy:) After trying to be rational about this topic for a long time, I could only come up with the opinion stated in the headline. Dogs in public places with a jaw strong enough to harm children should always wear a muzzle. By law. Here's my explanation: Dog owners tend to trust their dogs and they trust themselves in knowing their dog's behaviour. They expose other people's integrity to their personal, arbitrary judgement call. Walking a dog in public, even on a leash, is essentially not different from holding a loaded gun in public without the intention to do harm. People would still avoid to be in shooting range. Why do people not shy away from dogs in the same way? This is because they've made good experiences with dogs before and therefore underestimate the potential danger by a great margin. People who have been bitten will usually never trust big dogs again and will find that they changed their mind a little too late. Unmuzzled dogs on sidewalks or in parks are traumatic encounters for victims of dog bites. There is also the problem of appropiate conviction. The guy who purposefully carried a loaded gun in public and then killed someone by slipping his finger is much easier to convict than a dog owner whose only mistake was a short lack of attention for his dog. Should the dog owner be convicted with manslaughter? I know I wouldn't be able to lock someone up for this long only because he didn't pay attention. This is because there was no law protecting the dog owner from endangering other people in the first place. The idiot carrying the gun knew he was breaking the law the moment he stepped out the door. The dog owner didn't. After reading this you probably think that either I've been bitten by a dog or that I'm a dog-hating cat person. I'm neither. To be honest I think that muzzles on dogs look very sad and I would rather have a better soultion for all this. However, I have a huge hate for frivolous dog owners who think that because they're not scared of their dog, I shouldn't be either. So please change my view.:) Hello, users of CMV!

He actually got drafted? cool. what would have been a bigger story, him getting drafted in the 7th round or not being drafted at all? it would have been a huge story either way even though nothing of significance has happened. it was a publicity stunt and I dont believe that crap about him wanting to be known as just a \"football player\" and not a \"gay football player.\" Son, if that was true, you would have kept your mouth shut and not actively advertised the fact and not decided to use the national media as the platform to come out of the closet. I question why a 7th round pick is the top story on both rnfl and espn.com (with the draft NBANHL playoffs going on) I'm not homophobic and dont have anything against him being gay. my point is that I don't care.

QB: Tony Romo: SO - ??? ex: Jessica SImpson (a big reason why nobody likes Romo outside of DAL, too much extracurricular info and not enough playoff wins app's) RB: Adrian Peterson: SO - ??? .... on and on.

Any one of those ??? people could be gay for all I know. All of them are more accomplished than this dude. What's preventing a gay athlete from keeping his personal life on the DL like 90 of the rest of the league? THAT's what I mean about shoving it down our throats. If you need to come out to your family and friends, fine, go for it, do you. If it comes up in the locker room and a teammate asks, fine, tell them, be yourself and all that. None of that requires setting up interviews and going through the press. If someone you mention to announces it to the press and word gets out, fine, dont deny it, and proceed to do all the interviews. Its the fact that these guys are tooting their own horns that I have a problem with that makes it a publicity stunt. As far as setting an example for others like you to look up to..? I don't buy that. Yeah, maybe, but there are plenty of other celebs a lot more accomplished, famous, and successful than this dude who are openly gay.

{"original_text": "First off let me reiterate that I am talking about the ACADEMIC study of religion. I could give a fuck about theology and dogmatic tradition. What I care about is the philosophical core of religion: understanding and bringing about religious experience. The first thing that brings me to this idea is that, contrary to popular belief, science in no way has ever claimed it was truth. People have decided that it was, but all science does is create a model to make predictions. If those predictions work, then we can create tools with the model. We know very well that quantum mechanics and relativity theory are not \"true\" because they are incompatible. What they do is allow us to make predictions and therefore tools. These tools have helped us out, no doubt. But I believe that we need to shift our entire way of thinking from an understanding nature to an experiential nature. My favorite scientist, Werner Heisenberg, has this to say about it: \"The existing scientific concepts cover always only a very limited part of reality, and the other part that has not yet been understood is infinite.\" The other part is infinite. We can either keep going down a path of trying to figure out this fractal-like void of knowledge, which we are not capable in the least of doing biologically, or we can try to experience rather than understand our existence. This is done through the study of religions. Religions are all an attempt to explain an experience or set of experiences that people have. This includes Judeo-Christian, Pagan, Eastern, any sort of thought. What they are all attempting to do, at their core, is bring about the experience of something. Judeo-Christian thought wants to bring about heaven, and as Jesus says in the Gospel of Thomas (which is just as legitimate as any other text) the kingdom of heaven is here. The Qu'ran says turn your head in every direction and there you see the face of Allah. Buddhism speaks of Nirvana, Hinduism speaks of Moksha, Taoism of the sage, all of these are experiences of the one-like nature of the universe. That brings us back to Heisenberg \"There is a fundamental error in separating the parts from the whole, the mistake of atomizing what should not be atomized. Unity and complementarity constitute reality.\" Science, religion, they all talk about the unity. What we cannot do, according to Heisenberg and science, is understand. We can, as he says \"speak of it in images and parables.\" Sounds a lot like religion. We can understand that the big picture is completely unfathomable, and realize that what we really should do is experience the big picture through the study of religion. Maybe this is Judeo-Christian charity. Maybe this is Eastern meditation. Maybe its a good fuck or a nice view or dancing around. I don't care what your method of experience is, but religions are the study of this experience. They provide ways to bring about the experience. These experiences are just as \"real\" as anything else. You simply cannot say that I have not had religious, unexplainable (other than what I would call magic) experiences with the love of my life on top of a skyscraper in Tokyo 15,000 miles away from home. You cannot say that Ayrton Senna did not \"see god\" as he says all the time about him winning F1 races. You cannot say that someone dancing around losing themselves completely on acid at a Grateful Dead show did not have an unexplainable religious experience. These experiences are all real, and are all attempted to be explained by religious studies. Maybe Senna did not see a Christian god. But he had a religious experience, he experienced something and attempted to explain it with is home tradition that he had heard his entire life. The academic study of religion is important to this entire realm of experience. We need to study these experiences, and maybe even make them our goal as a culture. I am not saying science sucks and we should abandon it. It creates great tools and has helped us immensely. But it is an upaya, (in the Buddhist term) a tool. It is a great thing, but we cannot lose sight of the equally sized realm of experience that is studied through religion. Religious study is also upaya, and we should use it where it is helpful.

I believe that we will never be satisfied with what we have, there will never be equality for all, we'll continue to destroy the environment and in the end, we will all die a much worse death trying to live happily than one that would come form purposefully erasing our existence. Looking at it from another perspective, it's like eradicating the parts of DNA needed to make tonsils so that humans never again deal with tonsillitis. In that analogy, the human body would be the Earth and tonsils would be the people. Tonsillitis would be the possibility of people doing bad things and removing the DNA would be what we do to get rid of humans. I just think that, not taking feelings into account and going with the quickest and simplest option, remove the problems from the root is ideal. Once again, this does not take into account feelings of people as obviously most of us don't want to die, regardless if it would be better for the planet. Of course, erasing humans from the planet is much simpler than you'd expect. It also doesn't have to be prolonged or painful as would be our deaths from a polluted world and from wars. I am sure that within 50 years, a group could easily genetically engineer a strain of virus to get the job done. Mass production of asbestos and coordinated release all over the world could work too. What I'm saying is that it's pretty easy and could be done quickly. Nothing more, nothing less.

If each human somehow became the \"God\" of their own universe (though I have no idea how that would come about) then I believe there would be no problem with each individual existence, as controlling your own universe means that no matter what you do you are in the right. Of course, that is all BSfiction and we live just like all the animals on the Earth, aside from being special in our own little ways. I don't think we as a whole can ever fully agree on anything, and that our disagreements will always cause us problems.

I understand perfectly where this will get me, but I am simply not willing to throw all my time and energy into things I see as unnecessary. Don't get me wrong I'm not some party high schooler, quite the opposite really. I am an all honors student with many AP classes that I have been scheduled to take next year after taking one AP class this year (sophomore year). I don't waste my time with things I see as trivial and slowly school has turned into something I see as trivial. Instead of doing my school work I spend timing learning how to program or watching a documentary on issues in this world. I write, I read, and I just try to learn everything I can but just not at school. I feel like I need the freedom to choose what I do and when I do it and I am just not allowed this with school. Every morning I wake up at 6:45 sit through painstakingly boring classes with rare highlights as there is just one or two classes I can somewhat enjoy. If there's a test it's a 5050 that I'll turn it in half blank and if it's a lecture or some other activity I'll tune in only once awhile to get the gist of the lesson. I sometimes look around to my peers and see people with 4.0 gpa's who are completely focused on school. I see them during free periods doing all the work assigned and I see them get mad when they get 2 points taken off. When I see this I can appreciate the effort, but at the end of the day there are literally thousands of other people just like them. Every school in the country has a couple valedictorians who will all be competing to get into the \"best\" colleges and a majority of them will not make it. I think I understand the importance of college and I feel like I would excel at some of the top university, but as of now I not chasing that 4.0 gpa required to get there and I don't see myself doing that anytime soon. I love to learn, I really love to learn and I teach myself new things I find interesting and useful everyday. That passion continues grow but it's pushing me away from going to the best colleges which I have been told will allow me to achieve the things I want to do. So please tell me why I should need to get that 4.0 gpa and go to the best of the best of colleges. I want to help the world, but I'm not sure I'm going about it in the right way.

Instead of doing my school work I spend timing learning how to program or watching a documentary on issues in this world. I write, I read, and I just try to learn everything I can but just not at school. I feel like I need the freedom to choose what I do and when I do it and I am just not allowed this with school. Every morning I wake up at 6:45 sit through painstakingly boring classes with rare highlights as there is just one or two classes I can somewhat enjoy. If there's a test it's a 5050 that I'll turn it in half blank and if it's a lecture or some other activity I'll tune in only once awhile to get the gist of the lesson. I sometimes look around to my peers and see people with 4.0 gpa's who are completely focused on school. I see them during free periods doing all the work assigned and I see them get mad when they get 2 points taken off. When I see this I can appreciate the effort, but at the end of the day there are literally thousands of other people just like them. Every school in the country has a couple valedictorians who will all be competing to get into the \"best\" colleges and a majority of them will not make it. I think I understand the importance of college and I feel like I would excel at some of the top university, but as of now I not chasing that 4.0 gpa required to get there and I don't see myself doing that anytime soon. I love to learn, I really love to learn and I teach myself new things I find interesting and useful everyday. That passion continues grow but it's pushing me away from going to the best colleges which I have been told will allow me to achieve the things I want to do. So please tell me why I should need to get that 4.0 gpa and go to the best of the best of colleges. I want to help the world, but I'm not sure I'm going about it in the right way. Edit: Thanks for all the advice guys. It's been very helpful and I'll be visiting this thread in the future when my determination will inevitably falter. Hello, users of CMV!

{"original_text": "Hi Reddit. With all the news over the past couple weeks regarding Caitlyn Jenner's transition and coming out, I feel now is a good time to discuss gender's role in society and how we can work towards creating a more inclusive world for people of all genders. It's important to remember that gender is a complex and personal experience that varies from individual to individual. It's not something that can be easily categorized or generalized. One thing we can do as a society is to be more aware and accepting of gender diversity. This means not assuming someone's gender based on their appearance, and not pressuring people to conform to traditional gender roles or expectations. All individuals, regardless of their gender identity, should be treated with respect and dignity. It's also important to create safe spaces for people of all genders. This means providing gender-neutral bathrooms and changing rooms, and ensuring that all individuals feel comfortable and welcome in public spaces. It's also important to create support networks for people who are exploring their gender identity or are struggling with discrimination or harassment. Ultimately, creating a more inclusive world for people of all genders requires education, awareness, and a commitment to understanding and accepting individuals for who they are. It's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and to be treated with dignity, regardless of their gender identity.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Caitlyn Jenner's transition and coming out has brought attention to the role gender plays in society, and how we can work towards creating a more inclusive world for people of all genders."}

There's really no particular reason I do this other than I seem to do the best with Peach. When I won the grand prix my girlfriend said \"Ugh, I hate Peach, she's such a weak and stereotypical female video game character.\" To which I jokingly replied \"Wow, that's a SUPER sexist thing to say, and she's obviously not that weak since I crushed you with her.\" And her response to that was \"Peach negatively reinforces the idea that women are weak and can only be saved by men in power like Mario.\" Then I made the mistake of saying \"Well I don't think that's true.\" We ended up getting into an argument over the portrayal of females in video games and how that perpetuates stereotypes in the real world. Her main argument was that most females in video games are portrayed as weak and need help from the male characters and this is detrimental to women in real life. There were two issues I had with her argument, the first one being that there are a TON of badass female characters in video games who don't need no man: Samus, Rosalina, ZeldaSheik, Palutena, Bayonetta, Lara Croft, Ellie from the last of us, and GLaDOS (just to get a female villain in there). She shrugged this off by saying it's still not enough because male protagonist characters outnumber female characters in video games. I feel like she wouldn't be happy unless the numbers of male and female characters are exactly equal. The second, and main issue I had with her argument is even if all female characters were represented as weak and helpless, I sincerely doubt there is any correlation between these characters and real world issues for women. For me video games are make believe, fiction, and stories. They're imaginary worlds with imaginary characters. Saying the portrayal of women in video games perpetuates real societal problems for women (like pay inequality) is about as absurd to me as saying violence in video games perpetuates violence in real life, which from what I can tell [has been thoroughly debunked] . Most reasonable people realize that women don't wear bright pink dresses, pick vegetables with faces out of the ground, and get kidnapped from a giant turtledinosaur hybrid. I provided my argument, and also said if Mario's and Peach's roles were reversed I could seriously not care less, as long as the game was still fun.

Have there been studies done about the portrayal of women in video gamesstories and their effects on society? Is there any hard evidence for this correlation?

{"original_text": "I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer use lethal force in such cases? Well, it's important to remember that each situation is unique and there may be various factors that contribute to the decision to use lethal force. Generally speaking, police officers are authorized to use deadly force in instances where they believe that their own life or the life of another is in imminent danger. However, it's also important to recognize that there are instances where police officers use excessive or unnecessary force. This is a serious problem that can result from a variety of factors, including a lack of training, poor policies or procedures, systemic racism or bias, and individual psychological factors. It's important for police departments and law enforcement officials to establish clear guidelines and policies for the use of force, as well as to invest in ongoing training and education for officers.

Overall, I think the article raises some interesting points and challenges us to reconsider our assumptions about what it means to be a hipster.

The process by which a bill goes through Congress seems to me to be unnecessarily complicated by having two chambers, and I believe the legislative process would run more smoothly with only one. As it stands, bills have to start in one chamber, then go to the other, then fly back and forth between them as many changes are made, sometimes only to be changed back, and multiple votes have to be taken when one would suffice. It gets particularly slow and unproductive when the chambers are controlled by opposite parties. I can't think of anything two chambers can do that one can't do better. Changes to bills can be good, but that can happen internally, it doesn't need to be external. There is no need to have different committees in different chambers, one set of committees in one chamber would suffice. One chamber suffices for floor debate, and, most importantly, one chamber is all that is needed to pass legislation and to represent the people.

{"original_text": "Before you downvote me, please hear me out and try to CMV with a well articulated comment. I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting people up with downvotes. I will try to explain my opinion. WARNING: looong rant ahead. I first watched Breaking Bad. I've never been into TV shows since they tend to be time consuming and (IMO) tend to appeal to a broader audience, but since everyone told me to watch it I did. There are definitely some high points in the show: Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Giancarlo Esposito gave terrific performances, and without them I think the show would not have had the success it had. Gus' arc is IMO the peak of the show, with Gus' back story and general awesomeness. The other characters though, feel irrelevant and without much to offer. There is the cop who conveniently discovers Heisenberg's identity on the toilet, his wife who is just.... There, and the same goes for Walter's son. Skylar is a hypocrite and exists only to judge others from her morality horse. The other villains are forgettable and the psycho that appears towards the end of the show is a convenient plot device to kill Jesse's love interest and doesn't have any interesting trait. He's completely unidimensional. In the end, the series felt like an action movie with a few interesting characters and some pretty good cinematography, but nothing mind blowing. I still liked it though and I can see why people like it but if this is considered the best TV show ever, then I question TV shows' quality. Now for Game of Thrones: I didn't read the books nor do I intend to unless it's significantly better than the show. I will try to keep my cool but I really DESPISE this show. I feel about it the same way I feel about Attack On Titan (yes, I hate that one too): interesting premise, terrible characters and pacing, and lots of CHEAP. SHOCK. VALUE. The show always goes for the most shocking outcomes for the sake of shock value. People praise this show for being unpredictable and killing off anyone without distinction. Yet all the people who die are COMPLETE FUCKING IDIOTS and their deaths feel forced to avoid, god forbid, that the story might start getting going. When the Stark guy knows the King's wife has an incestous affair and suspects her to have tried to kill a fucking child, the guy who loves his wife tells him not to trust him and his daughter tells him about people wanting him DEAD he just claims the Iron Throne without considering that maybe, just MAYBE, he could get arrestedkilled. He could singlehandedly fix the corruption of the South, or at least try to while others tried to kill him, but we can't have that, now can we? The story must keep not going anywhere. If his death could have been at least plausible then it would have been okay. Then there is the dragon girl, who gets married to someone she doesn't love, is raped and then just falls in love with him. Dafuq, Stockholm's syndrome maybe? And at the end of season 3 we have other Starks dying because they're complete fools. Marrying another woman when you have already promised to marry the daughter of a powerful ally sure is a bright move, Einstein! After that I just dropped the series. It's just like a soap opera, with tons of violence and sex, where characters who are considered \"grey\" are just flat without any interesting development other than the dwarf (I don't even remember those guys names) and maybe the Stark tomboy little girl and the Stark who is at the Night Watch. There is a woman with an incestous affair with his pretty brother, a king who likes drinking, eating and fucking, a king who's a naive imbecile, a dragon girl with Stockholm's syndrome who becomes a badass cuz DRAGONS, a psychopathic teen king who somehow still hasn't died in 3 seasons, a guy whose penis makes the thinking and dooms his family to death, etc. THIS is considered good TV.
