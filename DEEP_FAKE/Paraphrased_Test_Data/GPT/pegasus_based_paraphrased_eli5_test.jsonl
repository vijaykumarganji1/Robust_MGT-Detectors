As originally conceived by Churchill (yes that Churchill) and his counterparts in the Navy, Gallipoli involved exactly zero ground troops. It was intended as a purely naval operation to force Turkey out of World War I and open up a new supply route to Russia. However, as the planning progressed, it became clear that the naval element would not be sufficient and that land forces would be necessary to achieve the objectives. This necessitated a major change in the scope of the operation and the deployment of troops. Unfortunately, the tactics employed by the Allied forces in Gallipoli were outdated and ill-suited to the realities of 20th-century warfare. The attack was launched with a massive frontal assault, relying on infantry charges and naval bombardment to soften up the Turkish defenses. This approach proved ineffective against the modern technologies and tactics employed by the Turkish defenders, who were able to inflict heavy casualties on the advancing Allied troops. Despite these challenges, the Allies persisted in their efforts, committing more troops and resources to the operation. However, the campaign ultimately failed to achieve its objectives, costing the lives of thousands of Allied troops and damaging the credibility of Churchill and his allies in the process.

{"original_text": "The Americas, Australia, and South Africa were colonized by Europeans. A lot of them went to those lands and established permanent residences there with the intention of having their families live there forever (or at least a long time). In India, the Middle East, and most of the rest of Africa, Europeans just established control for the purposes of extracting resources. Most Europeans went there temporarily to either work or to subjugate native people to work for them. They didn't go with the intention of staying. Since Europeans were living permanently in the Americas, Australia, and South Africa they kept their culture and the nations became Western. Since Europeans didn't really stick around in the other places, the native culture stayed as the predominant culture.,The Americas were basically depopulated when the colonial era dawned, because of the Eurasian diseases that Columbus and his successors brought over. Smallpox, typhus, and the like killed off literally a majority of the population of the Americas before colonists even landed in useful numbers, because the locals had never been exposed to them before and had no immunity. Some estimates go as high as a 90 die-off in the 1500s. This meant that the land was relatively empty, and the political structures that resisted European invaders elsewhere were shattered and ineffectual. As a result of this, and the fact that it was much closer, had more European-like weather, and there were no icky Ottomans in the way, the Americas were colonized earlier. Significant European populations started coming across in the early 1600s, while that didn't happen in Africa until the 1800s. Also, because of all that empty land, the Americas were much more amenable to immigration - vast numbers of poor European farmers came to the Midwest to become well-off farmers in the 19th century, but they only could do that because of policies like \"Show up and you get a quarter of a square mile free and clear.\" No empty land, no farms to give away to European peasants. Also, it's worth noting that Central and South Americans aren't \"white\" for the most part. They're heavily mixed with the natives, and while European culture and language are more dominant, the ethnicity is quite mixed. Brazilians may speak Portugese, but they don't generally look like Portugese people.','Of interest to the poster would also be that Indians are now found throughout the Caribbean and East Africa particularly as they followed British colonists as indentured servants. Hence the upper class in those countries is white, the middle is Indian and the lower classes are the natives.

A lot of them went to those lands and established permanent residences there with the intention of having their families live there forever (or at least a long time). In India, the Middle East, and most of the rest of Africa, Europeans just established control for the purposes of extracting resources. Most Europeans went there temporarily to either work or to subjugate native people to work for them. They didn't go with the intention of staying. Since Europeans were living permanently in the Americas, Australia, and South Africa they kept their culture and the nations became Western. Since Europeans didn't really stick around in the other places, the native culture stayed as the predominant culture.,The Americas were basically depopulated when the colonial era dawned, because of the Eurasian diseases that Columbus and his successors brought over. Smallpox, typhus, and the like killed off literally a majority of the population of the Americas before colonists even landed in useful numbers, because the locals had never been exposed to them before and had no immunity. Some estimates go as high as a 90 die-off in the 1500s. This meant that the land was relatively empty, and the political structures that resisted European invaders elsewhere were shattered and ineffectual. As a result of this, and the fact that it was much closer, had more European-like weather, and there were no icky Ottomans in the way, the Americas were colonized earlier. Significant European populations started coming across in the early 1600s, while that didn't happen in Africa until the 1800s. Also, because of all that empty land, the Americas were much more amenable to immigration - vast numbers of poor European farmers came to the Midwest to become well-off farmers in the 19th century, but they only could do that because of policies like \"Show up and you get a quarter of a square mile free and clear.\" No empty land, no farms to give away to European peasants. Also, it's worth noting that Central and South Americans aren't \"white\" for the most part. They're heavily mixed with the natives, and while European culture and language are more dominant, the ethnicity is quite mixed. Brazilians may speak Portugese, but they don't generally look like Portugese people.','Of interest to the poster would also be that Indians are now found throughout the Caribbean and East Africa particularly as they followed British colonists as indentured servants. Hence the upper class in those countries is white, the middle is Indian and the lower classes are the natives.

The idea of gender, though, a set of personality traits and social roles, is socially constructed. Think of it this way: race is inherited from your parents, but gender is not. (What we call race is actually just a particular set of physical characteristics, but I digress). A black baby is born black, because their parents are black, and they genetically inherit a bunch of physical traits from their parents. The sex, however, is not genetic, but hormonalchromosomal, and doesn't come from the parents. And the gender, boy or girl, is assigned by a doctor after a glance at the genitals. That's why you can't \"identify\" as another race (or age, I guess), but gender is another story.','While I may not be the authority on this, I simply believe that the wiring in the brain did not develop to match the body, according to a video on YouTube that says we are all born female URL2 so it is possible that not all the chromosomes did their jobs leading to anomalies in final \"build.,'Seems like when someone is \"transracial\" they see something in the culture they indenting with which makes sense as to why there's no real evidence about being \"transracial\" even really plausible. I gets like one is embedded in culture and the other has more backup with physiological and psychological standing? Not sure if that made sense.', \"It isn't. Delusion is delusion, mental illness is mental illness. The only real difference is how it is perceived in society, which is based on the politicalsocial climate that we live in. Science and mental healthcare have been put on the backburner for social justice.,\" \"It basically comes to this: for many people sex and gender are not the same thing. while being black or white is a physical matter many would say that gender isn't."}

And also, cartilage leaves very minute traces of their existence in the form of bone shape, and stress points. For an example, look at the skull of an elephant. We can guess just by examining it really closely how much weight the muscles surrounding the skull were supporting, and where a protrusion was likely based on tiny grooves left on the bone near the nose left by muscle. Logically, if such grooves were present in dinosaur bone, we could conclude similar protrusions. Nothing we've found so far seems to suggest cartilaginous protrusions, but that could change with just the right specimen.

You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others' statements without satisfactory proof. You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others.

The differences between viruses and bacteriafungiother things that can make you sick is that viruses are the robots of the germ world. They don't replicate themselves like other life forms do. There are actually a wide class viruses known as bacteriophages which attack other bacteria and use them to make copies of themselves. Basically what a virus does is attack and attach itself to another cell (plant, animal, sometimes has to be specific) and inject its RNA into the cell. That RNA then corrupts the cells normal activity and overhauls it into a virus making factory, which produces the different body parts of a virus, then puts them together to make new viruses. Then depending on whether the virus is of the lytic or lysogenic variety, it either explodes the cell popping the new viruses everywhere, or it goes into a dormant state waiting for different conditions to continue activity. This is how all viruses replicate themselves. Another difference is that viruses can never be fully eliminated from the body the way other diseases can. This is because of the way they replicate themselves. This is opposed to having a bacteria that comes in and divides itself and maybe eats your tissue like gangrene or something. Your body can come in guns blazing, and once the last bacteria cell is killed, its game over. Viruses put their RNA into your normal cells DNA, so whenever your immune system goes down a bit, the virus might pop its head back up. (Think Herpes). So if the virus is in the lysogenic cycle I mentioned earlier, not exploding your cells, then that means whenever your cell replicates itself by mitosis, the viral RNA is also replicated, and you have another potential virus making factory on your hands. It is like a sleeper terrorist cell. To summarize, the distinction you made is a false dichotomy.

In addition to the standard F keys, some telephony systems also support soft keys, which are buttons on a touch-screen display that can be used to activate different functions based on the displayed menu options.

If you are trained, begin by checking the person for responsiveness and breathing. If they are unresponsive and not breathing, begin chest compressions by placing the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest and placing the other hand on top. Push down about two inches and then release, allowing the chest to come back up. Perform 30 compressions followed by giving two breaths, tilting the person's head back and lifting their chin to open their airway. Continue the cycle of compressions and breaths until help arrives or an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available. Always follow the guidance of medical professionals and take a training course in CPR and AED use to ensure proper technique and safety.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "If you or someone you know has suffered a cardiac arrest, here are some tips from the American Heart Association on how to save their life: If you are not a medical professional and are not trained in administering CPR, call emergency services immediately."}
