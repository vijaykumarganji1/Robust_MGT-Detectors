Finally arriving at the cell door, the guard holds on to the meal, as if wishing the inmate's request could still be denied. \" Don't tease me like that. You're like my ex girlfriend \" Chuckled the inmate, his eyes fixed on the glistening patties and molten cheese. \" You know, she's probably married by now, maybe even with kids \" Spoke the guard. The inmate's smile seemed to fade for a moment, but the usual grin returned almost instantly. \" Yeah, I pity the bastard. Now give me my burger \" The inmate gestures, pointing at the tray the guard was still holding. She drops it on the table and shoves it towards the inmate, fries flying everywhere. With a small sneer, she places the lukewarm soda next to the now disheveled cheeseburger. \" Fine. I hope you choke on it you son of a bitch.

The inmate seems to have noticed, and quickly addresses her remark. \" They couldn't come. Told you my sister's smart right? I heard she was in college the last couple years, now has some important job in a firm on the east coast. She's a big shot lawyer now. Not that it would have helped me through .\" The guard's lips twitch, forming a small smile. She stays silent: They both know he's avoiding something. \" You're probably wondering why my brother didn't come \" He mumbles. \" No I- \" \" It's okay \" He says, a bit louder this time. \" The reason he and I fought so much is because we were so similar. A bit too similar actually .\" The inmate looks down at his lap, clutching the fabric of his prison issued uniform. \" He... \" The inmate sounds choked. \" He got mixed up with the wrong crowd. My crowd .\" A tear rolls down the inmate's cheek, and he quickly wipes it away with his sleeve. \" When you live the kind of life we had, there's only two ways out. Prison, or ... \" The inmate doesn't bother finishing his thought, though the meaning was clear. The guard stood rooted in place, staring at the ground. As she finally moved, approaching the inmate with her hand outstretched, another voice was heard behind them. \" It's time \" said the warden. \" I'll go get some guys to escort him \" As the warden leaves, the guard hesitates to approach the inmate. He's silent, lost in his own thoughts. After a few seconds, the guard and the inmate are brought back to reality by the sound of footsteps echoing down the hall. \" I'm sorry \" She whispers. \" It's time \" \" I know. I came to terms with what I did a long time ago, I think I'm ready to leave this place \" The guard notices the untouched burger sitting in front on the inmate. \" You didn't eat \" \" I'm not hungry \" \" But now you'll be able to eat two of your mom's burgers right? \" The guard quips. The inmate smiles, and gets up. Two different guards arrive, and grab him by the arms. As they take him out of the cell, he whispers \" Thank you ,\" too low for anyone else to hear.

The inmate seems to have noticed, and quickly addresses her remark. \" They couldn't come. Told you my sister's smart right? I heard she was in college the last couple years, now has some important job in a firm on the east coast. She's a big shot lawyer now. Not that it would have helped me through .\" The guard's lips twitch, forming a small smile. She stays silent: They both know he's avoiding something. \" You're probably wondering why my brother didn't come \" He mumbles. \" No I- \" \" It's okay \" He says, a bit louder this time. \" The reason he and I fought so much is because we were so similar. A bit too similar actually .\" The inmate looks down at his lap, clutching the fabric of his prison issued uniform. \" He... \" The inmate sounds choked. \" He got mixed up with the wrong crowd. My crowd .\" A tear rolls down the inmate's cheek, and he quickly wipes it away with his sleeve. \" When you live the kind of life we had, there's only two ways out. Prison, or ... \" The inmate doesn't bother finishing his thought, though the meaning was clear. The guard stood rooted in place, staring at the ground. As she finally moved, approaching the inmate with her hand outstretched, another voice was heard behind them. \" It's time \" said the warden. \" I'll go get some guys to escort him \" As the warden leaves, the guard hesitates to approach the inmate. He's silent, lost in his own thoughts. After a few seconds, the guard and the inmate are brought back to reality by the sound of footsteps echoing down the hall. \" I'm sorry \" She whispers. \" It's time \" \" I know. I came to terms with what I did a long time ago, I think I'm ready to leave this place \" The guard notices the untouched burger sitting in front on the inmate. \" You didn't eat \" \" I'm not hungry \" \" But now you'll be able to eat two of your mom's burgers right? \" The guard quips. The inmate smiles, and gets up. Two different guards arrive, and grab him by the arms. As they take him out of the cell, he whispers \" Thank you ,\" too low for anyone else to hear. The ominous footsteps recede, leaving the guard in the silent and empty cell. She grabs the tray, now cold and lifeless, and slowly walks back the way she came.

At the end of those ten minutes, she would learn what the rest of her life would be like. The seconds seemed to slow and it felt like it took hours for a single moment to pass. Angelique's stomach tightened, and she glanced around the room at the party guests. In just ten minutes, it would be 18 years to the second since she was born. And then she would get to be like the rest of her friends and classmates. The young girl, with mahogany hair and tan skin, was the youngest in her class, and quite possibly in her grade at school. Naturally, everyone else had already received their powers. Some people's powers were limited to small'party tricks', such as changing their appearance, and had no significant effect on their surroundings. Some had abilities that made their life easier, such as hovering a couple inches off the ground, allowing them to easily glide down the street. In more extreme cases, students received potentially dangerous powers that required them to see a psychiatrist at least once a month to make sure they could handle the responsibility, or, if they were lucky, they received potentially life-saving powers and were recruited into the NHA, National Heroes Association. A sort of super-natural police force. So far there had been little more then a handful of those people at Angelique's school that year, although she hoped to possibly be added to that small list. Sensing her distress, her friend, Sam, who was lounging on the couch beside her, waved her hand in front of her face, breaking her out of her trance. \" Yoohoo! \" She chirped, giggling. \" Why don't you take your eyes off the clock for a moment? You're not gon na make time fly any faster that way, ya know. \" \" Y-yeah..... ok, sure, \" Angelique stammered. \" So what kind of cake did you get? \" Sam asked, trying to distract her friend. \" Oh, it's red velvet.

I don't think it's really my thing. \" \" Aww, but it's so awesome! \" \" It's kinda creepy, really.

But every now and then she would manage she catch a glimpse of the clock, and recalculated the time she had left. 5 minutes, then 3, 2, 1..... Angelique watched as the seconds ticked down to the final moment, then closed her eyes. The room got quiet. There was only the sound of wind blowing past and the feeling of intense sunlight on her skin. Sunlight? That wasn't right..... even if she was outside, it was a cloudy day, with no sunlight anywhere near her house. Angelique opened her eyes and found herself in the middle of a foreign landscape. A flat, dry, wasteland. There was nothing around her except for dust and rocks. No plant or animal life to be seen. She looked up into a dark blue sky and shielded her eyes from the bright red sun that beat down on her. Within seconds, her skin began to burn, and she struggled to breathe.

How about separating everyone artificially by age and telling them when they can pee or blow their nose? How about asking someone to be creative and then telling them they have to do it a certain way?\" \"You were supposed to write the biography of your respected family member, not a dramatic retelling of their life that changed an unsolved missing person situation into an abduction by aliens.

The Air Force.\" He sighed. \"The Air Force advanced you through their ranks quickly because you were the daughter of one of their darlings, and you demonstrated that you had her intuition and affability. You had a stellar career in store until you exploited every opportunity to sneak into their classified records in order to find evidence of a cover-up.\" \"What you're forgetting is that I did find evidence of a cover-up,\" she argued. \"You found evidence that her plane was found intact and sold to a private buyer in India through the black market. This indicates corruption, but no cover-up, and no aliens, young lady.\" \"Don't dismiss me because of my gender, Dad. I'm not so young and I'm definitely no lady. I also found evidence that they doctored her file after her disappearance to show that she was suffering from post-partum depression.\" \"Maybe it was doctored, or maybe her counselor was just updating the file for completeness.\" \"Five years after her last child was born? Or maybe they didn't want to pay out the insurance by ruling it a suicide.\" \"So now there's more than one conspiracy?\" \"Why can't there be?\" \"Because, Reggie, once you need multiple theories to support your paranoia, it conflicts with Occam's Razor.\" \"Dad, you went along with it because it suits your personal agenda. You didn't want the insurance payout, because it was affirmation that said she was really dead. You loved her and you never wanted that. You wanted to believe that she had post-partum depression, freaked out, shut off communications and flew off to India. You want to think that she never called you because she had a mental breakdown and started a new life.\" \"Whereas you think what, Reggie? Still aliens?\" \"Yes.\" Regina paused for dramatic effect. \"And she's home.\" She threw open the door to the parlor, where Adina sat, flipping through the news on her tablet. \"Did you have fun berating your father, dear?\" she said. \"Very much so.\" \"It's not kind, you know.

A husband, who will be disappointed by my failure to honor my marriage vows? A child who looks at me in pity as one who has been enslaved and abused? My life on Earth is gone, Dex. You have no idea how much joy it gives me to see Regina, tall and strong and healthy, but I have no other reason to stay. On Asphodel, I matter. I'm the woman who united and saved the planet. I'm a general, something I could never have achieved in the Air Force.\" \"Do you know how you inspired me, Mom?\" Regina said. \"You did everything in your power to ensure that we had a good childhood, even as you pursued your career. You taught us about the strength of being a woman in a world that is stacked against us. I can't believe that now you're just the thrall of a dictator.\" Adina pulled herself to her full height. \"Slow down one minute,\" she snapped. \"I'm not a thrall. Maybe I seemed to be, once, when my very survival depended on him, but things change. I direct my own life now. Would I be here now if he had any control over me?\" \"Tell me that you would rather be there on his ugly rock pelted by ugly rocks whose only aim is to pelt more rocks at other planets to turn them into ugly rocks too!\" Adina's lips turned up at that, and despite the tension in the room, both women laughed. \"Regina,\" she said quietly. \"You speak of strength. I can defend myself against almost any physical attack. I resisted the attempts of my kidnapper to break me emotionally, and turned him into my admirer. I command the loyalty of ten thousand troops, I use them as a force for societal change, and I have no issues with making difficult judgment calls and ordering those troops to their death. I do not, however, have the strength wake up every day and look into the eyes of a husband I betrayed.\" \"You're supporting a regime that will destroy Earth,\" Regina said. Adina waved her off. \"He won't destroy Earth. He just wants to unify Earth under the same authoritarian rule that has been so successful on Asphodel.\" \"Are you serious, Mom? You think that he can unite a strange planet, of which he has no understanding of the culture and complexity of international relations, by exporting a kind of government which barely worked on his own world?\" \"For the same reason that a family might see a counselor, Regina, it sometimes helps to have an external, expert point of view. He knows more than you think. He's been observing Earth for decades, after all.\" Regina snorted. Adina sighed. \"Alright. You're probably right. I'll overthrow the bastard.\" She stood up and kissed Regina on the cheek, and neatly stepped over the broken form of her ex-husband as she pressed a button on what looked like the remote starter for a car. A thundering roar shook the house. \"I'll be home by Christmas.\"", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "\"Do you remember that time the school called you to the office about me?\" Regina said. Dex snorted. \"Yeah? Which time?\" \"The time they called me a liar.\" \"Reggie, they were just trying to help you distinguish between fanciful ideas and facts.\" \"I thought that they were trying to give me an education,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, they just wanted me to recite facts and churn out essays spouting the standard dogma.\" Dex sighed. \"Memorization of facts is a part of education too, Regina.\" \"Is it? How about separating everyone artificially by age and telling them when they can pee or blow their nose? How about asking someone to be creative and then telling them they have to do it a certain way?\" \"You were supposed to write the biography of your respected family member, not a dramatic retelling of their life that changed an unsolved missing person situation into an abduction by aliens. You were twelve, and grieving, so we let it slide with just counselling. Nobody ever said you were a liar.\" His voice was rising, and he interrupted himself. \"Reggie, I'm not going to get sucked into another argument with you about this particular trigger point.\" Regina paced back and forth in front of him. \"What about one of my other triggers, as you call it? The Air Force.\" He sighed. \"The Air Force advanced you through their ranks quickly because you were the daughter of one of their darlings, and you demonstrated that you had her intuition and affability. You had a stellar career in store until you exploited every opportunity to sneak into their classified records in order to find evidence of a cover-up.\" \"What you're forgetting is that I did find evidence of a cover-up,\" she argued. \"You found evidence that her plane was found intact and sold to a private buyer in India through the black market. This indicates corruption, but no cover-up, and no aliens, young lady.\" \"Don't dismiss me because of my gender, Dad. I'm not so young and I'm definitely no lady. I also found evidence that they doctored her file after her disappearance to show that she was suffering from post-partum depression.\" \"Maybe it was doctored, or maybe her counselor was just updating the file for completeness.\" \"Five years after her last child was born? Or maybe they didn't want to pay out the insurance by ruling it a suicide.\" \"So now there's more than one conspiracy?\" \"Why can't there be?\" \"Because, Reggie, once you need multiple theories to support your paranoia, it conflicts with Occam's Razor.\" \"Dad, you went along with it because it suits your personal agenda. You didn't want the insurance payout, because it was affirmation that said she was really dead. You loved her and you never wanted that. You wanted to believe that she had post-partum depression, freaked out, shut off communications and flew off to India. You want to think that she never called you because she had a mental breakdown and started a new life.\" \"Whereas you think what, Reggie? Still aliens?\" \"Yes.\" Regina paused for dramatic effect. \"And she's home.\" She threw open the door to the parlor, where Adina sat, flipping through the news on her tablet. \"Did you have fun berating your father, dear?\" she said. \"Very much so.\" \"It's not kind, you know. He's been through a lot.\" Dex walked up to her, staring at her face as if it were a hallucination, then suddenly fell to his knees in front of her. He took her hand and began to cry. \"Dex, please don't. I lost the ability to cry years ago, and it makes me uncomfortable.\" \"Where did you go? Where have you been? My love...\" \"Haven't you been listening to your daughter? I was abducted by an alien armada as they tried to infiltrate Earth.\" \"Are you..... joking?\" \"Not at all. They forced my plane to land over the Marshall Islands, took me captive and forced me to teach them everything I knew about navigation, geography and modern technology. They couldn't leave me here while they regrouped at their home planet to make a battle plan, but the General took a fondness to me, and brought me home to Asphodel as his bride of war.\" Dex's jaw dropped. \"I fought him at first,\" she said quietly, \"but he was an expert at breaking people. I was light years from my family. It was either adapt to my new life, or die. I chose to live.\" \"I don't care. I'm glad you're home to stay, and we're going to make everything alright.\" \"What is here for me? A world that will be disgusted with me for betraying them?

{"original_text": "\"So..... As you all know...\" Mayor Sharda tapped a few papers against the podium. \"We have a slight problem on our hands.\" She was a short and prime woman with nest of blond curly hair on her head. Her makeup was slightly smudged and she had smears of ash on her clothing. The group of individuals she was addressing was a group of middle school children, huddled together in the broken down remains of their auditorium. Most of the school had fallen in disarray since the first attack, but it was one of the few remaining buildings large enough to host many individuals. \"We're going to do a slight recap of events. Some of you are recent additions to our group, as you have had your twelfth birthdays.\" She gave a signal to her assistant, a unicorn named Charlene, and a projection of a tall but cruel looking man appeared behind her. He had a pointy hat and a long beard marred with gray. \"This is High Emperor Wizard Supreme Tim. He emerged from the magical world three years ago and has set about conquering the human race.\" Some of the girls in the audience did a gasp and turned their heads away. Many of the younger ones bit their lips to fight back the tears as the older ones clenched their fists tightly. All of them had lost friends and family to the Malevolent Tim. At first, the media claimed it was a terrorist group out of Germany. That they spread false propaganda of magic to their cult follows. Then it became an argument that they had advanced technology. By the time the world caught on to their true nature, it was far to late to strike up any sort of efficient counter attack. \"The past few years have been harsh, but we believe that our small town of Elizabeth has the answer.\" The image changed behind Mayor Sharda again, this time revealing an old text writen in archaic script. \"When our town was founded, a famous medicine woman declared that a special chosen child will arise from this place any time a great evil threatened the world. Now, more than ever before, is the point where we need to rely on that prophecy. It is quite possible that someone located here will gain the ability to defeat Tim.\" She stared out at the room and let that sink in. The older children were still averting their gaze while some of the younger ones started to look hopeful, mystified by what the mayor was saying. \"Unfontunetely, we do not know exactly how they are chosen. We have sought out different ways, and every time that particular person has unfortunately failed.\" The last child was a boy named William. They threw some old bones in the air and they pointed to him when they fell. He sought to learn magic himself and mastered some limited spells, but was quickly killed off by one of Tim's poltergeist inhabited tanks. Shield spells don't work well against tank shells. Before that was a girl named Adelaide who was chosen due to being born under an astrological event. She was the Chosen One for less than a week when Tim sent a thirty foot tall assassin bug after her. They said it was a slow death. That her screams were heard in the middle of town for hours. It was supposed to be a warning for them not to try again. But try again they did. And now it was time to select a new child in an attempt to stop the Malevolent Tim. \"So like we have many, many times before. We are going to attempt to find our Chosen One. Charlene here will whisk you out of town safely and we can all go back into hiding and fearing every day for our lives.\" The unicorn gave the children a nod as the woman covered her eyes with one hand. The other stretched out a finger and started to point randomly in front of her. \"Eenie, meenie, mineie, moe. Catch a tiger by the toe...\" The older of the group started to shuffle about. They placed younger children in front of themselves or hide behind each other. Some of the younger ones purposely sought out the finger, still thinking that magic was a game. \"If he follows, let him go.\" There were a few who just gave up completely and laid against the floor. \"Eenie, meenie, mineie...\" Mayor Sharda paused. Her finger pointed at a girl who froze in place. There were beads of sweat forming on her forehead as the mayor's posture stiffened. Suddenly her arm flitted over to the right, before anyone could think to dodge it. Her eyes snapped open and she stared hard at the one who she found. As though she were trying to burn the image of them into her memories. It was a tall boy, around fourteen. Tomorrow, he would turn fifteen and would be no longer eligible for selection. Today, he was still very much fourteen and very much chosen to be a hero. \"Moe!\" The mayor cried out, wagging a finger at him. \"It's you! You are the Chosen One!\" The boy rubbed the back of his head and looked around. Everyone else was staring directly at him but he was doing his best to be unimpressed. \"I think she was talking to you.\" He nudged the much shorter boy in front of him with his elbow. \"Better go on stage and work that out.\" \"No! Not him, you! You Roger Perkins! You!\" Mayor Sharda knew the name of every person here. \"No you get on that unicorn right this instant and go work on your destiny!\" \"Ah, well...\" He stepped back and gave a shrug as the unicorn approached. \"You see, that would be kind of difficult. I'm not a virgin, after all. Can't really go riding on...\" Charlene nudged him in the shoulder as he attempted to side step away from her. \" ..... Fine.\" He tossed his arms in the air. \"Just fine! FINE! I'll go fix things!\" \"Now remember, you have until you turn fifteen to stop Wizard Supreme Tim. After that, you would have failed your mission and humanity will be doomed.\" Mayor Sharda frowned and narrowed her eyes. \"I turn fifteen tomorrow.\" He looked over at the clock on the wall, which he quickly realized was broken. \"That means I only have a few hours to do it?!\" \"Thirteen hours and fourty-seven minutes, precisely.\" The mayor nodded. \"It's your fault for not coming forth as the Chosen One sooner.\" She folded her arms and nodded slowly. \"It should be fine, Wizard Supreme Tim has many spies within Elizabeth. He always comes personally to finish off whatever child we pick near Choosing Day. I'm sure that you'll have till well before midnight to figure out how you are going to beat him!\" Roger was going to issue another word of protest but music had already started to play. A farewell tune to all who have become Chosen. \" ..... Fine!\" He patted the unicorns neck and she stooped down so he could prop himself up on her back. \"I'm going to go out there. I'm going to save humanity and dammit I am going to find a girl while I do it. Just to prove you all wrong!\" Charlene reared back and Roger got a look of panic on his face as he struggled to not get tossed off. \"Good luck!\" The children cried out to him as he headed out of the auditorium with a scowl on his face.

{"original_text": "Dear Sir, This letter is to inform you that one Randy Payne, of 530 Linden Lane, Harrisburg PA, has filed a form 839 (y) - Intent to Murder against you on June 24th, 2016. The Intent to Murder has been approved and is valid from your receipt of this letter today until the 31st of September this year. Please review the FAQ section below about what actions you may take should you wish not be murdered. Please also note that our records indicate that you yourself were approved for a form 839 (y) in November of 2015 against one Rachel Payne, which you carried out on the 26th of that month. As you know, this waives your right to self defense should someone attempt to carry out an 839 (y) against you at any time and you will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law for any unapproved killings. For further information regarding this matter, please see the FAQ below, or visit Frequently Asked Questions I do not want to be murdered, what are my options? Many people do not wish to be murdered and seek to evade the intentions of their murderer. This survival instinct is only human, and should not cause alarm. If you wish to prevent your murder, it is recommended that you file a form 839 (y) against your intended murderer and attempt to face them in a duel. Please note that if you have filed a form 839 (y) at any point in the past, you must wait 6 months after the expiration of that form to file a new 839 (y) against a different individual and 1 year to file a new 839 (y) against an individual you have attempted to murder before. In the event that you have filed a form 839 (y) and successfully dispatched your intended victim, you are no longer eligible to commit murder. Can I hide? While you may hide from a murderer, please be advised that there is nothing preventing an intended murderer with a valid form 839 (y) finding you. Some individuals have attempted to flee to foreign countries, with various degrees of success. However, your travel will be recorded by the State Department in a publicly accessible database. If you wish to plan travel to a country that does not honor form 839 (y), please find a list of non-participating sovereign states at What if my murderer is not successful If, for whatever reason, your intended murderer does not fulfill the lethality requirements of form 839 (y) (Section 3.5 - Lethality and brutality of methods,) within the allowed timeframe, they are free to file a new form 839 (y) against you after 1 year has passed. Please note that extraneous and repeated filing of a form 839 (y) against an individual without significant action towards their demise is considered harassment. If you feel that an individual is filing forms 839 (y) against you without actual intent to murder, you may attempt to get a restraining order issued against them. The person who filed against me is an employee, am I within my rights to fire them? You are legally protected from a wrongful dismissal case if an employee has at any time filed a form 839 (y) against you or anyone else associated with your company.

The Intent to Murder has been approved and is valid from your receipt of this letter today until the 31st of September this year. Please review the FAQ section below about what actions you may take should you wish not be murdered. Please also note that our records indicate that you yourself were approved for a form 839 (y) in November of 2015 against one Rachel Payne, which you carried out on the 26th of that month. As you know, this waives your right to self defense should someone attempt to carry out an 839 (y) against you at any time and you will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law for any unapproved killings. For further information regarding this matter, please see the FAQ below, or visit Frequently Asked Questions I do not want to be murdered, what are my options? Many people do not wish to be murdered and seek to evade the intentions of their murderer. This survival instinct is only human, and should not cause alarm. If you wish to prevent your murder, it is recommended that you file a form 839 (y) against your intended murderer and attempt to face them in a duel. Please note that if you have filed a form 839 (y) at any point in the past, you must wait 6 months after the expiration of that form to file a new 839 (y) against a different individual and 1 year to file a new 839 (y) against an individual you have attempted to murder before. In the event that you have filed a form 839 (y) and successfully dispatched your intended victim, you are no longer eligible to commit murder. Can I hide? While you may hide from a murderer, please be advised that there is nothing preventing an intended murderer with a valid form 839 (y) finding you. Some individuals have attempted to flee to foreign countries, with various degrees of success. However, your travel will be recorded by the State Department in a publicly accessible database. If you wish to plan travel to a country that does not honor form 839 (y), please find a list of non-participating sovereign states at What if my murderer is not successful If, for whatever reason, your intended murderer does not fulfill the lethality requirements of form 839 (y) (Section 3.5 - Lethality and brutality of methods,) within the allowed timeframe, they are free to file a new form 839 (y) against you after 1 year has passed. Please note that extraneous and repeated filing of a form 839 (y) against an individual without significant action towards their demise is considered harassment. If you feel that an individual is filing forms 839 (y) against you without actual intent to murder, you may attempt to get a restraining order issued against them. The person who filed against me is an employee, am I within my rights to fire them? You are legally protected from a wrongful dismissal case if an employee has at any time filed a form 839 (y) against you or anyone else associated with your company.

{"original_text": "Jim had drawn the short straw for night shift in the engine room. He would have volunteered if he hadn't. Night shift was nice, the lights were dimmed aboard the ship in the off hours, stem to stern. Captain's orders, it allowed better regulation of circadian rhythms for the rest of the crew and let Jim avoid the dazzling brilliance that passed for \"day\" aboard the cruiser. He supposed it was his fault, born and raised on Sian where the noon time sun was little brighter than a full moon on Earth. The engine hummed softly as Jim performed routine maintenance. The other man on duty was Stuart, about as salty a sailor as Jim had ever seen, with hair that grew only in patches and a scar that ran from jaw to eyebrow beneath an eye patch. Jim was more than a little afraid of Stu. \"Fluid'll need changing\" Jim nearly leaped from his skin. Drawing a shaking breath he responded \"maintenance logs shows it was changed eight hours ago.\" \"Maintenance logs is wrong, then. Changed up the fluid but didn't clean the filter. Always clean the filter. Drain, clean the filter, fill. Not so hard is it?\" \"Er, no...\" Jim checked the dip stick and noted the reactor cyclant was a touch discolored. \"Well tell that to the day shift crew! Filter needs cleaning every time the fluid's changed. You're not like Alston, I can tell. Pompos ass, thinks'cuz he studied engineering he knows how to be an engineer. Well I say if you want clean cyclant you need a clean filter. I know this engine inside and out I do. Come here, I'll show you how to clean the filter. Always use a number two brush, number three's too stiff and if you use a number one you'll be here all shift...\" Jim learned a lot as they worked, and duties finished almost two hours before the end of their shift. Stu sat down on one of the benches and drew out a flask. \"You're a hard worker, Jim, and you listen what I tell you. So now let's talk about the airlocks.\" \"Airlocks?\" Jim asked, taking the proffered flask. It held rum, strong enough to make his eyes water and sweet as candy. \"Aye, the airlocks. You'll use'em now and again, replace ablation plate, drive needs work on the outside, you'll make your way outside from time to time. But it's the airlocks you need to look out for.\" \"What do you mean?\" He took another swig and passed the flask back. \"You're not the first lad in space, Jim, and you certainly won't be the last. There have been others out there, you know, and not all of'em make it back planetside.\" \"You mean to watch out for mechanical failure?\" \"Aye. And turn the lights off when you get back in.\" \"Lights? Why?\" \"There's a story, and old one. I heard it on a night like this when I was your age. You heard of the Machanna?\" \"Sure, heard about it in school, lost to the stars out around Tau 3, it's held up as a prime example of design failure.\" \"Oh aye, coolant had to be jettisoned from outside, had to be done once a week or the reactor'd overheat. Did they tell you in academy why they couldn't? No, I suppose not. That's not a popular story, not sanctioned and all that. Well they gave the job to a new kid, a sort of hazing. Coolant was a gel back then, was real funny to tell the new kid he needed to clean his suit before they could let him back in. Well, they gave the kid the job, and of course he gets the coolant all over himself, no way not to. They tell him he's got ta clean his suit before they let him back in, so he starts to panic, yeah, because he's already low on air. He flails around a bit, loses most of his tools, everything but his number six scraper. The folks inside see him and tell him to stop, but he's not listenin' see, because he things he's got to clean his suit. So he starts at it with the scraper, and you can't clean a suit with a scraper, it just can't be done, and sure as shit the suit gets a puncture. \"Now the boy was in a fuss before, but now he's in a panic. They're shouting over the radio to get inside the airlock, it's good enough, it was just a joke. Finally the kid gets the message, and pulls himself in. He's bleedin air fast and they dump emergency tanks to equalize the pressure inside the airlock. Kid thinks he's safe and pulls off his helmet. He's half blind, sweat in his eyes, out of breath, so he reaches up to open the door, but the airlock's faulty, the outer door blows off, vents the atmosphere in the airlock and takes the kid with it.\" \"Holy shit.\" \"So the crew's watchin him out there. They don't tell you in academy, but vacuum doesn't kill you like they used to think it did. It's a hard death out there, your skin swells up, your eyes get so dry they'll crack, and there's no relief until you suffocate. And suffocate they did, it was a full ten minutes before the boy quit movin. But now they've got a problem,'cuz the kid's still got his tether on. So the crew draws straws to see who'll cut the tether to let him drift free, and it's the first mate that draws the short straw. \"So he suits up, and while he's doing it they lose sight of the body. So the mate, see, he goes to the other airlock, and he's just about to cycle into it when he looks through the window, and standing there's the kid.

{"original_text": "\"Under the aegis of our gods we took to the stars. Under the guidance of the Pearl of Dawn we ranged out and met other species. With the kindness of the Keeper of Hearths we brought them to our fold. Behind the protection of the Sorrowful Matron we defeated their attacks. Under the gaze of the Shrouded Captain we accepted their gods alongside ours. And now, following the light of the Soothing Torch, we will bring glory to our empire.\" It was a common prayer, and Alit spent a few moments meditating on its meaning before getting to his feet and walking out of the Chapel. It was about giving praise to the gods, of course, but not only. It was about trust. The gods had always stood by the Hiloi, from the founding of the First Empire, through the First and Second Interregnums and the Second Empire of today. The prayer was about reaffirming the Hiloi's commitment to the covenant between them and their gods, and most importantly trust that as long as that covenant held, nothing could shake the Empire. Alit made his way to the Emperor Hijraska's bridge, pausing only briefly when he came across the ship's Chaplain to kiss his ceremonial ring. He'd barely taken his station as the bridge's nav officer that Crusader Settn, the Hijraska's XO, appeared, prompting the officers on the bridge to murmur a Psalm of Benediction as naval tradition mandated. Settn's face was grim and his second pair of ears flat against the top of his head - a sure sign of the worry that ate him inside. He gestured to Alit first, then to Densk and L'citar, the ship's com and tactical officer respectively. \"Officers, please, come with us. The Captain has requested all Bishop officers to join him for a briefing immediately.\" That was out of the ordinary, so Alit jumped on his feet and almost rushed towards the briefing room. Densk was right behind him, but L'citar was a Byrhilf - a proud client race of the Hiloi - and noticeably slower, so he took more time to join them. Luckily, he was the only non-Hiloi officer on the ship, so everyone else was present and accounted for by the time he arrived, and the Captain started. Captain Iltess was a man of few words, as befitted one born under the sign of the Sorrowful Matron. The Goddess of Victory gave her favorites a keen tactical mind, bravery and leadership, but no interest in making long-winded speeches. That belonged more to the Shrouded Captain's priestts and the Soothing Torch's politicians. Hence, it was no surprise to Alit that the Captain immediately laid out the problem. \"We have received a transmission from Planet DX-2552 Threshold of Redemption, local name Earth. It's not unusual for us, we've received low-intensity waves, echoes of local communications, during our surveys of the sector before. In fact, they even sent out deliberate attempts to contact other races before. But this time it's different.\" Densk shook his whiskers in an interrogative gesture. \"Threshold of Redemption? Isn't that the quarantined Class 3 planet with a sub-FTL civilization? The Heymans?\" \"Humans, actually,\" answered Captain Iltess. \"And they're not sub-FTL. Not anymore. Look:\" As he said these words, the Captain activated the briefing display. A human face sprang up between them all - Alit noted, with mild amusement, that Humans looked almost exactly like two-eyed Ine'l. The small patch of hair on the top of its head was the color of the morning sun, and the rest of its face was pale and hairless, with very pale blue eyes and round pupils. When it started speaking, its high-pitched voice was overlaid with a synthetised translation in Hiloira. \" This is Captain Lyudmila Dimitryevna Karpov, of the UNS Lighthouse. We're broadcasting this on all frequencies to let anyone in the vicinity know that we've just completed our very first hyperjump, or FTL jump, or whatever it is you people call it. There are more of my people preparing more ships, and we're going to meet very soon. I hope this message serves as a sample to work on interpreting our language, that'll be useful for our first meeting. I don't know what kind of galactic community there is out there, but we're excited to meet you all! \" The natural voice under the synthetizer seemed sincere, almost eager. Alit couldn't understand the Captain and XO's reluctance. \"This is good news,\" he ventured. \"Now we can start negotiating with them to integrate them into the Empire, and bring their gods into our fol Before he could finish, Crusader Settn flattened his ears and almost bared his fangs at him, a reprimand so strong that it would usually be reserved for criminal misbehavior or negligence. Stunned, Alit was left wondering what had prompted that outburst. The Captain raised a calming hand and went on. \"While it would generally be a good thing, the Emperor and the Cardinals have determined that Earth is to remain quarantined indefinitely. You see, the Humans have exhibited throughout history a peculiar taste for making war.\" \"That's not exactly unusual, sir...\" Densk dared. And it wasn't. A lot of civilizations encountered by the Hiloi had martial cultures. The Byrhilf had lived in warring clans, the system-spanning Dieppal had established clashing planetary kingdoms, and the avian K'K'kt'K has settled all their bloodline disputes in all-out aerial combat between the males of each involved family. The Hiloi themselves did not relish war, but they knew of it. \"I mean, Captain, our own Sorrowful Matron taught us the ways of war...\" \"Perhaps, but the Sorrowful Matron teaches to strike quickly, cleanly and with resolve at the most valuable objectives. She never taught us savagery and destruction. Take a look at what information we have of their gods - artwork, video and other recovered media...\" More images sprang up from the display. A painting of a city, destroyed by a rain of fire as hapless survivors cowered before the divine. A man, naked but for a loincloth, twisting with pain on a wooden cross as blood dripped down to be collected in a cup, his face raised to the sky in silent prayer. A many-armed being, blue-skinned and dancing on a dead body, holding an assortment of weapons and battle trophies. A priest in a feathered robe plucking out the heart of a bound victim as a sacrifice atop a blood-caked pyramid. Another questioning a screaming, broken victim of torture before leading him to a woodpile and setting it alight. And yet another ululating religious cries in apparent ecstasy as he sliced through the throat of a helpless captive in a desert. The images went on and on until Alit felt sick to his stomach..... And he barely noticed when the Captain started speaking again. \"They worship gods of savagery and bloodthirst, who teach pain and destruction to those who would serve them. Send a message to the Fleet, the Cardinals and the Emperor Himself. Quarantine of Threshold of Redemption is broken. Mobilize all ships. Their gods can not be allowed to join ours - they can not be allowed allowed beyond their planet. There is no solution other than total war.\"", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "\"Under the aegis of our gods we took to the stars. Under the guidance of the Pearl of Dawn we ranged out and met other species. With the kindness of the Keeper of Hearths we brought them to our fold. Behind the protection of the Sorrowful Matron we defeated their attacks. Under the gaze of the Shrouded Captain we accepted their gods alongside ours. And now, following the light of the Soothing Torch, we will bring glory to our empire.\" It was a common prayer, and Alit spent a few moments meditating on its meaning before getting to his feet and walking out of the Chapel. It was about giving praise to the gods, of course, but not only. It was about trust. The gods had always stood by the Hiloi, from the founding of the First Empire, through the First and Second Interregnums and the Second Empire of today. The prayer was about reaffirming the Hiloi's commitment to the covenant between them and their gods, and most importantly trust that as long as that covenant held, nothing could shake the Empire. Alit made his way to the Emperor Hijraska's bridge, pausing only briefly when he came across the ship's Chaplain to kiss his ceremonial ring. He'd barely taken his station as the bridge's nav officer that Crusader Settn, the Hijraska's XO, appeared, prompting the officers on the bridge to murmur a Psalm of Benediction as naval tradition mandated. Settn's face was grim and his second pair of ears flat against the top of his head - a sure sign of the worry that ate him inside. He gestured to Alit first, then to Densk and L'citar, the ship's com and tactical officer respectively. \"Officers, please, come with us. The Captain has requested all Bishop officers to join him for a briefing immediately.\" That was out of the ordinary, so Alit jumped on his feet and almost rushed towards the briefing room. Densk was right behind him, but L'citar was a Byrhilf - a proud client race of the Hiloi - and noticeably slower, so he took more time to join them. Luckily, he was the only non-Hiloi officer on the ship, so everyone else was present and accounted for by the time he arrived, and the Captain started. Captain Iltess was a man of few words, as befitted one born under the sign of the Sorrowful Matron. The Goddess of Victory gave her favorites a keen tactical mind, bravery and leadership, but no interest in making long-winded speeches. That belonged more to the Shrouded Captain's priestts and the Soothing Torch's politicians. Hence, it was no surprise to Alit that the Captain immediately laid out the problem. \"We have received a transmission from Planet DX-2552 Threshold of Redemption, local name Earth. It's not unusual for us, we've received low-intensity waves, echoes of local communications, during our surveys of the sector before. In fact, they even sent out deliberate attempts to contact other races before. But this time it's different.\" Densk shook his whiskers in an interrogative gesture. \"Threshold of Redemption? Isn't that the quarantined Class 3 planet with a sub-FTL civilization? The Heymans?\" \"Humans, actually,\" answered Captain Iltess. \"And they're not sub-FTL. Not anymore. Look:\" As he said these words, the Captain activated the briefing display. A human face sprang up between them all - Alit noted, with mild amusement, that Humans looked almost exactly like two-eyed Ine'l. The small patch of hair on the top of its head was the color of the morning sun, and the rest of its face was pale and hairless, with very pale blue eyes and round pupils. When it started speaking, its high-pitched voice was overlaid with a synthetised translation in Hiloira. \" This is Captain Lyudmila Dimitryevna Karpov, of the UNS Lighthouse. We're broadcasting this on all frequencies to let anyone in the vicinity know that we've just completed our very first hyperjump, or FTL jump, or whatever it is you people call it. There are more of my people preparing more ships, and we're going to meet very soon. I hope this message serves as a sample to work on interpreting our language, that'll be useful for our first meeting. I don't know what kind of galactic community there is out there, but we're excited to meet you all! \" The natural voice under the synthetizer seemed sincere, almost eager. Alit couldn't understand the Captain and XO's reluctance. \"This is good news,\" he ventured. \"Now we can start negotiating with them to integrate them into the Empire, and bring their gods into our fol Before he could finish, Crusader Settn flattened his ears and almost bared his fangs at him, a reprimand so strong that it would usually be reserved for criminal misbehavior or negligence. Stunned, Alit was left wondering what had prompted that outburst. The Captain raised a calming hand and went on. \"While it would generally be a good thing, the Emperor and the Cardinals have determined that Earth is to remain quarantined indefinitely. You see, the Humans have exhibited throughout history a peculiar taste for making war.\" \"That's not exactly unusual, sir...\" Densk dared. And it wasn't.

Jeremy: Helloooo Hellooooo, thank you thank you, and welcome to the Grand Tour. Coming to you from Isla Meurta. James: I say doesn't that mean the Island of Death? Jeremy: Yes it does James, but don't think too much about it we've been in worse places. James: Like what, exactly? I saw an actual Dinosaur as we came in on the Engine Helicopter. Four feet and a giant gaping mouth. Hammond: Looked rather like Margaret Thatcher Jeremy: Thank you Richard. No that was a herbivore, and we like herbivores, they don't try to eat us. Richard: Wait hold on how do you know it was a herbivore? You are no expert on dinosaurs sir. In fact you are an expert on nothing. Why are we here? Jeremy: Hammond we are here because your lawyer called the Producers and informed them that you now own this park, and the Producers saw an opportunity. Richard: Wait hold on, I own this now? They didn't tell me that. Jeremy: No they were waiting to see if you got eaten first. James: May I just point out that while the dinosaur we saw when we first landed was in fact a Diplodocus and thus a herbivore, there are signs on this map I've just been handed by the Producers which clearly say Tyrannosaurus Rex pens and Velociraptor Field. These are not..... Jeremy: Yes yes, that's all well and good James, but nobody cares about what you're saying because it's boring. We have been given a challenge. We are to, in a word, survive. We will make our way from this welcome center, through the Raptor fields, past the T-Rex pen, and lastly finish the tour at the exit gates here at the ferry dock. And we will be doing so in these: Richard you'll be driving a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee. James you shall be driving a 1988 Toyota Land Cruiser, and I shall be driving a 2001 Land Rover. Mine of course has more power, because I asked for the most powerful one. James: They all look hideous. Jeremy: Blame Hammond for that, he owns this place now this is his paint scheme. Richard: Wait you can't blame me for this I've just found out I own the place. And don't touch that, that looks expensive to fix. Announcer Jeremy: So we set off on our tour of the island. The Producers gave each of us a flare gun and a package of bear spray, along with a map. James wanted to lead the way but I quickly determined that he was going too slowly so I chose an opportune moment to surge ahead. James: Clarkson you pillock, we have no idea what's ahead of us, slow down! Richard: Yes slow down Jeremy, you might crash into my new park and if you do you're paying for the damages. Jeremy: Hammond if I crash into anything it will just be petrol in a few years so look on the bright side, you've got a future in OPEC! Announcer Jeremy: Everything was going smoothly under my direction when suddenly things took a turn for the worse. James:..... of course this entire park appears to be fabricated from plants and animals that evolved millions of years apart, and could never have existed the same time. That plant over to our right for example is from the Triassic era, while that small dinosaur up ahead would appear to have been from the Tithonian age..... Announcer Richard: James was then attacked by a large number of small dinosaurs. The Toyota was up to the task. James: Get away from me you little bast...... Jeremy: Everything ok back there James? I accidentally bumped a gate open a few minutes ago, I trust everything is progressing normally? James: Clarkson you cock, you've let some dinosaurs out into the wild and they've attacked my truck. My tires have been eaten by some sort of acid. Richard: What do you mean you bumped a gate open Jeremy? If you've damaged my park I'm going to have it taken from your pay. Announcer Jeremy: We progressed through the park, James with a new tire and horribly scarred paint job that actually improved the look of his Toyota. As we approached the Raptor portion of the journey Richard began to show signs of sluggishness. Jeremy: Something wrong with your Jeep Richard? You seem to be falling behind. Richard: No, no nothing wrong with the Jeep. I just keep feeling like we are being watched. James: Of course we're being watched there are cameras all over the place. Richard: No, I think there's something out there. Announcer Jeremy: Hammond was right. His natural instincts as a small animal that survived by sensing when hunters were tracking him were showing through. James: Come on Richard. Everything is behind a fence. Unless Jeremy has broken another gate. Jeremy: I merely grazed that one thank you very much. Richard: Grazed it? Going 50 MPH? Jeremy: Oh cheer up Hammond, look at all this magnificent land, all of it yours. Richard: Not after you get through with it, you're destroying it piece by piece. And what was that noise? Announcer James: That noise was in fact, a Raptor jumping onto the roof of Richards Jeep. James: Wow, what an excellent example of a Velociraptor. Flash it with your high beams Richard. Richard: Ahhhhhhhhhhh Jeremy: Hammond control yourself. The Producers wouldn't send us out here in the wild if they thought we could come to harm. Use your bear spray, I'm sure it will work. Richard: Ahhhh, the cap is broken, the cap is broken. Here we go, and ahhhhOhh god I've sprayed myself. I've sprayed myself. And peed myself if I'm honest. James: It's worked, the bear spray is driving the Raptor away! By Jove Hammond! Announcer Jeremy: Having survived the Raptors and the devious Compys, we now made our way into the dragons den of all lions dens. The Tyrannosaurus Rex pen. All of us were more than willing to proceed past this point in the tour but the Producers insisted. Jeremy:..... And so you see the Land Rover is simply superior to anything else on the road. Look at what we've been through so far. My Land Rover has managed to suffer nothing but a few dents in the bumper. Hammond's Jeep is a mess of urine feces and bear spray, which I'm sure will take forever to clean and the roof is barely holding up. James Land Cruiser is of course the indestructible truck but even it could not escape this tour unscathed. Richard: Jeremy you've gone off the road. Jeremy you're on the wrong path. Jeremy: That's ok, my Land Rover can handle anything. I know what I'm doing, I'm going to race you both to the dock. James: You win Jeremy, come back please. You're headed into the T-Rex pen itself. It's marked off limits. Jeremy: No no, I will have none of your nonsense James May. They could not have a fully grown T-Rex on this island, it's too small. It would starve. My Land Rover can out race anything else on this island, including you're two pitiful excuses for 4x4s. Announcer Richard: And with that we shut up and let him go. We could always find a new co-host. Chris Evans isn't doing anything. Jeremy: I may have erred when I said they couldn't have a full grown T-Rex on this island. Because I am stuck right now in a ditch. A ditch that looks remarkably like a footprint. And I don't know if I can get out of it. Time to switch to sport mode. And now press the fiddly little button, and here we go....no no that didn't do it. I'll have to engage the Terrain Management system and switch it to MudRuts. There we go and..... hahah yes we are free! Britain is gloriously victorious once again! Announcer Jeremy: I shouldn't have been so happy. I might have been out of the ditch but my efforts to gain freedom had been noticed. Jeremy: Oh my god what is that? Must go faster. Land Rover don't fail me now! James: Jeremy scientists estimate that T-Rexs can only reach a top speed of 40 kilometers per hour! You can do it Clarkson! Announcer Richard: As we rounded the last bend to the docks we could see Jeremy in his Land Rover being chased by a T-Rex. Richard: It's almost got you Jeremy, turn hard right! James: Yes, lets see what turns better, a Land Rover or a T-Rex. Clarkson: Now is really not the time James! Announcer James: In fact it was. Clarkson's sharp turn was in fact the difference, and as we boarded the ferry, our cars full of mud and our own biowaste, we couldn't help but thank goodness that dinosaurs couldn't fly.

Then it is unlikely you have modified your mind. As such, you are likely awake, and we are partaking in brain-talking. How did you contact us today? I did what it said on the box, I focused on the pattern until I saw all those flashing lights- Those are the'tone signal' Right, the tongue signal, then I yelled as loud as I could that I needed tech support. For future reference, you need only think of your need for technical assistance. Spoken words are not necessary. Yeah, I know, my neighbors told me while I was on hold.

Where is your grandson's Focusing Sigil now? Well that's the problem, I don't know. I know he gave it to me. Well, I mean, he told me he gave it to me but he didn't hand anything over.

It is programmed to always face you, you need to actually turn it to see a different facet. Okay, my hands just go right through the thing. Why didn't you tell me it wasn't real?

I'll have to ask you to cease using such pejorative language. I am! Dammit, when I bought this box, the salesperson told me, he told me that I could get help from someone just as real as he was. ..... Dammit! He was a robot too!? I thought you were supposed to wear those badges so us regular humans like me can tell! Sir, please concentrate on..... No! It's bad enough you're taking our sales jobs and marrying our grandsons, now I can't even talk to another human being over the phone! Is this your grandson's sigil? Yes, there it is. Was that that hard? Geez. I have good news and bad news. Well you fixed it, so I'm not really interested in- The good news is that I have tuned your Planestore to your contacts, so that it will be easy for you to make outgoing communications in the future.

If you had integrated a legal brain modification, you would be aware of its activity Just hold up there, I don't think I like what you're implying. I'm not a wirehead like those damn street-slobs! Then it is unlikely you have modified your mind. As such, you are likely awake, and we are partaking in brain-talking. How did you contact us today? I did what it said on the box, I focused on the pattern until I saw all those flashing lights- Those are the'tone signal' Right, the tongue signal, then I yelled as loud as I could that I needed tech support. For future reference, you need only think of your need for technical assistance. Spoken words are not necessary. Yeah, I know, my neighbors told me while I was on hold. Pretty loud about it themselves, for people who wanted quiet. Have you attempted to replicate this when contacting your grandson? What, yelling? I mean..... okay, I can yell really loud if that will work. No, have you attempted to concentrate on his Focusing Sigil until you attained a mindstate compatible with the tone signal? ..... yes? Where is your grandson's Focusing Sigil now? Well that's the problem, I don't know. I know he gave it to me. Well, I mean, he told me he gave it to me but he didn't hand anything over. He just said that it'd be in my hide-moss planet store, whatever that meant. Your Hypermos Planestore is the'box' you were referring to earlier. Where is it? Floating in the middle of the room, like usual. I mean, your signal is right on there but I don't see any others. You likely have the Planestore tuned to an introductory focus; try to turn it to'contacts' I've already walked around the box, it's the same thing on all its sides. It is programmed to always face you, you need to actually turn it to see a different facet. Okay, my hands just go right through the thing. Why didn't you tell me it wasn't real? It is as real as I am. Like all other aspects of the Planestore, you must concentrate to- As real as you..... dammit! Am I talking to a robot? I'll have to ask you to cease using such pejorative language. I am! Dammit, when I bought this box, the salesperson told me, he told me that I could get help from someone just as real as he was. ..... Dammit! He was a robot too!? I thought you were supposed to wear those badges so us regular humans like me can tell! Sir, please concentrate on..... No! It's bad enough you're taking our sales jobs and marrying our grandsons, now I can't even talk to another human being over the phone! Is this your grandson's sigil? Yes, there it is. Was that that hard? Geez. I have good news and bad news. Well you fixed it, so I'm not really interested in- The good news is that I have tuned your Planestore to your contacts, so that it will be easy for you to make outgoing communications in the future. Right, but- The bad news is that I believe you wished to contact your grandson in order to schedule a dinner with him? A dinner that he has been attempting to make for some time, in order to introduce you to his fiancai? How did you know that? Your grandson's fiancai works in a call center for Hypermos Wait, are you saying- It is a pleasure to meet you, future grandfather-in-law"}

{"original_text": "He sat motionless in the car, eyes fixed on the house opposite. The house was in darkness, no light save for the pale illumination of the moon bathing the street in an eerie whitewash. The large house sat detached from any other on the street, it's large expanse of verdant garden surrounding it like a moat bordered by a low chain link fence. He glanced at the digital segment display clock embedded in the dash, the numbers glowing an ethereal green, momentarily before returning his gaze to the house. Beds of brightly pigmented flowers lined the pathway to the front door and dotted the lawn, a sea of purples, yellows, and reds. A great silver birch tree dominated the scene, rising nearly as tall as the two storey house's slate tiled roof, it's bark gleaming in the moon's glare, matching the house's whitewashed wood panels in luminance. He grabbed the white cigarette box from the passenger seat, opened it, and plucked a cigarette fluidly, placing it between his lips loosely and throwing the box back onto the seat. A click echoed through the silence of the car as he pushed the cigarette lighter into the socket. Moments later it popped back out, the smell of burnt dust accenting the air. He picked it up and brought the glowing orange coil to the end of the cigarette and lit it. Placing the lighter back in the socket he inhaled deeply on the freshly lit cigarette, the tip glowing a deep red as he did so. Nearly time he thought. The exhalation filled the car with smoke, a thick yellowish haze which made him crack a window to ensure a perfect line of sight on the house. Nothing could go wrong tonight, this was his one shot. The cigarette shortened as the man waited until finally he flicked it from the window, the used butt smouldering on the asphalt. Now was the time, he thought to himself as he stared into his reflection in the mirror, an empty gaze meeting his own. The car door swung open and the man purposefully stepped out. He stood for a moment, hand resting on the door frame, whilst he surveiled the area one last time. Still as the grave. He might've chuckled had the task ahead not been facing him. Striding forward he flung the door behind him shut, the dull thud the only sound in the still night air. It was a cool night, not that it mattered, it had to happen regardless of the weather. A ball of mist hung around his mouth as he exhaled, only to be displaced as he strode forwards, crushing the still-warm cigarette butt beneath his heel as he passed. Stepping up onto the kerb his black dress shoes grated lightly on some loose gravel kicked up no doubt by some passing car. The concrete slabs that lead to the door seemed of the purest white under the bright night sky. Each step brought him closer to the house, his own plan ringing in his ears; kill them, no witnesses. He approached the door and extended his hand towards the unembellished know. His hand hovered an inch away as he weighed up his options. Turning on his heel he stepped down from the porch and headed to the back of house. The back garden was much the same as the front, kept neatly and tended to with much love. A wooden shed stood in the back right corner. He eyed it with curiosity before snapping back to the task at hand. A few cinderblock steps led up to the screen door and he took them silently, unlatching the screen door's length of string from it's makeshift hook and loop configuration. He tried the handle but it yielded no results. Not to be deterred he brought a small cloth roll out of his pocket and laid it out on the top step. An assortment of slim hooked, curved, and straight metal lock picks lined the beige linen. He selected two with a deftness only from years of experience, and put the first into the lock. He tested the pins in the lock gingerly before slotting the tension wrench in, pushing the line again, and twisting. The door swung open, he picked up his tools, pocketed them and went in. It took him a moment to adjust to the absolute darkness inside the house, but before long he could identify a kitchen as the room he was in. A pine table adorned with a red and white checkered water resistant tablecloth stood in the centre of the room. He walked by, running the fingertips of his left middle and ring fingers along the cool surface, focused solely on the doorway ahead of him. Inside the house he could see no doors closed, a godsend for finding his target he thought. Stepping through the doorway he followed the corridor into the main hallway of the house, walking parallel with the steps until he reached their foot where he stopped. Listening closely for a minute he could hear nothing. Could it be that they weren't home? No. No, he'd done far too much research for that to be true. Crouching low he began to ascend the staircase, one step at a time, his shoe making little noise on the strip of carpet running down the middle of the stairs. He stopped at the top. This was it. Finally. Now he just had to carry out his plan like in so many dreams before. He new exactly where to find them. Stepping towards the only closed door he began breathing heavily. He twisted the doorknob and swiftly opened the door, still maintaining silence, though now his movements buzzed with a nervous energy. There, in the otherwise empty double bed, the rapist. Two giant strides and the man was upon his prey. Straddling him on the bed his hands clamped down, crushing his target's windpipe. The shock woke the sleeping man and he began to struggle, hands clawing at his assailant's forearms, torso bucking in an attempt to throw his attacker. Neither man was any larger than average, neither particularly muscular yet the assailant could not be moved, his grim determination set in his eyes, dead in the dim light. As the last ounce of oxygen bled from every cell in the man's body a surge of strength coursed through him, a last ditch attempt to stay on this planet. The two went tumbling off the bed and clattered onto the floor, rolling one on top of the other, each trying to maintain dominance. They traded punches in between grapples, neither willing to relent. The attacker, only slightly larger, used his size to his advantage, sitting on the other man's stomach and swinging wildly at his face. Each hit made a sickening thud and a occasionally even a slight cracking sound. After several minutes of constant abuse the victim lay bloodied and in laboured breaths. The attacker stopped to catch his breath, and in doing so was caught off guard. The man threw his assailant off him and into the wall behind him, stumbling to his feet he threw his entire body weight into a shoulder slam pinning the attacker to the wall by his throat. The drywall cracked behind the attacker and the other man fell backwards onto the bed, keeping himself from falling with a single shaking arm. The attacker stayed slumped back against the wall and coughed, a metallic taste tinged his mouth as he spat and saw blood. The rage boiled within him again. He stepped to the battered form in front of him, it's face barely distinguishable in the dark, though the blood stains on the skin stood out clearly. He reached out a hand, grabbing the man by the collar of his pyjama top, and threw him with all his strength into the ground. He stamped on his skull, again and again, he could feel no more movement but he wouldn't stop until he was sure. From the corner of his eye he saw a waist-high wooden cabinet leaning against the wall. Perfect. He dragged it along the wall to be next to the man on the floor, it's weight deceptive for the size. With the faintest trace of a smile he put all his strength into tipping it. The crunch was sickening and the mess on the floor worse, his victim's head now split and flattened. The dark red blood seeped into the pores of the wood between which the head had been sandwiched. Chunks of everything this man had been squelched underfoot as the killer walked towards the door, the puddles of blood splashing onto his ankles as he walked. As he reached the doorway, head spinning with the delirium of finally killing the rapist he'd planned the death of for so long, his stomach turned to ice and his heart froze. A pair of clear blue eyes looked up at him. Illuminated by a ray of moonlight was the tear-streaked face of a young girl, porcelain skin contrasting long brown hair, reaching down to her pink nightie, teddy bear in hand. The rapist had been a father, he had been a person. So dead set on retribution the man had been he hadn't even considered there being a person behind the villainous cretin. Yet here stood the furthest from that possible, here stood innocence and beauty, here stood happiness and life. Here stood a witness. \"Daddy?\" she whimpered. No witnesses, he thought.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "He sat motionless in the car, eyes fixed on the house opposite. The house was in darkness, no light save for the pale illumination of the moon bathing the street in an eerie whitewash. The large house sat detached from any other on the street, it's large expanse of verdant garden surrounding it like a moat bordered by a low chain link fence. He glanced at the digital segment display clock embedded in the dash, the numbers glowing an ethereal green, momentarily before returning his gaze to the house. Beds of brightly pigmented flowers lined the pathway to the front door and dotted the lawn, a sea of purples, yellows, and reds. A great silver birch tree dominated the scene, rising nearly as tall as the two storey house's slate tiled roof, it's bark gleaming in the moon's glare, matching the house's whitewashed wood panels in luminance. He grabbed the white cigarette box from the passenger seat, opened it, and plucked a cigarette fluidly, placing it between his lips loosely and throwing the box back onto the seat. A click echoed through the silence of the car as he pushed the cigarette lighter into the socket. Moments later it popped back out, the smell of burnt dust accenting the air. He picked it up and brought the glowing orange coil to the end of the cigarette and lit it. Placing the lighter back in the socket he inhaled deeply on the freshly lit cigarette, the tip glowing a deep red as he did so. Nearly time he thought. The exhalation filled the car with smoke, a thick yellowish haze which made him crack a window to ensure a perfect line of sight on the house. Nothing could go wrong tonight, this was his one shot. The cigarette shortened as the man waited until finally he flicked it from the window, the used butt smouldering on the asphalt. Now was the time, he thought to himself as he stared into his reflection in the mirror, an empty gaze meeting his own. The car door swung open and the man purposefully stepped out. He stood for a moment, hand resting on the door frame, whilst he surveiled the area one last time. Still as the grave. He might've chuckled had the task ahead not been facing him. Striding forward he flung the door behind him shut, the dull thud the only sound in the still night air. It was a cool night, not that it mattered, it had to happen regardless of the weather. A ball of mist hung around his mouth as he exhaled, only to be displaced as he strode forwards, crushing the still-warm cigarette butt beneath his heel as he passed. Stepping up onto the kerb his black dress shoes grated lightly on some loose gravel kicked up no doubt by some passing car. The concrete slabs that lead to the door seemed of the purest white under the bright night sky. Each step brought him closer to the house, his own plan ringing in his ears; kill them, no witnesses. He approached the door and extended his hand towards the unembellished know. His hand hovered an inch away as he weighed up his options. Turning on his heel he stepped down from the porch and headed to the back of house. The back garden was much the same as the front, kept neatly and tended to with much love. A wooden shed stood in the back right corner. He eyed it with curiosity before snapping back to the task at hand. A few cinderblock steps led up to the screen door and he took them silently, unlatching the screen door's length of string from it's makeshift hook and loop configuration. He tried the handle but it yielded no results. Not to be deterred he brought a small cloth roll out of his pocket and laid it out on the top step. An assortment of slim hooked, curved, and straight metal lock picks lined the beige linen. He selected two with a deftness only from years of experience, and put the first into the lock. He tested the pins in the lock gingerly before slotting the tension wrench in, pushing the line again, and twisting. The door swung open, he picked up his tools, pocketed them and went in. It took him a moment to adjust to the absolute darkness inside the house, but before long he could identify a kitchen as the room he was in. A pine table adorned with a red and white checkered water resistant tablecloth stood in the centre of the room. He walked by, running the fingertips of his left middle and ring fingers along the cool surface, focused solely on the doorway ahead of him. Inside the house he could see no doors closed, a godsend for finding his target he thought. Stepping through the doorway he followed the corridor into the main hallway of the house, walking parallel with the steps until he reached their foot where he stopped. Listening closely for a minute he could hear nothing. Could it be that they weren't home? No. No, he'd done far too much research for that to be true. Crouching low he began to ascend the staircase, one step at a time, his shoe making little noise on the strip of carpet running down the middle of the stairs. He stopped at the top. This was it. Finally. Now he just had to carry out his plan like in so many dreams before. He new exactly where to find them. Stepping towards the only closed door he began breathing heavily. He twisted the doorknob and swiftly opened the door, still maintaining silence, though now his movements buzzed with a nervous energy. There, in the otherwise empty double bed, the rapist. Two giant strides and the man was upon his prey. Straddling him on the bed his hands clamped down, crushing his target's windpipe. The shock woke the sleeping man and he began to struggle, hands clawing at his assailant's forearms, torso bucking in an attempt to throw his attacker. Neither man was any larger than average, neither particularly muscular yet the assailant could not be moved, his grim determination set in his eyes, dead in the dim light. As the last ounce of oxygen bled from every cell in the man's body a surge of strength coursed through him, a last ditch attempt to stay on this planet. The two went tumbling off the bed and clattered onto the floor, rolling one on top of the other, each trying to maintain dominance. They traded punches in between grapples, neither willing to relent. The attacker, only slightly larger, used his size to his advantage, sitting on the other man's stomach and swinging wildly at his face. Each hit made a sickening thud and a occasionally even a slight cracking sound. After several minutes of constant abuse the victim lay bloodied and in laboured breaths. The attacker stopped to catch his breath, and in doing so was caught off guard. The man threw his assailant off him and into the wall behind him, stumbling to his feet he threw his entire body weight into a shoulder slam pinning the attacker to the wall by his throat. The drywall cracked behind the attacker and the other man fell backwards onto the bed, keeping himself from falling with a single shaking arm. The attacker stayed slumped back against the wall and coughed, a metallic taste tinged his mouth as he spat and saw blood. The rage boiled within him again. He stepped to the battered form in front of him, it's face barely distinguishable in the dark, though the blood stains on the skin stood out clearly. He reached out a hand, grabbing the man by the collar of his pyjama top, and threw him with all his strength into the ground. He stamped on his skull, again and again, he could feel no more movement but he wouldn't stop until he was sure. From the corner of his eye he saw a waist-high wooden cabinet leaning against the wall. Perfect. He dragged it along the wall to be next to the man on the floor, it's weight deceptive for the size. With the faintest trace of a smile he put all his strength into tipping it. The crunch was sickening and the mess on the floor worse, his victim's head now split and flattened. The dark red blood seeped into the pores of the wood between which the head had been sandwiched. Chunks of everything this man had been squelched underfoot as the killer walked towards the door, the puddles of blood splashing onto his ankles as he walked. As he reached the doorway, head spinning with the delirium of finally killing the rapist he'd planned the death of for so long, his stomach turned to ice and his heart froze. A pair of clear blue eyes looked up at him. Illuminated by a ray of moonlight was the tear-streaked face of a young girl, porcelain skin contrasting long brown hair, reaching down to her pink nightie, teddy bear in hand.

{"original_text": "Mariposa just continued to glower at the teenage boy in the corner. There was just no word she could even say about this, no way of even justifying what had occurred, beyond a disgusted and annoyed silence. It didn't help Lord Justice and the Manta-Ray had insisted she come along with them. Not just to add this new lad into the Heroic Society of America's roster, no. That would be bad enough, but this. This was just completely out of the question. Voting this boy into the lead chair? For his accomplishments? She scoffed, even as he flashed her a foxy grin. \"Come on,\" He tried to lighten the mood, winking from beneath his lemon-yellow face-mask. God, it had to be a yellow-themed costume as well. Disgusting. And she was not even going to think about the emoji character emblazoned on his chest. At least thanks to copyright law, he'd be forced to change it before being inducted. That is, if Apple didn't feel the need to thank him by giving him the copyright to said emoji. \"You have to admit, it's funny.\" The boy tried again, holding a hand up to Mariposa. Immediately, she pulled away. Hell no, she was not going to allow him to touch her. \"This is a mockery for everything we stand for.\" Mariposa muttered darkly. Even with the bright yellow domino mask, she could see the confusion painting his face. \"Wha- Haven't you killed someone before? Aren't you one of the only big three of the Heroic Society that kills people?\" He said, glaring hard at her. That at least shook him out of that cocky stance, leaning against Lord Justice's desk and shooting any C-rank heroines'finger guns' as he called it. \"Not that, fool. You know what I mean!\" Mariposa snapped back, not wanting to say it. She tried to spit it out, before waving her hand around mid-waist, attempting to make the implication. \"That.\" \"It's..... Really not that big of a deal. It's just how my powers work, water expulsion.\" He shrugged, \"I mean, it'd be better if I could make it come out by sweat and tears as well, but then I couldn't call myself The Whizzard, now can I?\" \"I can not believe I am having this conversation. This is what my life has become. This is what justice and superheroics has become. Nebulus, Master of the Black Hole, Destroyer of Galaxies, Eater of Gods. The most nightmarish threat to all of mankind. And you defeated him by making him piss himself to death.\" Whizzard went silent, looking down at the ground, \" ..... Well, I'm not going to be ashamed of that.\" He said, \"We can't all have super-strength, fairy wings, or glittering rays of light, alright? I was dealt a weird hand, so I just made it work. You have mastery over plants and insects and can fly, so you're the Butterfly Queen, Mariposa.\" With that, he motioned over to the magenta and black wings on her back. \"I have mastery over the human bladder's ability to hold liquid.\" \"And was there no others that could have aided you?\" That disgust was not going to yield simply because he couldn't do anything else.

{"original_text": "A whiff of incense floated across the arena as the Terran gate crashed wide open, all the bells and whistles sounded, and silhouetted against the harsh light to his back stood the imposing figure of General Kallan, ready to lead his troops into battle. The air crackled with anticipation as the soldiers behind him tightened their grips on their weapons, eager to follow their fearless leader into the fray. As General Kallan stepped forward, the crowd erupted in cheers and applause, shouting his name and waving banners emblazoned with his image. He raised his hand and the noise died down, replaced by an uneasy silence as he spoke. \"My fellow Terrans,\" he began, his deep voice carrying across the arena, \"today we face a great challenge. Our enemies seek to destroy us, to wipe out all that we hold dear. But we will not let them win. We will fight with all our strength, with all our courage, and we will emerge victorious!\" The crowd roared in agreement, brandishing their own weapons and shouting words of support.

Night shift was nice, the lights were dimmed aboard the ship, and the engines' steady hum was soothing. But as soon as Jim stepped into the engine room, he knew something was off. The humming was louder than usual, and there was a strange rattling sound coming from one of the turbines. Jim walked around the engine room checking every gauge and meter, but nothing seemed out of place. He started to think that maybe he was just being paranoid, but then the rattling sound grew louder. He traced the noise to one of the turbines, and when he opened it up, he found a damaged bearing. Jim knew he had to act fast. He shut off the turbine and radioed for the on-call engineer. He then spent the next few hours replacing the damaged bearing with a spare one, all while keeping a watchful eye on the other turbines. Thanks to Jim's quick thinking, the problem was resolved without any damage to the engines or the ship. The on-call engineer arrived just in time to help Jim finish the repairs, and together they restarted the engines. As Jim walked out of the engine room, exhausted but relieved, he realized that it wasn't just luck that he had drawn the short straw for night shift.

His strength, speed, durability, all of his stats, average. Mediocre. No rescues in 22 years, no villains or anti-heroes taken down, nothing.

At the tender age of two, I was already scraping craters out of our front lawn - something my father found amusing, despite my mother's furious stares. He was a man of discovery, always tinkering away at something or other in his garage workshop, and I took to his example from the beginning. By age eleven, I had finished the tunnel system underneath our backyard, complete with sleeping quarters and a dining room. My father beamed as I rushed from entrance to exit, showing off my hard work. That night, my mother put her foot down. They shipped me off to Winghamton Prep shortly after that. Mother thought it would knock some sense into me - get me to see that there was more to life than digging holes - but she could not have been more wrong. Within six months, the groundskeepers were complaining of a gopher infestation; in a year, I'd turned the underside of Barclay Hall into a tunneled paradise. I heard my name whispered during lulls in lunchtime conversation: Gary Parsons, Master of the Underground. Everyone wanted to see my work. For the first time since the day I showed my father the house passages, I was happy. The structural collapse of Barclay Hall put an end to that. There was never supposed to be a party in the tunnels; the popular crowd took what they thought was theirs and paid the price.

Kate's BFF had reminded her that Patches was in pain and this was the best. Parents and friends, in that rare collision of conformity, had prevailed and Kate had spent the better part of the night crying. But there she was.

He looked like he hadn't slept in days, but he had a friendly smile on his face. \"Hey there,\" he said. \"Do you have any maps?\" She looked around the store, trying to remember if they had any maps in stock. After a moment, she found one tucked away in a dusty corner. She handed it to the man, who looked it over quickly before thanking her and heading out the door. As he walked away, something about him made her curious. She wondered where he was going and what he was searching for. She realized then that she had been stuck in this town for too long, and it was time for her to leave and start exploring the world. The next day, she put in her two weeks' notice at the convenience store and packed her bags. She didn't know where she was going or what she would find, but she knew that anything was better than sitting behind that counter, swatting flies and listening to the drone of the old ratty ceiling fan.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "This is the story of a young woman stuck in a small town in the American Midwest, struggling to make ends meet as she waits for her father to come home."}

They were much more interested in the particulars of the Ark Project, and in trying to figure out just why it was that the World Government had been so secretive about it.

{"original_text": "This is becoming pretty long! - I live in the City of Northern Light. It's about twice the size of Little Cleveland, half the size of Lex, and a small dot compared to New Atlantis. In school they told us it's supposed to be one of the oldest cities in the country. It's the oldest I know of. It has a over a million people, 50 schools and universities combined, 14 Halo department stores, and a lot more. Best of all though, it has an abandoned school from over 100 years ago that me and my buddies sneak into every Saturday. Nobody knows it, but the sewer that runs through the town and under Aurora Park has a connection to it. We sneak in through a manhole in the park and leave whenever we want. The school is called Alexandra's School of Engineering and it used to be some sort of hub of technology before the world around us was built. I can't imagine what things would have been like before Northern Light existed, but I imagine it was not very interesting and maybe it was dark without the city's lights. Usually my buddy Julius and I spent an hour hoverboarding up and down the old engineering hill where all of the graduate students built their models. Its like a monument and it's better than any terrain park I've ever seen outside, back in Northern Light. The school itself was like a giant domed colosseum of buildings. There were a few lights up on top that were still on, giving the place the feel of about 8 PM in Northern Light, the time when they dim the city lights. Somedays our group goes exploring instead. We often don't venture too far into anywhere since there aren't very many functional lights left and it can get a little spooky. On Halloween of this year our friend Casey was turning 15 and he told us he would go deeper into the school than we'd ever been. He wasn't going to be afraid anymore. He had a perfect setup too. There was a cam on his helmet for streaming to us, thanks to the signal boosters he would drop along the way. He had a Neverdie light built for tunneling companies (a light supposedly so efficient that as long as you are moving some every hour, will never die). He would ride his hoverboard along, going through every hallway he could find and if he ever got lost he had his VR goggles set up to guide him back along the trail of virtual breadcrumbs. The whole thing was perfect. We were finally going to get to see the parts of the school we were too afraid to go to before. Well that was the plan anyways. Unfortunately, fearless Mikey K. joined us that day and he rarely let anyone get the better of him. He had already talked about joining Casey, and then Julius went ahead and dared him to ride along. So Mikey went too with no more than the usual gear we carry, which is just a phone (a phone which doesn't even get reception in the depths of the school without signal boosters). Five minutes into their endeavor Casey had already ditched Mikey and was exploring everything we always wanted to see. We mostly forgot about Mikey since we couldn't take our eye off of the stream, but every once in a while one of us got a bad feeling and asked, \" Do you think Mikey's okay? \" Nobody ever responded and we just kept watching. After two hours, Casey was back out in front of the school and we couldn't stop talking about all of the things we'd seen. He'd found tons of old tech for us to play with and even an old mechanical laptop with its ancient charging cable. After the initial excitement died down a bit Casey looked around for Mikey. \" Where's Mikey at, guys? \" he asked. \" I figured he'd run back out right away after I ditched him. \" \" He never came out. \" Julius said. \" I don't think anybody knows what to do. \" \" Shit, guys! \" he yelled. \" Are you kidding? What are you doing, we have to find him! \" \" Yeah, \" I said, \" but we don't have all the gear. You're the only one prepared enough to go. \" \" Are you kidding me? We'll just go in pairs, we aren't leaving Mikey in there. God, sounds like you guys already gave up on him. \" And that was the last of that conversation. We paired up and trekked inside. I went with Julius, Casey went with his little brother, and our other buddies Pete and Suds paired up as well. Unfortunately, there wasn't any good way for us to stay connected. Each group took two of Casey's boosters, but if we really split up it would be hard to get very far and keep connected. After half an hour of searching with Julius he told me he had to take a whiz. We'd been to several rooms Casey hadn't and had a wing left that nobody had been too before. We also didn't end up having any connection to any of the others. The plan was to meet back out front after an hour just in case. The part of the school we were in was the structure that contained the buildings for most of the classes and offices. There were various creepy courtyards full of mostly decayed plants, locker rooms, and gyms with equipment that must have been for keeping fit. Thanks to modern science, most of our gyms are just for practicing sports since working out became an antiquated, obsolete way of staying healthy. All in all, it was quite the interesting place for a bunch of teenage guys to explore. Well, while Julius was taking a piss I went off for a bit just to look around and found an old courtyard similar to the others. I told him I'd be right back, and fully intended to be. I went inside and saw the same dead plants with their withered leaves, untouched by time. After a moment, I saw a hole in the ground by an old dead tree. I leaned in to take a peek with my phone light, intending to digitally map the room and get out. My phone signal wasn't very good though and it was taking a lot longer than normal to get the mapping app working.

I thought to myself as I continued play fighting with my imaginary opponent, \"Could it be that the sword is sharper than usual?\" I paused and examined it closely, noticing a faint glint on the edge. It appeared that the sword had been freshly sharpened, which would explain the strange sound. I continued to wield the sword, testing its newfound sharpness and agility. It felt lighter and more graceful in my hand, allowing for quicker and more precise movements. I realized that this could give me an advantage in a real battle situation. Excitedly, I decided to put my newfound techniques to the test. I searched for a sparring partner and found my friend, Alex. We both donned our armor and picked up our swords, ready for a friendly bout. As we began to spar, I noticed that Alex was struggling to keep up with my newfound skills. My sword slices through the air with ease, and I was able to dodge and strike with lightning-fast reflexes. Alex was impressed but also frustrated, as he struggled to land a hit on me. In the end, we both laughed and congratulated each other on a good match.

An hour later the entire foundation of his duplex seemed to shake and items on shelves and inside cabinets could be heard crashing down and in some cases falling to the floor.

{"original_text": "January 22, 2016. Today's the day. Again. As Jim looked at the date on his computer he couldn't help but feel anxious. He had been here a few times before, yet each time he was filled with a sense of dread. What if it didn't work? Well, he actually knew exactly what would happen if it didn't work. He'd wake up again. The real question was what if it did work. \"So let's run it through one more time.\" said Janet. \"We only have 30 minutes until the heart attack.\" One more time. As if that would help. He had run this plan through his head for centuries, and while Janet was aware of the plan and the stakes, she had no way of knowing she had as well. \"It's not that complicated Janet. In a minute I will step into the chamber, and hopefully, turn into a Popsicle.\" And not be groundhog'd any longer, he thought. He could only imagine it, a world past January 22, 2016. Who knows when he would wake up. The further in time the better. He would have more to work with that way. He could only hope that someone found a way to wake him up before his body decomposed to the point that the universe considered him dead. Then he would just wake up yesterday and have to try again. He thought back to a time when that very thing brought him excitement. The possibilities had been endless. At first he only fixed trivial things. A date gone wrong turned into a blossoming relationship. Failed lottery ticket purchases had turned him into a billionaire. Missed opportunities had turned into open doors all around him. The world was his playground. All it took was the pull of a trigger. Then he had realized the full potential of his groundhogging. He could go back till his very birth and relive his life however he wanted. Over and over. He had been the President of the United States, a world famous musician, an evil genius that ruled most of the world, a philanthropist that changed humanity for the better, a hermit who never left the house, a man who just wanted to die. Over and over and over his life played before him. People and places turned to mere tools that he could use and then restore. As long as he stayed within March 4, 1965 and January 22, 2016. It turns out the only thing he couldn't change was his genetics. No matter how healthy he ate or how in shape he was, his heart would give out today, and he would groundhog. As he looked around his lab he hoped that this time it would be different. With the last 3 lifetimes of work surrounding him, mainly a state of the art cryogenic chamber not expected to be a reality for at least a few more centuries, he wondered what his future would look like. Hopefully it would look like the future. Anytime past tomorrow. Then he would have more than just these past 50 years to utilize. Hell, there may even be someone else like him out there that could help him. \"Alright Jim, everything is dialed in and ready to go. Ready on your word.\" Janet said. Jim nervously walked across the room to the chamber. Please work. Please work. Please work. He kept thinking as he laid his body down into the machine. Once he laid down he heard Janet type into her computer and then the hiss of a motor near his head closed the chamber door. \"Can you hear me?\" Janet said. \"Loud and clear\" He replied over the intercom. \"Alright, we have 10 seconds until freeze.\" She said with a steady voice. \"Thank you for everything Janet. I couldn't have done this without you.\" Jim said. \"That's why you will make sure there is a statue of me in a big city in the future. Right?\" She said as the sound of the chamber's freezing cells started up. Right, he thought. An instant later everything went black. He felt the soft plush of a pillow under his head as he slowly came to. He didn't dare open his eyes. Maybe someone has retrofitted his Cryogenics chamber to be more comfortable. \"Good morning honey. Are you ready to see the future today?\" he heard Janet say from her position laying next to him.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "January 22, 2016. Today's the day. Again. As Jim looked at the date on his computer he couldn't help but feel anxious. He had been here a few times before, yet each time he was filled with a sense of dread. What if it didn't work? Well, he actually knew exactly what would happen if it didn't work. He'd wake up again. The real question was what if it did work. \"So let's run it through one more time.\" said Janet. \"We only have 30 minutes until the heart attack.\" One more time. As if that would help. He had run this plan through his head for centuries, and while Janet was aware of the plan and the stakes, she had no way of knowing she had as well. \"It's not that complicated Janet. In a minute I will step into the chamber, and hopefully, turn into a Popsicle.\" And not be groundhog'd any longer, he thought. He could only imagine it, a world past January 22, 2016. Who knows when he would wake up. The further in time the better. He would have more to work with that way. He could only hope that someone found a way to wake him up before his body decomposed to the point that the universe considered him dead. Then he would just wake up yesterday and have to try again. He thought back to a time when that very thing brought him excitement. The possibilities had been endless. At first he only fixed trivial things. A date gone wrong turned into a blossoming relationship. Failed lottery ticket purchases had turned him into a billionaire. Missed opportunities had turned into open doors all around him. The world was his playground. All it took was the pull of a trigger. Then he had realized the full potential of his groundhogging. He could go back till his very birth and relive his life however he wanted. Over and over. He had been the President of the United States, a world famous musician, an evil genius that ruled most of the world, a philanthropist that changed humanity for the better, a hermit who never left the house, a man who just wanted to die. Over and over and over his life played before him. People and places turned to mere tools that he could use and then restore. As long as he stayed within March 4, 1965 and January 22, 2016. It turns out the only thing he couldn't change was his genetics. No matter how healthy he ate or how in shape he was, his heart would give out today, and he would groundhog. As he looked around his lab he hoped that this time it would be different. With the last 3 lifetimes of work surrounding him, mainly a state of the art cryogenic chamber not expected to be a reality for at least a few more centuries, he wondered what his future would look like. Hopefully it would look like the future. Anytime past tomorrow. Then he would have more than just these past 50 years to utilize. Hell, there may even be someone else like him out there that could help him. \"Alright Jim, everything is dialed in and ready to go. Ready on your word.\" Janet said. Jim nervously walked across the room to the chamber. Please work. Please work. Please work. He kept thinking as he laid his body down into the machine. Once he laid down he heard Janet type into her computer and then the hiss of a motor near his head closed the chamber door. \"Can you hear me?\" Janet said. \"Loud and clear\" He replied over the intercom. \"Alright, we have 10 seconds until freeze.\" She said with a steady voice. \"Thank you for everything Janet.

{"original_text": "For the longest time the rumours coming out of Siberia had been of the apocalyptic variety. Secret bases doing this, quarantines hiding that, civilians disappearing because they had seen those. Misinformation had been circulating ever since the end if the war. Most of them - because there was one notable exception - were lies. Vadim knew this, but he didn't know which were lies. The higher ups trusted him with enough information to do his job but not enough to ever fully know what he was doing. He liked it this way because it made his job a lot easier. Ostensibly it was in case he ever defected or the bureau was ever infiltrated. They could get some information but not a lot - the foreigners thought of communism as'sharing.' Vadim knew how wrong they were. At least here, in his grey office with his grey computer screen and his regulation black pen. Ten minutes to the hour Vadim took a notebook from his top drawer and flicked to the lost recent page. Every one prior to today's had been seen by his superior at the end of working hours and redacted accordingly. All of the lines had once contained Vadim's precise handwriting - now they just held intriguing black bars. He turned the radio dial to the preset channel. Someone else was in charge of the frequency, he just had thirty six dial positions, and thirty five of then broadcast nothing but static. With five minutes to go Vadim adjusted his headset and waited. The first few hundred times Vadim had felt tension at this point. What would the message be? Who was the person broadcasting everything? What was he a part of anyway? \"Situation normal.\" And then static again. Vadim took his pen and recorded the message for the sixth time today. Six messages and three to go.

How the capitalists weren't doing so good. How Russia would prevail. A KV tank had been found in ruins. Those things were still turning up almost thirty years later. Vadim dove further through the papers, highlighting things and recording his findings in his official ledger. That ledger was the only thing that he truly loved about his job. It was the only thing they didn't censor. When he left this job - died - it would be the only thing besides the black bars that proved he was here. And that was when he saw it.

He read and reread until he knew the three paragraphs backwards and forwards. He mouthed along with it.

They believed that in order to prevent this, humanity needed to undergo a spiritual transformation and live in harmony with nature and each other. As a helpful assistant, I suggest that, as individuals, we can take small steps to contribute to this transformation. We can practice empathy and compassion towards others, make conscious choices to reduce our impact on the environment, and seek knowledge and wisdom to deepen our spiritual awareness.

{"original_text": "THE GERMAN BRINDLED DWARF Relatively small (6-10 ft), brown with mottled black, tan, and white spots along the ridge of its back. Prominent spikes that begin at the nape of the neck and continue past the base of the tail; short, powerful limbs used to climb trees. Produces an intense, green bronchial flame that is often seen at night above the treeline. NOTE: this species is identified as THREATENED by the World Dragon Conservation Fund (WDCF). Approximately 3,000 are currently thought to exist in the wild. Since prehistory, the Brindled Dwarf has inhabited the ancient Schwartzwald (Black Forest) of Northern Bavaria. Its diminutive size allows it to deftly navigate the undergrowth, speeding through the trees in pursuit of prey. Until the arrival of humans in Europe, its preferred meal was the giant Megalocerus or, when available, the cave bear. The arrival of Homo sapiens,\" however, initiated one of the bloodiest and most significant events in natural history. We know from cave drawings that the initial years of Cro-Magnon in central Europe were intensely violent. Their migration from the Middle East into Sub-glacial Europe was met by a variety of megafauna with whom these early people had no previous experience: not only dragons but also giants, trolls, and werewolves stalked the forests of Bavaria. In time, each of these were subdued by human ingenuity and weapons - all but the dragons. Hunters and those who went out foraging were picked off easily. Cave art from this period depicts Dwarf dragons springing from trees, charging through the undergrowth, and disemboweling entire families. The nightly terror experienced by Paleolithic humans must have been dreadful indeed. Huddled together, they would have heard the telltale snorting and chirping just paces away from the cave entrance. Occasionally, the darkness would be lit up by bursts of green flame, illuminating the terrified faces of those around them. Their only weapon against dragons was the longspear, which was, of course, only effective at short range. And, once at short range, there was very little hope of survival.

Prominent spikes that begin at the nape of the neck and continue past the base of the tail; short, powerful limbs used to climb trees. Produces an intense, green bronchial flame that is often seen at night above the treeline. NOTE: this species is identified as THREATENED by the World Dragon Conservation Fund (WDCF). Approximately 3,000 are currently thought to exist in the wild. Since prehistory, the Brindled Dwarf has inhabited the ancient Schwartzwald (Black Forest) of Northern Bavaria. Its diminutive size allows it to deftly navigate the undergrowth, speeding through the trees in pursuit of prey. Until the arrival of humans in Europe, its preferred meal was the giant Megalocerus or, when available, the cave bear. The arrival of Homo sapiens,\" however, initiated one of the bloodiest and most significant events in natural history. We know from cave drawings that the initial years of Cro-Magnon in central Europe were intensely violent. Their migration from the Middle East into Sub-glacial Europe was met by a variety of megafauna with whom these early people had no previous experience: not only dragons but also giants, trolls, and werewolves stalked the forests of Bavaria. In time, each of these were subdued by human ingenuity and weapons - all but the dragons. Hunters and those who went out foraging were picked off easily. Cave art from this period depicts Dwarf dragons springing from trees, charging through the undergrowth, and disemboweling entire families. The nightly terror experienced by Paleolithic humans must have been dreadful indeed. Huddled together, they would have heard the telltale snorting and chirping just paces away from the cave entrance. Occasionally, the darkness would be lit up by bursts of green flame, illuminating the terrified faces of those around them. Their only weapon against dragons was the longspear, which was, of course, only effective at short range. And, once at short range, there was very little hope of survival. The advent of the throwing spear, followed by the bow and arrow, marked a turning point in the war between Man and Draconis.

{"original_text": "The ringing of the doorbell broke the silence of my empty home. It was just me that night. Me and now some pizza.'I wonder if they actually made it without burning it this time,' I thought as I made my way to the door. I opened it and was greeted by a tall, lanky guy with a mustache and a delivery bag in his hand. He smiled nervously and extended the bag towards me. \"Hey, sorry for the delay. We had a lot of orders tonight,\" he said as he fumbled to find the receipt in his pocket. \"It's alright. As long as it's still hot,\" I replied with a small smile, taking the bag from him. He nodded and handed me the receipt. \"Your total is 18.99.\" I dug through my pockets for my wallet and handed him a twenty dollar bill. \"Keep the change,\" I said, closing the door behind me and making my way to the kitchen. I opened the pizza box and took a deep breath in. Hot, cheesy goodness wafted up to my nose. I couldn't wait to dig in. But as I reached for a slice, I noticed something was wrong. The crust was burnt to a crisp. The cheese was sloppy, and some of the toppings had slid off. I groaned, feeling disappointed. \"I knew I should have just made my own pizza,\" I muttered to myself. But then I thought, 'Maybe there's something I can salvage from this.' I decided to scrape off the toppings and put them in a separate dish.

We had a lot of orders tonight,\" he said as he fumbled to find the receipt in his pocket. \"It's alright. As long as it's still hot,\" I replied with a small smile, taking the bag from him.

The crust was burnt to a crisp. The cheese was sloppy, and some of the toppings had slid off. I groaned, feeling disappointed. \"I knew I should have just made my own pizza,\" I muttered to myself.

I don't need fancy things.\" Then why did you want to follow your \"foodie\" heart and eat at these places you know I couldn't afford? I work minimum wage. Minimum fucking wage. And you know what? I've been poor my whole life. So I would have really, really liked to save some money for a change. But no, I blew several paychecks on you, and you decided to break up with me for what?

{"original_text": "It was Silvia's and my 2nd anniversary dating together. Despite a really rocky start and some strange moments, things seemed to be going really well. Our interests, temperments, and even our crazy sides matched. We met at an anime convention. She was looking over the latest re-releases of Battle Princess Mintaka. I don't know why, but I felt compelled to strike up a conversation. Well, it was probably the fact she was a fiery red-haired, piercing green eyed, freckled, glasses wearing, anime-interested young woman with a figure that my baser instincts had only theorized could exist. I may have been a goofy, tall and bulky dork..... But..... I have a near encyclopedic knowledge of Battle Princess Mintaka on my side. Fate may have been throwing me a pity softball on this one, but damned if I wasn't going to swing for the fences on it. So..... Two years, a whole host of convention going, and a lot of learning experiences..... We were still together and I didn't see anything stopping us. She got her dissertation together and defended it. With the Ph. D. in hand and some noted papers published, the university couldn't wait for her to apply for some open positions they'd been dying to fill. I was able to pull a few strings to get into the IT department with the help of an old friend who managed to find himself there after a big career change. So..... The next big step I figured was seeing if she wanted to move in with me. I managed to get a ridiculous price on a foreclosure property, and I had been living there for some time. Silvia is practically here all the time and the rent for anything nicer than a single bedroom apartment around this town is ridiculous. So, 2nd anniversery, I figured..... Why not ask? We decided to keep it simple this anniversary. Giving some craziness that happened during the first one, that Silvia still doesn't feel comfortable talking about..... Simpler is better. A nice day trip to some parts of the state we hadn't seen before, lunch at some place we found on the web, going over to the theatre to see the new Deadpool movie (Her suggestion, I love this woman), and dinner at the usual nice place we go to went we need a little fancy dining to bring up our spirits. We are hanging out on the couch. She's curled up with a blanket in my arms. She looks happy and content. Seems like a successful anniversary so far. I was tempted to put off asking her about moving in. I really didn't want to give Murphy's Law a chance to throw everything for a loop. But, hell..... You got ta know sometime right? \"Hey, Silvia?\" \"Yes?\" \"I was thinking..... You are over here a lot anyway, you need a place to stay in the future, and well..... We've been together for two years. If you are comfortable with it, I'd really like to see how we are together, living in the same place.\" Okay. Logical reasoning presented, reason for the question revealed, and option to gracefully back out allowed. Worst case probably, \"No, let's give it some more time.\" Best case: \"Hell yes!\" The sudden slight shudder of Silvia snapping to full consciousness and the odd feeling of the room's energy changing was not in any of the predicted outcomes. Oh shit, I'd somehow hit a critical snag. Silvia slowly pushes herself up and sits upright on the couch. The blanket slips away and she just sits there in uncomfortable contemplation. This is not good. She's normally a very confident and expressive woman. Seeing her this subdued and nervous..... This was shades of the last anniversary right here. I'm not going to allow that to happen again. \"Hey, there's no pressure or anything. I just figured it might be something to think about. I think everything is going great between you and me. I've got a place, you are looking for a place. And there's no one else who I could think of that'd make this place more of a home for the both of us. If it's too much to ask, just say so. And we'll think about it later and A meek and saddened voice creeps from Silvia, \"I want to. sniff I really do. I just- I just- I just don't know if you'd accept me.\" Okay. I'm confused. \"Accept you? Have I not accepted you before? I accept you as you are before me. There's nothing I can think of that \"I'm a demon.\" \"A what?\" \"Demon.\" \"You get a bit difficult some times, but you're hardly a Silvia shoots up from the couch, turns around to me, and holds her arms to the sides with tears in her eyes, \"sniff I'll show you. It's best for the both of us to make it quick.\" The facade fades away. Silvia's long red hair, turns a silvery white. Her skin goes from the freckled pale to a gray with darker gray markings. Two swept back horns anchored in the sides of her forehead appear. But as strange as what has changed is, she still has that same figure, that beautful face, and the piercing green eyes that are more radiant than ever. \"You know me as Silvia Carter. I'm..... I'm..... I'm Silvianistria Nostromandeus of the 3rd Order of Orion..... Former servant and advisor to the Battlemistress and Queen of the 3rd Order of Orion Lady Oriana Nox.\" She looks at me, expecting a certain reaction. I gaze into those same eyes. She's scared. It actually all makes sense to me now. We got A LOT to talk about. And she's not the only one with a few secrets to tell, but first things first. I take her hands into mine and never breaking eye contact with hers. I crack that smirk that she hates to love, \"If you are the same woman that was nearly late to her dissertation defense because of an argument with me about how there is no way that Battle Princess Mintaka could have used the Gauntlet of the Guardian to defeat Lord Izo..... Then you are the same woman I've loved and will always love.\" This isn't the reaction she expected. After a brief moment of confusion, I witness one of the few moments she's ever been delighted to be absolutely wrong. She gracefully collapses into an embrace around my neck, one of her horns glances me in forehead with a light thunk. That'll take some getting used to. We hold each other and eventually start airing out all our laundry. A few hours later...... \"So, that's me. Once an undisputed master advisor, mage, and alchemist to one of the Queens to the Dark Realms. Then Queen Nox decided to listen to that idiot Wester and got her aass royally kicked and banished to realms that even the darkest mages dare not even chart. Out of work and trapped on Earth. Thankfully, certain organizations offered me a chance at a life here on this planet with giving them a bunch of insider info.\" \"I always wondered how they got all that info in those Battle Princess Mintaka books.\" \"Yah, I kind of got into them while trying to see how they portrayed all us on the Dark Realm side.\" \"They were pretty kind with your portrayal.\" \"They still cleaned up the rest of the group. Great gods, most of Queen Nox's crew were complete perverts. I was so glad that Lord Izo got absolutely annihilated by Mintaka. He ran back to the Dark Realms and I haven't heard a thing about him since.\" \"Grr..... Fucker deserved it.\" \"You really don't like that guy. Every time that name gets brought up you ALWAYS emit this aura of spite and ire, that I never sense from you any other time.\" Shit. Well..... she's got me. Let's get all the laundry hanging out. \"There's a reason. And as a bonus, it'll prove you right.\" This has her attention now. I feel her leaning in and her eyes trying to decipher what I was going to say. \"The Gauntlet of the Guardian didn't leave Lord Izo and jump to Mintaka.\" \"Yes. Because the Gauntlet will only jump on its own to someone trying to defend who they love and care for in their time of greatest need.\" \"Yes..... Ah..... Those scars on my body, those weren't from electrical arcs. They were I don't get a chance to complete my sentence before Silvia is reaching under my shirt and feeling the various scarring I got a long time ago. \"Holy shit! These are magical blast burn scars! The residual magic is so weak I could never pick it up while maintaining my illusion and shape change spell. Now, I can sense it all..... By the gods! How did you live through this Silvia hands held my right arm. Her fingertips sweep around. She's finally sensing the residual magic of what was on there. \"You wore the..... THE..... Gauntlet of the Guardian?!\" \"Yes.\" \"The bystander that attempted to save Mintaka and friends in issue 126 where Mintaka finally confronts Lord Izo?\" \"Me.\" \"The gauntlet went to?\" \"Me.\" \"Because WHO were you defending?\" \"My little sister.\" \" ............!!!\" \"Yes.\" I think it'll be a LONG while before I see that degree of shock, confusion, and bewilderment in Silvia's face. And I really hope I'm not the one to cause it next time. I see her bite her lower lip and flash a concerned look my way. \"Do you still want me to come over to your family's place this Thanksgiving? That might be REALLY awkward..... and possibly dangerous.\" \"Don't worry. My sister wasn't good with the sensory powers before, and she hasn't used them in at least ten years. We should be fine.\" \"But, what about Horus her magical cat?!\" \"Don't worry. Horus and I go back. I've helped him out a number of times. He'll keep it quiet.\" Plus, the bastard owes me a big one after nearly getting caught by the magical equivalent of the FBI trying to move his stash of Star Hemp to a new safe place. We both lay on the couch, back to that comfortable and content point again. \"So..... you okay with moving in?\" \"Ha. Yes. I'm actually looking forward to it now.\" \"Cool. Got to admit, it was nice getting everything out there.\" \"No kidding. Strange world we live in. I'm just glad I can finally drop the shape change spell around you.\" \"Speaking of which, you wouldn't happen to have THAT uniform still?\" All I am able to get from Silvia is that evil little grin.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "It was Silvia's and my 2nd anniversary dating together. Despite a really rocky start and some strange moments, things seemed to be going really well. Our interests, temperments, and even our crazy sides matched. We met at an anime convention. She was looking over the latest re-releases of Battle Princess Mintaka. I don't know why, but I felt compelled to strike up a conversation. Well, it was probably the fact she was a fiery red-haired, piercing green eyed, freckled, glasses wearing, anime-interested young woman with a figure that my baser instincts had only theorized could exist. I may have been a goofy, tall and bulky dork..... But..... I have a near encyclopedic knowledge of Battle Princess Mintaka on my side. Fate may have been throwing me a pity softball on this one, but damned if I wasn't going to swing for the fences on it. So..... Two years, a whole host of convention going, and a lot of learning experiences..... We were still together and I didn't see anything stopping us. She got her dissertation together and defended it. With the Ph. D. in hand and some noted papers published, the university couldn't wait for her to apply for some open positions they'd been dying to fill. I was able to pull a few strings to get into the IT department with the help of an old friend who managed to find himself there after a big career change. So..... The next big step I figured was seeing if she wanted to move in with me. I managed to get a ridiculous price on a foreclosure property, and I had been living there for some time. Silvia is practically here all the time and the rent for anything nicer than a single bedroom apartment around this town is ridiculous. So, 2nd anniversery, I figured..... Why not ask? We decided to keep it simple this anniversary. Giving some craziness that happened during the first one, that Silvia still doesn't feel comfortable talking about..... Simpler is better. A nice day trip to some parts of the state we hadn't seen before, lunch at some place we found on the web, going over to the theatre to see the new Deadpool movie (Her suggestion, I love this woman), and dinner at the usual nice place we go to went we need a little fancy dining to bring up our spirits. We are hanging out on the couch. She's curled up with a blanket in my arms. She looks happy and content. Seems like a successful anniversary so far. I was tempted to put off asking her about moving in. I really didn't want to give Murphy's Law a chance to throw everything for a loop. But, hell..... You got ta know sometime right? \"Hey, Silvia?\" \"Yes?\" \"I was thinking..... You are over here a lot anyway, you need a place to stay in the future, and well..... We've been together for two years. If you are comfortable with it, I'd really like to see how we are together, living in the same place.\" Okay. Logical reasoning presented, reason for the question revealed, and option to gracefully back out allowed. Worst case probably, \"No, let's give it some more time.\" Best case: \"Hell yes!\" The sudden slight shudder of Silvia snapping to full consciousness and the odd feeling of the room's energy changing was not in any of the predicted outcomes. Oh shit, I'd somehow hit a critical snag. Silvia slowly pushes herself up and sits upright on the couch. The blanket slips away and she just sits there in uncomfortable contemplation. This is not good. She's normally a very confident and expressive woman. Seeing her this subdued and nervous..... This was shades of the last anniversary right here. I'm not going to allow that to happen again. \"Hey, there's no pressure or anything. I just figured it might be something to think about. I think everything is going great between you and me. I've got a place, you are looking for a place. And there's no one else who I could think of that'd make this place more of a home for the both of us. If it's too much to ask, just say so. And we'll think about it later and A meek and saddened voice creeps from Silvia, \"I want to. sniff I really do. I just- I just- I just don't know if you'd accept me.\" Okay. I'm confused. \"Accept you? Have I not accepted you before? I accept you as you are before me. There's nothing I can think of that \"I'm a demon.\" \"A what?\" \"Demon.\" \"You get a bit difficult some times, but you're hardly a Silvia shoots up from the couch, turns around to me, and holds her arms to the sides with tears in her eyes, \"sniff I'll show you. It's best for the both of us to make it quick.\" The facade fades away. Silvia's long red hair, turns a silvery white. Her skin goes from the freckled pale to a gray with darker gray markings. Two swept back horns anchored in the sides of her forehead appear. But as strange as what has changed is, she still has that same figure, that beautful face, and the piercing green eyes that are more radiant than ever. \"You know me as Silvia Carter. I'm..... I'm..... I'm Silvianistria Nostromandeus of the 3rd Order of Orion..... Former servant and advisor to the Battlemistress and Queen of the 3rd Order of Orion Lady Oriana Nox.\" She looks at me, expecting a certain reaction. I gaze into those same eyes. She's scared. It actually all makes sense to me now. We got A LOT to talk about. And she's not the only one with a few secrets to tell, but first things first. I take her hands into mine and never breaking eye contact with hers. I crack that smirk that she hates to love, \"If you are the same woman that was nearly late to her dissertation defense because of an argument with me about how there is no way that Battle Princess Mintaka could have used the Gauntlet of the Guardian to defeat Lord Izo..... Then you are the same woman I've loved and will always love.\" This isn't the reaction she expected. After a brief moment of confusion, I witness one of the few moments she's ever been delighted to be absolutely wrong. She gracefully collapses into an embrace around my neck, one of her horns glances me in forehead with a light thunk. That'll take some getting used to. We hold each other and eventually start airing out all our laundry. A few hours later...... \"So, that's me. Once an undisputed master advisor, mage, and alchemist to one of the Queens to the Dark Realms. Then Queen Nox decided to listen to that idiot Wester and got her aass royally kicked and banished to realms that even the darkest mages dare not even chart. Out of work and trapped on Earth. Thankfully, certain organizations offered me a chance at a life here on this planet with giving them a bunch of insider info.\" \"I always wondered how they got all that info in those Battle Princess Mintaka books.\" \"Yah, I kind of got into them while trying to see how they portrayed all us on the Dark Realm side.\" \"They were pretty kind with your portrayal.\" \"They still cleaned up the rest of the group. Great gods, most of Queen Nox's crew were complete perverts. I was so glad that Lord Izo got absolutely annihilated by Mintaka. He ran back to the Dark Realms and I haven't heard a thing about him since.\" \"Grr..... Fucker deserved it.\" \"You really don't like that guy. Every time that name gets brought up you ALWAYS emit this aura of spite and ire, that I never sense from you any other time.\" Shit. Well..... she's got me. Let's get all the laundry hanging out. \"There's a reason. And as a bonus, it'll prove you right.\" This has her attention now. I feel her leaning in and her eyes trying to decipher what I was going to say. \"The Gauntlet of the Guardian didn't leave Lord Izo and jump to Mintaka.\" \"Yes. Because the Gauntlet will only jump on its own to someone trying to defend who they love and care for in their time of greatest need.\" \"Yes..... Ah..... Those scars on my body, those weren't from electrical arcs. They were I don't get a chance to complete my sentence before Silvia is reaching under my shirt and feeling the various scarring I got a long time ago. \"Holy shit! These are magical blast burn scars! The residual magic is so weak I could never pick it up while maintaining my illusion and shape change spell. Now, I can sense it all..... By the gods! How did you live through this Silvia hands held my right arm. Her fingertips sweep around. She's finally sensing the residual magic of what was on there. \"You wore the..... THE..... Gauntlet of the Guardian?!\" \"Yes.\" \"The bystander that attempted to save Mintaka and friends in issue 126 where Mintaka finally confronts Lord Izo?\" \"Me.\" \"The gauntlet went to?\" \"Me.\" \"Because WHO were you defending?\" \"My little sister.\" \" ............!!!\" \"Yes.\" I think it'll be a LONG while before I see that degree of shock, confusion, and bewilderment in Silvia's face. And I really hope I'm not the one to cause it next time. I see her bite her lower lip and flash a concerned look my way. \"Do you still want me to come over to your family's place this Thanksgiving? That might be REALLY awkward..... and possibly dangerous.\" \"Don't worry. My sister wasn't good with the sensory powers before, and she hasn't used them in at least ten years.

Still got enough fuel to get back to orbit. Sara is complaining about how warm it is. I kinda agree with her. While we seem to be in an oasis right now, surrounding us all is just desert. I mean, we knew it was dry but the clouds were too thick to make anything out. Anyway. We're gon na check the composition of the oasis plants, then get some rest. 42 hour day tomorrow. 30 of it is sun. Day 3, April 24th, 2065 Okay, so the plants in this area seem to be angiosperms, with apparently wind as the preferred transfer method. Makes sense, there's an almost constant breeze. Don't know where it'd go, though, apart from here. Water is fine and safe to drink. Seems to be a spring. We're getting the fusion engine ready, but until then rationed power. Reason why I'm writing, actually. Long time since I have. I remember my dad telling me that once they used to actually write in classes. Heh, good old days. Tomorrow we're gon na go on an expedition, see if we can get anywhere. We're preparing some buggies to travel about. We'll use liquid fuels for now, while electricity gets set up. Day 4, April 25th, 2065 Okay, so me and Mike are heading out. The rest of the crew is going to take care of setting shit up, while we go dune buggying. As Mike's driving, I can write. Outside the oasis, the temperature picks up a hell of a lot, up by 10 to 15 degrees, at least. It's already something like 80 in the shade. Kinda wishing I stayed back now. At least there's no wind to blow sand in my face. Day 5, April 26th, 2065 Okay, so me and Mike are fucking screwed, along with finding the reason why the wind had dropped. Sandstorms. I swear to god, tornados were fucking everywhere. We set up emergency shelter, and we're kinda waiting it out. The sound of the storm has stopped. Not the storm itself, though. The sand's burying us, I think. Day 7, April 28th, 2065 Finally, it's stopped. We checked the plexiglass windows, and we know for a fact we are buried. 10 feet, I think. seems pretty hard packed. Mike's MacGyvering some kind of drill together, so we can get out. I think the shelter's a loss. There's no way we could get it out. Oh well, time to dig. Day 8, April 29th, 2065 We made it. Oh god, I have never wanted to feel the wind on my face and the warmth again. We spent 20 hours, digging straight up. We got to a point where it was actually raining down, but we didn't give a fuck, we just climbed up and up and up, sand in our hair and eyes, looking for the cloudy sky. We got everything out of the tent. The buggy is a loss. Mike's trying to get the GPS unit to work. I think the cloud layer is interfering. We also sent up a flare, so we'll see what happens. Day 10, April 30th, 2065 Nothing. While we didn't want to climb back down to the tent, we had to during night. It's fucking freezing. The tent keeps some warmth, at least. GPS is down, and the flares are out. I think we're just going to have to hike back the way we came. We did lay down Helium Markers, so that's good. Thank god for all this equipment. We're running low on food, though. Got enough for about a week, now. Water's good, we've got 2 weeks of that. We're gon na start walking soon. Day 11, May 1st, 2065 Okay, so we hiked for about 25 hours, thanks to the sunlight (so fucking hot) and we managed to build some kind of sand igloo for the night (so fucking cold). Our water is really dropping quickly, and we are getting tired, fast. Thank god we found the Helium Markers. Though. I've never been happier to see one of those red and blue motherfuckers. We're following them along, and we've past 15 by now. Mike says we've got about 30 more to go. This is really taking a toll on him. I mean, he's a pretty heavy guy. He's an engineer, not Markel Louis, 2060 Gold Medalist Long Distance Runner. I feel sorry for him. I try to keep him on the up, though. I'm gon na get the sleep I can now, and try to cover as much ground as possible. Day 13, May 3rd, 2065 MOTHERFUCKER. One of those fucking'storm-proof' Helium Markers got snapped. We're fucked. We put a 5km distance between each of them, and the one we were going to was in the middle of a fucking crater. We're gon na try to follow our steps out. This really has Mike down. Shit, he ain't doing well at all. I mean, yeah, he's lost like 15 lbs, but he is losing water way to quickly. I estimated, and our water is only gon na last 2 more days. Off we go, I guess. Day 14, May 4th, 2065 We ran out of food today. I didn't realize till I reached into the bag that was already empty. We only have a few more liters of water, as well. We got back to our previous Marker, and we're camping there for tonight. On the bright side, I found some actual life on this planet! A huge, 10ft long snake, just slithering around, with a HUGE bulb. That was dinner. We both ate well, and turned out the bulb was filled with water. We'll be okay. Day 15, May 5th, 2065 Okay, so we walked. We have a general idea of where we're going. We know that the missing Marker in the crater is 5km away from last night's Marker. We know the one far away is about 7km away. Using some triangulation magic, we found where we had to go. Hopefully this works out. I gave Mike a larger ration of water. Hopefully he stays up. Day 16, May 6th, 2065 It's not there. We couldn't find it. Not even a severed rope. Did we go to the wrong place? Was the crater not actually a Marker point at all? The sandstorm changed this place so much. I have no sense of bearing. Mike's not taking it well. We're kinda lost here. I guess we're gon na hike back to our campsite, I guess. Day 17, May 7th, 2065 We can't find it. We can't. I can't. Oh fuck oh fuck. We can't find our camp. It's gone. We know it's the same area. It looks the same, has the same mountain in the distance, but no Marker, no camp, no fucking nothing. We only have a day worth of food left. We have no more water. I need to find one of those snake things again, or we're dead. Day 20, May 20th, 2065 Mike is on his last stand right now. He can't handle the lack of food, lack of shade, lack of water. Neither can I, but he's suffering. I caught another snake, much smaller this time, and gave it to him. He ate it raw. Right then and there. I was disgusted. And hungry. So hungry. Day 25, May 25th, 2065 Mike's dying. I think that snake he ate was poisonous. he's green, throwing up, and not moving. We can't afford to waste this time. But he'll die tonight. I know it. I wonder what I'm going to do. Day 26, May 26th, 2065 Mike died last night. I was so hungry..... Day 27 I have to keep moving. Can't think on what I did. If I keep moving, maybe I'll find the Oasis, right? Yeah, then I can finally lie back in the shade, sip on that bottle of 20-year-old Royale whiskey I smuggled on. That'd be great. Day 30 Sand. It's everywhere. It's everything. Sand, made of silicon, made of protons and neutrons and electrons, which also make me up. By that logic, I'm sand, right? Day It's really warm today. I think I'll take off my suit. Night It's cold. I buried myself in sand. Still cold. Day 35, 4th June, 2065 I see it! It's in the distance. Fucking finally. Running hurts a hell of a lot, despite me feeling lighter. Fuck, I need to take a shower. At least I've got some great thighs from this walking. Ugh, am I tired. I'll dive in that spring, surprise everyone. About 100 yards away now. Let's go. End Everything is sand. I'm sand. The Oasis is sand. There is no Oasis, just sand. It's so warm, like being in a fuzzy blanket. I'll sleep now. - Holy fuck, 7766 characters of writing. I felt that ending get to me.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "OASIS - Day 1, April 22nd, 2065 Alright. We all managed to touch down without any actual problems. Doesn't seem to be any damage on the ship. Landing gear is okay. Still got enough fuel to get back to orbit. Sara is complaining about how warm it is. I kinda agree with her. While we seem to be in an oasis right now, surrounding us all is just desert. I mean, we knew it was dry but the clouds were too thick to make anything out. Anyway. We're gon na check the composition of the oasis plants, then get some rest. 42 hour day tomorrow. 30 of it is sun. Day 3, April 24th, 2065 Okay, so the plants in this area seem to be angiosperms, with apparently wind as the preferred transfer method. Makes sense, there's an almost constant breeze. Don't know where it'd go, though, apart from here. Water is fine and safe to drink. Seems to be a spring. We're getting the fusion engine ready, but until then rationed power. Reason why I'm writing, actually. Long time since I have. I remember my dad telling me that once they used to actually write in classes. Heh, good old days. Tomorrow we're gon na go on an expedition, see if we can get anywhere. We're preparing some buggies to travel about. We'll use liquid fuels for now, while electricity gets set up. Day 4, April 25th, 2065 Okay, so me and Mike are heading out. The rest of the crew is going to take care of setting shit up, while we go dune buggying. As Mike's driving, I can write. Outside the oasis, the temperature picks up a hell of a lot, up by 10 to 15 degrees, at least. It's already something like 80 in the shade. Kinda wishing I stayed back now. At least there's no wind to blow sand in my face. Day 5, April 26th, 2065 Okay, so me and Mike are fucking screwed, along with finding the reason why the wind had dropped. Sandstorms. I swear to god, tornados were fucking everywhere. We set up emergency shelter, and we're kinda waiting it out. The sound of the storm has stopped. Not the storm itself, though. The sand's burying us, I think. Day 7, April 28th, 2065 Finally, it's stopped. We checked the plexiglass windows, and we know for a fact we are buried. 10 feet, I think. seems pretty hard packed. Mike's MacGyvering some kind of drill together, so we can get out. I think the shelter's a loss. There's no way we could get it out. Oh well, time to dig. Day 8, April 29th, 2065 We made it. Oh god, I have never wanted to feel the wind on my face and the warmth again. We spent 20 hours, digging straight up. We got to a point where it was actually raining down, but we didn't give a fuck, we just climbed up and up and up, sand in our hair and eyes, looking for the cloudy sky. We got everything out of the tent. The buggy is a loss. Mike's trying to get the GPS unit to work. I think the cloud layer is interfering. We also sent up a flare, so we'll see what happens. Day 10, April 30th, 2065 Nothing. While we didn't want to climb back down to the tent, we had to during night. It's fucking freezing. The tent keeps some warmth, at least. GPS is down, and the flares are out. I think we're just going to have to hike back the way we came. We did lay down Helium Markers, so that's good. Thank god for all this equipment. We're running low on food, though. Got enough for about a week, now. Water's good, we've got 2 weeks of that. We're gon na start walking soon. Day 11, May 1st, 2065 Okay, so we hiked for about 25 hours, thanks to the sunlight (so fucking hot) and we managed to build some kind of sand igloo for the night (so fucking cold). Our water is really dropping quickly, and we are getting tired, fast. Thank god we found the Helium Markers. Though. I've never been happier to see one of those red and blue motherfuckers. We're following them along, and we've past 15 by now. Mike says we've got about 30 more to go. This is really taking a toll on him. I mean, he's a pretty heavy guy. He's an engineer, not Markel Louis, 2060 Gold Medalist Long Distance Runner. I feel sorry for him. I try to keep him on the up, though. I'm gon na get the sleep I can now, and try to cover as much ground as possible. Day 13, May 3rd, 2065 MOTHERFUCKER. One of those fucking'storm-proof' Helium Markers got snapped. We're fucked. We put a 5km distance between each of them, and the one we were going to was in the middle of a fucking crater. We're gon na try to follow our steps out. This really has Mike down. Shit, he ain't doing well at all. I mean, yeah, he's lost like 15 lbs, but he is losing water way to quickly. I estimated, and our water is only gon na last 2 more days. Off we go, I guess. Day 14, May 4th, 2065 We ran out of food today. I didn't realize till I reached into the bag that was already empty. We only have a few more liters of water, as well. We got back to our previous Marker, and we're camping there for tonight. On the bright side, I found some actual life on this planet! A huge, 10ft long snake, just slithering around, with a HUGE bulb. That was dinner. We both ate well, and turned out the bulb was filled with water. We'll be okay. Day 15, May 5th, 2065 Okay, so we walked. We have a general idea of where we're going. We know that the missing Marker in the crater is 5km away from last night's Marker. We know the one far away is about 7km away. Using some triangulation magic, we found where we had to go. Hopefully this works out. I gave Mike a larger ration of water. Hopefully he stays up. Day 16, May 6th, 2065 It's not there. We couldn't find it. Not even a severed rope. Did we go to the wrong place? Was the crater not actually a Marker point at all? The sandstorm changed this place so much. I have no sense of bearing. Mike's not taking it well. We're kinda lost here. I guess we're gon na hike back to our campsite, I guess. Day 17, May 7th, 2065 We can't find it. We can't. I can't. Oh fuck oh fuck. We can't find our camp. It's gone. We know it's the same area. It looks the same, has the same mountain in the distance, but no Marker, no camp, no fucking nothing. We only have a day worth of food left. We have no more water. I need to find one of those snake things again, or we're dead. Day 20, May 20th, 2065 Mike is on his last stand right now. He can't handle the lack of food, lack of shade, lack of water. Neither can I, but he's suffering. I caught another snake, much smaller this time, and gave it to him. He ate it raw. Right then and there. I was disgusted. And hungry. So hungry. Day 25, May 25th, 2065 Mike's dying. I think that snake he ate was poisonous. he's green, throwing up, and not moving. We can't afford to waste this time. But he'll die tonight. I know it. I wonder what I'm going to do. Day 26, May 26th, 2065 Mike died last night. I was so hungry..... Day 27 I have to keep moving. Can't think on what I did. If I keep moving, maybe I'll find the Oasis, right? Yeah, then I can finally lie back in the shade, sip on that bottle of 20-year-old Royale whiskey I smuggled on. That'd be great. Day 30 Sand.

He could tell none of this was real, he'd grown up in real forests, and they were full of the sounds of wind, wildlife, everything had some rhyme or reason for making the sound it did. This place? Even the river didn't make the right sound. It's like they turned the volume of everything down in intensity. It felt unnatural.

Shit, maybe it's Ace, he's always been kind of a big lumbering beast.\" Suddenly, and sure enough, Ace burst from the brush on the other side of the river and rushed into the water, dunking his head and taking long, deep gulps. It didn't seem like he'd spotted them. Just then, something clicked in Bobby's head. \"Frank. Get down from the tree. Ace is in the water. I think if you try hard enough, you can cook him.\" \"What?\" \"We're in here to kill, Frank. I did my job, I spotted someone. Now go do yours.\" \"What? What? My job is to cook the food, Bobby! You're the fighting expert, YOU go down there!\" Frank whispered furtively. Bobby grabbed him by the collar. \"Stick. Your hands. In the river. Cook it up like you were cooking noodles. You said you can heat water, right?\" \"I mean, I think! I don't know the specifics, man. I've tried it on everything and if it's got water in it, I can get it warm. The noodles only work because there's more water than noodles in the pot, but that's a lot of water man. That's a river.\" \"Listen, Ace has super strength, not fucking super vision or hearing or anything. He'll never see you coming.

Worth a shot. I'm a dead man, anyway.\" He climbed down from the tree as quietly as he could and crept to the edge of the bushes on the riverbank. His heart was pounding, he'd never killed before, but what choice did he have? He might even have to kill Bobby if someone else didn't get to him first. He'd been chosen at random, he never had a taste for violence, just fire. His palms started sweating, and without thinking he heated them. A flash of steam rose from the bush he was hiding in, and he cursed quietly. Ace took notice of the movement and squinted in Franks direction, then dove in and started racing across the river, with the incredible speed of a super strong fucking dolphin or something! Frank panicked and burst out towards the water, hands extended. Ace was almost across, if Frank didn't try something now, he'd surely be broken in two. He'd seen it, from a distance. Ace had literally pulled one of the other contestants apart. It was sickening. He got to the rivers edge just as Ace was surfacing only a few feet away, murder in his eyes, grinning like death.

Normally when adventurers make their way into my sanctum they come in groups, set traps, and blather on and on about righteousness. It is exceedingly rare to to find one a cut above the rest. \"What makes this ring valuable to yourself more than me?\" I asked with some mild curiosity. \"It is a magical ring that when worn can transform you into what I desire most.

Again its hair struck my eyes, long and golden obviously groomed for many years and kept free of tangles, blades, and briars. \"I desire but one thing. Cut your golden locks and add them to my hold.

I must admit in my old age I have forgotten where every individual item has settled in my hold. The human took out a small scroll and read from it words that were foreign to me. I heard the rustle of gold coins and a small brass ring with a ruby set upon it levitated out of the horde and into the air. Now was my chance. Quickly I began to transform into the form that I have avoided when possible. A tall slender black haired main with pale skin and long red robes. I snatched the ring out of the air and landed softly before the warrior. \"You can use it once I have taken my turn.\" I cackled. Slipping the ring on I immediately meditated on my own form, scales stronger than ever, breath hotter with teeth and claws sharper and longer than before yet years reset to that of young adulthood. I could feel the rings energy flowing through me and I closed my eyes. I felt my body rippling and strengthening..... stiffening? In horror I opened my eyes to see my body slowly changing into gold, from foot up it climbed. I quickly attempted to pull the ring off but my arms were already growing heavy and stiff. I looked to the human with such rage. \"What is this sorcery! I should have known not to trust a human.\" I sputtered. Already my lungs were stiffening and breath was becoming shallow. \"There was no deception on my part wyrm. It is transforming you into what I want the most.

I snatched the ring out of the air and landed softly before the warrior. \"You can use it once I have taken my turn.\" I cackled. Slipping the ring on I immediately meditated on my own form, scales stronger than ever, breath hotter with teeth and claws sharper and longer than before yet years reset to that of young adulthood. I could feel the rings energy flowing through me and I closed my eyes. I felt my body rippling and strengthening..... stiffening? In horror I opened my eyes to see my body slowly changing into gold, from foot up it climbed. I quickly attempted to pull the ring off but my arms were already growing heavy and stiff. I looked to the human with such rage. \"What is this sorcery! I should have known not to trust a human.\" I sputtered. Already my lungs were stiffening and breath was becoming shallow. \"There was no deception on my part wyrm. It is transforming you into what I want the most. A golden statue of a handsome man will go nicely in my new castle. You should pay more attention to grammar and syntax.\" The final moments of a thousand years was to see the face of that dreadful women smiling in the torchlight."}

{"original_text": "Her cold wet nose nuzzled it's way into my clasped hands. As I reached out, wrapping my arms around her thick fur coat, the wet tissue fell from my hand to the floor. Typically this would of caused a riot for the 6 month old Lab; a signal for her to begin a new game of \"catch me if you can,\" but today was different. As the mascara streaked down my face, creating rivers of black tears; Nellie did not move and as I collapsed onto the floor, she gently fell next to me. Maybe it was her own love for Tom that gave her a deeper understanding of my pain. He had chosen her and driven the 3 hours to surprise me on my birthday. Tom had been the one who walked and played with her day after day as I lay in bed crippled with sadness after finding out I was unable to bare children. And although Tom took many business trips, Nellie clearly understood this trip was different. She understood that he was never coming home and yet her strength in supporting me was unaltered and altruistic. The months went by and Nellie became my best friend. While our love for Tom initially brought us together, it was force of fate that made me realize Nellie was my saving grace. It was her undying acceptance that pushed my hand into accepting myself, and it was her unfaltering love that provided me with hope. My desire to have children would never leave me but the void was filled by that little black lab, and she gladly played the part of my furry, four legged baby. Almost giddily I bought steaks at the deli, tonight for dinner we would celebrate Nellie's second birthday. I pictured her big brown eyes lighting up when she heard the meat hit the skillet, and her leaning ever so patiently against my leg as I finished cooking it. My joyful daydream quickly diminished as I rounded the corner to my small house. Something felt wrong. Nearing the front door I noticed it was slightly ajar. As my heart began to race I called out to her. My mind panicking, I reassured myself that Nellie would soon come bounding out to greet me; after all she was never one to wander away and was well trained to always stay in the confines of our front yard. My stomach churned as I opened the door and called for her once again. Nothing. The rest of the night was a blur. The thieves had ransacked my home, taking TVs, jewelry and of course what petty cash they could find. As I picked up my belongings I realized that the only missing thing I cared about was Nellie. Why would they take my dog? What were they doing to her? Had she been tired of being left alone while I worked and gladly followed them out of my life? I found myself crippled in my sorrows once again. This time I had nothing left. I had never been part of a family and was not quick to make friends. I had Tom and Nellie; now they were both gone. I found a bottle of whiskey in the cupboard and sat down to drown my sorrows. Hungover and depressed the next day I called into work. They could find someone else to write the news, I had a date with daytime soaps and a bottle of Jack. And while I knew this was only a temporary fix, I also knew that my mind would be unable to think of anything except how much I missed those big brown eyes. Months went by and each day got a little easier. Although no one could replace Tom, I even remarried a great man named Alex. It was a whirlwind romance that helped heal my heart from the devastating losses. I threw myself into my career and was quickly moving up the journalism ladder. When I uncovered what I believed to be an embezzlement scandal at the County funded drug rehabilitation center \"Renew\" I was thrilled. Of course this would be a tragedy for our community but I felt championed in my position as expose writer. This was not a story that I could half ass and I made it my duty to get every detail. I could barely sit still as I sat in the lobby of Renew waiting to meet with it's director. The bell on the front door would jingle as nurses and visitors funneled in and out of the building. In my own world, I barely acknowledged their presence until a wet cold nose nuzzled it's way under my hand, bumping it off the paper as I wrote. Glancing down I saw nothing but beautiful brown eyes staring up at me. \"Get over here, Angel!\" A young man pulled on the other end of the leash. \"I'm real sorry mam' she's not usually up in other peoples business but I guess she ain't afraid to bother you!\" I stared in disbelief. It was Nellie, there was no doubt in my mind. I reached out my hand to touch her, as I did she let out a happy whimper. Immediately dropping my journal I kneeled onto the floor to hug her. Tears filled my eyes as I turned to the young man. Trying to find the right words I studied him. He couldn't have been older than 25 but his face bore the marks of many struggles. His over sized clothes reaked of cigarette smoke. He gave me an awkward smile. \"I guess you like dogs huh?\" he half stated, half asked. \"Where did you get this dog?\" was all I could choke out. \"Someone gave her to me, why do you care?\" he seemed agitated by my quick interest and overwhelming love for his dog. As he started to pull on the leash I quickly came gathered my thoughts and backed off a little bit. Nellie nudged my hand again as I asked; \"Sorry I was just wondering where you got this incredible dog?\" His face softened and he relented. \"I used to be a patient here, someone found this poor pup in a drug house. They brought her here as a therapy dog. I don't know if we saved her or she saved me, but cause of her I ain't had any slip ups in 6 months now!\" Just as quickly as my heart had began racing my stomach began to sink. Here was my sweet Nellie, my best friend and yet no longer mine. \"Hey lady since ya'll like each other you think that you could watch her while I go talk to the lady at the desk? They make me fill out all this freakin paperwork just so I can bring her to my meetings\" I nodded.

{"original_text": "David pauses in the waves and turns to look at me with a wrinkled nose. \"Christ, Claire, seriously?\" The grease runs from my fingertips down my slender wrists, glistening rivers of cooking fat that tickle the fine hairs on the undersides of my forearms. I take another bite of the hamburger and let out the tiniest of grunts. \"But Dave, \" I exclaim, through a half-mouthful of ground meat. \"Goddamn. It's good. \" \"You're polluting the ocean,\" he says, disapproving. His hair rustles gently in the breeze. \"You're gon na..... I dunno. Kill all the fish or some shit.\" I take a few buoyant steps in his direction. The sand is soft under my toes. \"That doesn't even...\" I pause for a moment, swallow the food in my mouth, continue. \"Make sense, David. They're fish. They probably want some of this burger-y action I've got goin' on here.\" I pop the last morsel into my mouth and start chewing. \"But they can't have any,\" I continue, winking. \"It's all mine. \" \"You're gon na get a cramp and drown,\" says David, turning away from me and glaring. \"You're supposed to wait, like, an hour or something.\" \"That's just a superstition!\" I tell him cheerfully, lurching forward and diving into the salt water. The ocean envelops me like a blanket; my blonde hair fans around me and every breath I take is laced with salt. Delicious. I love it. I let the tide carry me until the shore is a glistening yellow band in the distance. David is a few hundred feet to my right, diving towards the ocean floor for a few seconds at a time, emerging wet and glistening and powerful, like an animal being reborn. It is unbelievably sexy. After this I think we'll go straight back to our hotel room and The faintest suggestion of pressure on my palm. I go stiff in the water and pull my hand out from the waves. Ah, shit, I think, toes tingling, there's an animal out here. Oh, fuck. It better not be a fucking shark I swear to God My other hand, still warm and cocooned in the water, is abruptly pulled a few inches forward. I let out a strangled cry and lash out with my feet, but they don't hit anything. David is still underwater. He can't hear me. He can't see me. \"Oh my God.\" Kicking like I am I'm able to stay above the waves, but something has my arm. It's the strangest feeling, moist and rough all at once. Whatever it is the water is too murky to see. To my right, David emerges. \"David!\" I shout, and my voice is thin and reedy. \"You got ta help !\" Another tug on my arm. This time I can't fight it. I go under. For a moment my eyes sting and smart as they adjust to the gloom. Air bubbles stream from my nostrils. I squint and peer out through a fringe of dark eyelashes. It stares back at me. Oh God, oh God. The eyes. The eyes. Huge, massive, luminous discs that rise from the darkness below. Bigger than dinner plates, bigger than my goddamned head. Fixed on me with a dull sparkling intelligence behind them. Its head is so massive that I could lie across the forehead and have room to stretch my legs. Below it is a mammoth fleshy trunk of a neck and a vague approximation of a torso that stretches away into the darkness below. I don't even remember floating so far out. I can just about make out the rounded slope of a shoulder. Oh God, the arms must be meters in length, maybe longer. Oh God. Mermaid, I think. It smiles at me placidly, and in that smile are rows upon rows of jagged, pointed teeth. In between one set I can see a human arm waving sadly, fingers splayed and falling apart in the water, skin hanging loosely and floating with the current. Beyond the teeth is only darkness and a cavernous mouth so vast that I wouldn't be able to touch either cheek with both of my arms extended. The tongues come coiling from between bloodless lips, so many tongues, as thin and whip-like and delicate as the tongues of humans, scenting the air, stirring the water. One is wrapped around my wrist. As I watch, almost fascinated, it runs itself along one of the grease trails on my skin. It shudders, worm-like, and pulls a little tighter. I begin to descend. I'm thrashing now, screaming uselessly, and the air pours from my desperate lungs.

Even as I pass the first row of teeth I can see the eyes fixed on me, the savage stupid delight in them at the taste of something remembered and cherished.

EDIT: formatting", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "David pauses in the waves and turns to look at me with a wrinkled nose. \"Christ, Claire, seriously?\" The grease runs from my fingertips down my slender wrists, glistening rivers of cooking fat that tickle the fine hairs on the undersides of my forearms. I take another bite of the hamburger and let out the tiniest of grunts. \"But Dave, \" I exclaim, through a half-mouthful of ground meat. \"Goddamn. It's good. \" \"You're polluting the ocean,\" he says, disapproving. His hair rustles gently in the breeze. \"You're gon na..... I dunno. Kill all the fish or some shit.\" I take a few buoyant steps in his direction. The sand is soft under my toes. \"That doesn't even...\" I pause for a moment, swallow the food in my mouth, continue. \"Make sense, David. They're fish. They probably want some of this burger-y action I've got goin' on here.\" I pop the last morsel into my mouth and start chewing. \"But they can't have any,\" I continue, winking. \"It's all mine. \" \"You're gon na get a cramp and drown,\" says David, turning away from me and glaring. \"You're supposed to wait, like, an hour or something.\" \"That's just a superstition!\" I tell him cheerfully, lurching forward and diving into the salt water. The ocean envelops me like a blanket; my blonde hair fans around me and every breath I take is laced with salt. Delicious. I love it. I let the tide carry me until the shore is a glistening yellow band in the distance. David is a few hundred feet to my right, diving towards the ocean floor for a few seconds at a time, emerging wet and glistening and powerful, like an animal being reborn. It is unbelievably sexy. After this I think we'll go straight back to our hotel room and The faintest suggestion of pressure on my palm. I go stiff in the water and pull my hand out from the waves. Ah, shit, I think, toes tingling, there's an animal out here. Oh, fuck. It better not be a fucking shark I swear to God My other hand, still warm and cocooned in the water, is abruptly pulled a few inches forward. I let out a strangled cry and lash out with my feet, but they don't hit anything. David is still underwater. He can't hear me. He can't see me. \"Oh my God.\" Kicking like I am I'm able to stay above the waves, but something has my arm. It's the strangest feeling, moist and rough all at once. Whatever it is the water is too murky to see. To my right, David emerges. \"David!\" I shout, and my voice is thin and reedy. \"You got ta help !\" Another tug on my arm. This time I can't fight it. I go under. For a moment my eyes sting and smart as they adjust to the gloom. Air bubbles stream from my nostrils. I squint and peer out through a fringe of dark eyelashes. It stares back at me. Oh God, oh God. The eyes. The eyes. Huge, massive, luminous discs that rise from the darkness below. Bigger than dinner plates, bigger than my goddamned head. Fixed on me with a dull sparkling intelligence behind them. Its head is so massive that I could lie across the forehead and have room to stretch my legs. Below it is a mammoth fleshy trunk of a neck and a vague approximation of a torso that stretches away into the darkness below. I don't even remember floating so far out. I can just about make out the rounded slope of a shoulder. Oh God, the arms must be meters in length, maybe longer. Oh God. Mermaid, I think. It smiles at me placidly, and in that smile are rows upon rows of jagged, pointed teeth. In between one set I can see a human arm waving sadly, fingers splayed and falling apart in the water, skin hanging loosely and floating with the current. Beyond the teeth is only darkness and a cavernous mouth so vast that I wouldn't be able to touch either cheek with both of my arms extended. The tongues come coiling from between bloodless lips, so many tongues, as thin and whip-like and delicate as the tongues of humans, scenting the air, stirring the water. One is wrapped around my wrist. As I watch, almost fascinated, it runs itself along one of the grease trails on my skin. It shudders, worm-like, and pulls a little tighter. I begin to descend. I'm thrashing now, screaming uselessly, and the air pours from my desperate lungs. Where's David where the fuck is he oh God oh Christ oh no The smile yawns and opens and all I can see is teeth, teeth everywhere, teeth as big as I am.

{"original_text": "The first months were the most shocking ones, afterwards everything calmed down, albeit slowly. The \"aliens\" as we called them at first were very clearly related to us biologically. At least some of them. Some others were completely different, but we didn't meet many of those for obvious reasons. The first step to building a good relationship was learning and teaching our respective languages, albeit they were quite familiar with our earthly tongues. So our groups were mostly taught Amambwe, Lysano, and Thindlurrinni, three of the most common languages of the newcomers. \"Whatever is the reason they are visiting us?\" Anne asked me. \"We don't know yet,\" I replied. Although I had pondered that for quite too long, I couldn't really come to a conclusion. They weren't threatening, they weren't exchanging information -other than linguistic ones, that is. Their coming was unknown to us, but welcome they were. Not that we didn't have groups of nut-jobs walking around the streets demonstrating. But if they had met the \"aliens\" face to face, they'd feel otherwise. These ones were almost exactly like humans, but they radiated an otherworldiness that can't be put down to words. Was it their scrutinising gaze? The fact that they smiled too much? The fact that they could speak our languages almost perfectly? \"Is everything going alright?\" Ansemi asked me. \"Oh, you startled me!\" I replied. \"Yeah, everything's fine.\" The way these..... people? Sure. The way these people could creep up on you was uncanny. They almost made no sound whatsoever. \"I didn't mean to\" he said in Lyseno. \"It is okay,\" I replied in my broken speech which he didn't mock. \"Lilly,\" he said, \"I wanted to ask you something. \"Only if you let me ask you something in return\" I said. \"You know I'm not allowed. Not yet.\" \"Yeah, I know\" I sighed. \"Sure, ask me.\" I could feel Anne's gaze from across the room. \"Would you like to asswinnento with me?\" \"To what?\" I didn't know that word. \"To go out with me. To have a date.\" I pondered for a second. \"I don't think it would be...\" \"Before you refuse, I have an offer to make. If you come, I'll answer as many questions as I can. It's not much, I know. But it will definitely be more than you already know now.\" His smile was disarming. Three hours later, we were sitting in a small restaurant near my university, with small round tables and cozy colours. Whether the music playing was lounge or some kind of jazz, I couldn't tell. Ansemi was handsome as ever, and his attire was impeccable, if only a bit overdressed. Or was I the one who thought this would be more casual. \"So, Lilly,\" he said and drank a sip of wine, \"I guess you have many questions, but so do I. I hope you don't mind.\" \"Not at all,\" I said, as long as you provide me with enough info. \"Shall I go first?\" I said. He nodded. \"Are humans and your people related?\" \"Yes, indeed. We are very closely related.\" \"Is panspermia correct?\" \"That I do not know, but it might as well be. Now it's my turn. Do you like me?\" \"Oh, blunt. Alright, I can play that game.\" I smiled. \"Well \"Are you ready to order?\" asked the young waitress. \"Beef tartare, smoked cheddar, chestnut,\" Ansemi said. I was about to order a cheeseburger, but with that I changed my mind. \"I'll have the same, thanks.\" \"So,\" sighs Ansemi with a big bright smile. \"Yes. Indeed, I can't deny that you're a good-looking fella,\" I reply, without actually answering his question. But it seems it's enough for him. \"Did you come to destroy us or take us out for expensive dinners?\" I asked. He laughed. \"We didn't come to destroy you, no. We have come to build an alliance between our people and yours. And of course, we'll help you technologically.\" \"But you'll want something in return.\" \"Naturally,\" he said, \"but whether or not you do help us, we'll still help you and our alliance won't change nonetheless.\" \"May I ask what it is that you're after?\" \"This is confidential.\" \"I shall never speak of it.\" \"Our people can not reproduce. We shall ask your people's representatives for reproductive cells. We know you already donate male cells, so I don't think it would be that much of a deal.\" \"I don't think so either,\" I frown, \"but then how did you come into being?\" \"My turn to make a question,\" he smiled. \"Have you ever been married?\" \"Yes. Once. It didn't last. He was a bastard.\" You looked at me quizzically. \"I kid! I mean, I was married, yes. But he wasn't a bastard. It just didn't work out. We were too young and too carrier-driven to even notice that our marriage was falling apart. Until, we did. So we ended it.\" He nodded. His questions were always intimate. Mine were never that. So I changed my tactic. \"Do you have a family back there, on your planet?\" \"No, not really. I have a clan though,\" he said. \"A clan of brothers and sisters. Most of them work as farmers now though.\" \"What do they do there, make crop circles? \" I asked, saying the last word in English, for I didn't think there might be an equivalent. \"Excuse me?\" he asked. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" I said, I didn't mean to offend.\" \"No, I mean. I don't know that word.\" Curious, I wondered. The derivation was obvious, crop circle. His English was exceptional. So, I try to improvise. \"You know, like vistammyne,\" I said, quite literally,'round thing'. \"Vistammyne on field crops.\" For the first time he lost his smile. \"What do you know about those? Where did you get this information?\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked, kinda scared. The waitress comes with our dishes. No one thanked her, despite her politeness. \"I'm not sure what you're asking,\" I said. \"I just made a joke, but I'm sorry if I offended you.\" \"How do you know about vistammyne? Who told you?\" \"No one told me! Crop circles have been a pop culture thing in like forever!\" I reply in English, so that I could make sure none of my words would be interpreted any differently from what I'd intended. \"Are you serious?\" he asked. I take out my iPhone, google \"crop circles\" and show him the picture results. \"I I have to go!\" he replied and left me there. The alien just had a case of Runaway Bride.

But if they had met the \"aliens\" face to face, they'd feel otherwise. These ones were almost exactly like humans, but they radiated an otherworldiness that can't be put down to words. Was it their scrutinising gaze? The fact that they smiled too much? The fact that they could speak our languages almost perfectly? \"Is everything going alright?\" Ansemi asked me. \"Oh, you startled me!\" I replied. \"Yeah, everything's fine.\" The way these..... people? Sure. The way these people could creep up on you was uncanny. They almost made no sound whatsoever. \"I didn't mean to\" he said in Lyseno. \"It is okay,\" I replied in my broken speech which he didn't mock. \"Lilly,\" he said, \"I wanted to ask you something. \"Only if you let me ask you something in return\" I said. \"You know I'm not allowed. Not yet.\" \"Yeah, I know\" I sighed. \"Sure, ask me.\" I could feel Anne's gaze from across the room. \"Would you like to asswinnento with me?\" \"To what?\" I didn't know that word. \"To go out with me. To have a date.\" I pondered for a second. \"I don't think it would be...\" \"Before you refuse, I have an offer to make. If you come, I'll answer as many questions as I can. It's not much, I know. But it will definitely be more than you already know now.\" His smile was disarming. Three hours later, we were sitting in a small restaurant near my university, with small round tables and cozy colours. Whether the music playing was lounge or some kind of jazz, I couldn't tell. Ansemi was handsome as ever, and his attire was impeccable, if only a bit overdressed. Or was I the one who thought this would be more casual. \"So, Lilly,\" he said and drank a sip of wine, \"I guess you have many questions, but so do I. I hope you don't mind.\" \"Not at all,\" I said, as long as you provide me with enough info. \"Shall I go first?\" I said. He nodded. \"Are humans and your people related?\" \"Yes, indeed. We are very closely related.\" \"Is panspermia correct?\" \"That I do not know, but it might as well be. Now it's my turn. Do you like me?\" \"Oh, blunt. Alright, I can play that game.\" I smiled. \"Well \"Are you ready to order?\" asked the young waitress. \"Beef tartare, smoked cheddar, chestnut,\" Ansemi said. I was about to order a cheeseburger, but with that I changed my mind. \"I'll have the same, thanks.\" \"So,\" sighs Ansemi with a big bright smile. \"Yes. Indeed, I can't deny that you're a good-looking fella,\" I reply, without actually answering his question. But it seems it's enough for him. \"Did you come to destroy us or take us out for expensive dinners?\" I asked. He laughed. \"We didn't come to destroy you, no. We have come to build an alliance between our people and yours. And of course, we'll help you technologically.\" \"But you'll want something in return.\" \"Naturally,\" he said, \"but whether or not you do help us, we'll still help you and our alliance won't change nonetheless.\" \"May I ask what it is that you're after?\" \"This is confidential.\" \"I shall never speak of it.\" \"Our people can not reproduce. We shall ask your people's representatives for reproductive cells. We know you already donate male cells, so I don't think it would be that much of a deal.\" \"I don't think so either,\" I frown, \"but then how did you come into being?\" \"My turn to make a question,\" he smiled. \"Have you ever been married?\" \"Yes. Once. It didn't last. He was a bastard.\" You looked at me quizzically. \"I kid! I mean, I was married, yes. But he wasn't a bastard. It just didn't work out. We were too young and too carrier-driven to even notice that our marriage was falling apart. Until, we did. So we ended it.\" He nodded. His questions were always intimate. Mine were never that. So I changed my tactic. \"Do you have a family back there, on your planet?\" \"No, not really. I have a clan though,\" he said. \"A clan of brothers and sisters. Most of them work as farmers now though.\" \"What do they do there, make crop circles? \" I asked, saying the last word in English, for I didn't think there might be an equivalent. \"Excuse me?\" he asked. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" I said, I didn't mean to offend.\" \"No, I mean. I don't know that word.\" Curious, I wondered. The derivation was obvious, crop circle. His English was exceptional. So, I try to improvise. \"You know, like vistammyne,\" I said, quite literally,'round thing'. \"Vistammyne on field crops.\" For the first time he lost his smile. \"What do you know about those? Where did you get this information?\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked, kinda scared. The waitress comes with our dishes. No one thanked her, despite her politeness. \"I'm not sure what you're asking,\" I said. \"I just made a joke, but I'm sorry if I offended you.\" \"How do you know about vistammyne? Who told you?\" \"No one told me! Crop circles have been a pop culture thing in like forever!\" I reply in English, so that I could make sure none of my words would be interpreted any differently from what I'd intended. \"Are you serious?\" he asked. I take out my iPhone, google \"crop circles\" and show him the picture results. \"I I have to go!\" he replied and left me there. The alien just had a case of Runaway Bride. At least the beef was good."}

How could I possibly entertain you with a story?\" \"Nonsense!\" the All Mighty One replied. \"Anyone can tell a good story, and I have a feeling you have one up your sleeve.\" So, I cleared my throat and began: Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in a valley surrounded by mountains, there lived a poor farmer named Jack. Jack had worked hard all his life and struggled to make ends meet. One day, while working in his field, he stumbled upon a strange seed. He wasn't sure what it was but decided to plant it. Days turned into weeks, and Jack's crop began to grow. It grew taller and taller until one day, a beanstalk had grown up so high it disappeared into the clouds. Jack climbed the beanstalk and found himself in a magical land where he met a giant who owned a castle. The giant had valuable treasures and treasures that Jack had never seen before. Jack began to plot how he could get his hands on the treasures without being caught by the giant. He learned that the giant's weak spot was his hearing. So, Jack stole as much treasure as he could and sneaked away while the giant was asleep. After several trips, the giant finally caught Jack red-handed. Jack quickly tried to run away, but the giant pursued him relentlessly. Just when the giant caught up to Jack, he tripped and fell down the beanstalk, crashing to his death. Jack had learned a valuable lesson about greed and never wanted to risk his life or the lives of others again. He used his newfound wealth to help his family and his community prosper.

{"original_text": "People often write about how they woke up in a new world. A world with its own rules, new to you and yet so painfully normal to everyone else within that existence. This isn't like that, though. When I woke up, nothing was different for me. World wide, nothing seemed different for anyone. No one realized overnight, or even within the first week. It took weeks, months even, for people to realize and come to terms with what happened. I was young when it happened. Fifteen, hardly at my prime, and there was so much adjustment. Men had been the dominant force in the world, mostly due to the fact that they were stronger and faster. A trait that really only mattered in a more medieval setting, mind you, but old habits died hard. Throughout bouts for equality and calls for reform, women never truly caught up. Thing was, though, that people had a funny way of adjusting to what was new. Our entire lives are spent getting over stuff. War, death, crime and poverty. Movies and TV shows that depict the end of days, and people stop wincing when a couple thousand are cropped off a population of billions. For some reason, people expected this to be any different. It was strange, yes, that men were suddenly the weaker species. Women didn't get any stronger, however. Men universally got weaker. Shred from their physical prowess without so much as a warning, the world took some time to adjust. It wasn't merely about stepping back and allowing women to take the lead. Everything, daily and trivial things no one had thought about before, had to be rethought. Road work, construction, menial labor, mines, war, all of which men had no real superiority in other than their natural given power. And yet, when they were less than a quarter the strength (on average) as women, women couldn't merely pick up the slack. They tried, but these were tasks designed for a strength that just wasn't naturally met. Women, though, were smart. The world changed faster than it ever did with men on top. With all the jokes about how we'd never get anything done once a month, the progress never seemed to slow down. A lot of people expected payback. For men to be treated as lesser, given the \"housewife\" treatment as most reality hosts called it. That was never the case from what I saw. Men were treated the same, if not with a little pity thrown in. Still respected, still thought of as equals by a vast majority of the female race. There were always exceptions, but that was with any rule. Men just had to get use to a world where their strength was a hindrance. I did not. I never felt the transition, though it wasn't just because of my age. In school, I would lift things for our teacher that even she thought was too heavy. At home, Mother and Father had to adjust to my being able to move things about the house at a whim. Of course Mother could do it, but not with the ease that I was able to demonstrate. As I grew older, my strength only increased. As the years passed, and I was an extremely active young man, my natural abilities were increasing exponentially. I worked out every single day I could, while attempting not to demonstrate too much of my strength in school. No one knew, not even my best friends, how strong I truly was. No one could tell just by looking at me either. Men were weaker, but their bodies were still capable of appearing toned and muscular. No, I looked no different than the rest of the men, and yet I was so very different. The history books say that the average man was two and a half times as strong as the average woman. I'd estimate I was stronger, faster, more agile than most men from that time now. My parents saw it as a freak accident, something my future family would one day find impressive. People in the past could notice obvious superiority in those with the utmost fitness. UFC fighters, special forces, all of which were strong in a time where anyone could achieve it. As far as I know, I'm the last human being in the world who is capable of this sort of strength before evolution catches back up.

{"original_text": "He drifted slowly to sleep, sinking into his soft covers and feeling the darkness envelope him. As usual, a thick fog began creeping into his mind until, slowly, the beginnings of a landscape could be seen through the endless gray. A long and empty road, a lone flickering streetlight; the moon hung full in a clear sky. Like every night for almost as far back as he cared to remember, he visited this road. It didn't lead to anywhere. He could walk for hours and nothing would change. The first time he stumbled upon this weary and dark landscape still stuck in his memory. It was countless years ago, but it wasn't on purpose. He was a much younger and happier man. That night, the air was thicker. A low growl permeated the world around him. The light flickered a few more times before it lost power, plunging the road into darkness. The growl, now more of a roar, seemed to fill his mind until he no longer knew where it was coming from. He started to panic. Could it be? Was it possible that the creature of the nightmares of his youth had returned? Then the whispers began, and cold air drifted down his spine. Terrified, he jolted himself awake, and jumped out of bed. It would be a while before he purposely visited the land of dreams. Immortality is a strange thing.

As usual, a thick fog began creeping into his mind until, slowly, the beginnings of a landscape could be seen through the endless gray. A long and empty road, a lone flickering streetlight; the moon hung full in a clear sky. Like every night for almost as far back as he cared to remember, he visited this road. It didn't lead to anywhere. He could walk for hours and nothing would change. The first time he stumbled upon this weary and dark landscape still stuck in his memory. It was countless years ago, but it wasn't on purpose. He was a much younger and happier man. That night, the air was thicker. A low growl permeated the world around him. The light flickered a few more times before it lost power, plunging the road into darkness. The growl, now more of a roar, seemed to fill his mind until he no longer knew where it was coming from. He started to panic. Could it be? Was it possible that the creature of the nightmares of his youth had returned? Then the whispers began, and cold air drifted down his spine. Terrified, he jolted himself awake, and jumped out of bed. It would be a while before he purposely visited the land of dreams. Immortality is a strange thing. It begins as the most amazing thing you can think of. Unlimited time seems like a blessing, until everything succumbs to the passage of time except you. With no end in sight, any immortal man would eventually dream of an undisrupted rest. Luckily for this man, he had that chance. The road in his dream fell into blackness as the streetlight went out.

{"original_text": "It was a normal day, save for a steady down pour of rain in the hot month of July. I didn't really think anything of it other than a cool summer storm and a nice cup of hot chocolate on my porch. My husband had come home from work early due to him having a killer headache. My mom said it was probably the sudden change in weather; she also had some conspiracy theory about it being the government. My mom is a very interesting person. \"Michelle, do you want more hot chocolate?\" Tyler asked, motioning to the almost emptied cup resting upon my pregnant belly. I was almost 35 weeks, and I wanted to die. \"No I'm good love. How's your head?\" I replied, reaching over to rub the top of his thigh. I listened as the ocean waves lapped against the rocky shore beneath our porch. This was my paradise. If I were lucky, I'd see a whale or dolphin pop up here and there. Today, not so much. Just before Tyler could answer, a bright light flashed up in the sky. \"What the fuck was that? My mom asked from the kitchen window. \"It was lightning mom!\" I yelled back. \"Michelle, that's not lightning. There would be thunder...\" Tyler murmured to me. Out of nowhere, a loud boom sounded. I smiled, getting ready to stick my tongue out. \"I told you, Ty. Light but he was right. A giant octagonal shaped thing came hurling down in the distance. It landed in the ocean and made a significant enough splash, I could see it over the horizon past the tall and rough waves. \"Holy shit!\" I jumped, my cup landed hard on the weather treated porch and smashed into smithereens. \"Get inside, now.\" Tyler stated, getting up to help me to my feet. I waddled into the sliding glass door and he shut and locked it behind us. \"Shut the window ma,\" he instructed my mom. \"Why what's going on?\" My mom started to panic, I could see it in her eyes. \"Is it a nuke?!\" She was on level nine freak out. \"No. Mom, it looked like..... it looked like a ship...\" I explained, my words shaking. \"Like a boat or like a pew pew ship?\" She asked as she did finger-guns and twirled her hand above her greying head. \"The second one. I know this will sound crazy but...\" Tyler trailed off, his face conveying shock. \"But what?!\" I asked, lightly beating on his chest. \"Michelle, look outside..\" My head panned from his face to the sliding glass door, and what I saw astounded me. The water was no longer rough and choppy, but was calm. And still. It was like time was paused. \"This will sound crazy but Porter was talking about this. How they, NASA, contacted Dr. David and said they needed help with identifying some sort of foreign specimen they found on that asteroid that crashed in Reno. It had unknown traces and..... DNA from a killer whale. I laughed it off, thought that it might have been a mistake. But I think that it's right. I think they're stealing our sea life. All those dead fish, whales, everything that have washed up lately on the beach.... It's not because of natural causes. I had to keep this under wraps but this.... This proves it. We had no cause as to why they were all dying because they were all healthy. We named it as natural causes to not solicit any fear but.... This puts two and two together.\" Mom and I were speechless. I felt Ava kick in my stomach and I feared for her life. \"Are they gon na come to us?\" I asked after a few seconds. Tyler shook his head. \"They already would have. They have no interest in us. They want the salt and blood from the sea. They want the meat and bones. The ones that washed up had weird bite marks in their abdomens and were missing their spines. I thought it was weird but that's not really my division. It's Porter's.\" Tyler said as he wrapped his arms around me. \"I fucking knew it. I knew aliens were real. I believed every word Uncle Larry was saying to me.\" Mom said, hands on her hips. \"Well what do we.... What do we do?\" I asked, my heart beat fast and my stomach churning. I was hoping it wouldn't effect Ava too much. \"There's not much we can do.

The mechanism of action is the a rapid depletion of body iron, which triggers a voracious appetite for metal-rich foods. The iron is secreted away in multiple areas of the body until approximately 72 hours after initial infection. At that time, the organism begins accreting iron around itself and moves to areas of heat.

{"original_text": "\" Hello Mrs. President. \" \" Hello Mr. - \" Hillary glanced at her calendar \" Smith .\" His appointment was for 2 whole hours. This gentleman must be quite important to occupy so much of her time. \" Have you become accustomed to your new chair yet? \" he asked with a smile \" Well, it's only been a week and I've spent the entire time getting filled in on all sorts of issues, now that my security clearance has been upgraded. \" she said, hoping she did not come across as too complaining. \" I'm afraid this is another one of such meetings. \" Mr. Smith said apologetically. \" Oh, I'm sure it's not too bad. Most of what happens in here is really just the continuations of old problems my husband used to tell me about. \" \" He wouldn't have heard about this issue, as we didn't know about it before 2002. \" he said. \" Also, I should remind you that this subject is on a strictly need-to-know basis, so you might not want to discuss it with your husband. \" Hillary almost chuckled at his little cliche, but something told her that this was serious. The man before her was very well composed and obviously experienced. He did not seem to be impressed with meeting the president for the first time. \" So what is this about? My calender only mentions your name and that you are a scientist of some unspecified sort. \" she said. \" Well, that is true, although I would put more on my business card, if I had one. I am the director of a research institution that was founded in late 2002 to examine an object of alien origin. \" he said. Hillary knew that many scientists mused about the possibility of aliens, but she had never been interested in that discussion. She knew she should probably be excited about the fact that alien life was apparently confirmed, but she had gotten used to the president-routine now and quickly got on with the practical details. \" Okay. Interesting. How expensive is it and what results have you come up with? \" she asked bluntly. \" It is very expensive. Currently we are using about 100 billion dollars annually, and it used to be higher. \" he said. He looked down for a short moment and then continued. \" And as for the results, we are only working on containment, and it is successfully being contained. .\" That was a large number. She should have noticed such an amount of money in the budgets. \" I am pretty familiar with the government finances. How do you manage to get that amount of money? I'm pretty sure I haven't seen'Alien research' on any of the budget proposals. \" she said with a smile. \" We get it through the military spending of the State Department. \" he said. Well the State Department spending did go up 350 billion between 2002 and 2010 but.... \" But how did you get it while the war in Iraq was going on? \" she inquired. \" The war wasn't as expensive as reported. So we just got the extra overhead. \" he replied. Hillery hoped this wasn't the only reason they had gone to Iraq. \" Okay. You said you were working on containment only? What kind of object is this? \" \" Yes, \" he said \" The object is a perfect cube about 1 meter across. We discovered it in the middle of a meteor crater surrounded by a 5 meter thick spherical shield. The inner part of the shield was made of gold and the outer part was made of a very heat resistant and durable alloy. \" Hillary didn't care much for the technical aspects, but it seemed well rehearsed, so she didn't interrupt. \" But although the shield was very resistant against blunt force impact, it was easy enough to cut open. So in 2004, we did. We accounted for everything, and prepared for the worst. Even if the cube had been made out of antimatter, the bunker would have contained the explosion. At first, after we opened the sphere, it was rather anticlimactic. Just a black cube, covered in a slimy substance. After a few minutes our initial analysis showed that the substance contained an acid, perfect for dissolving the explosion-proof container we had made. We quickly encapsulated it in a plastic container, that the acid should have been inert to, but after a few minutes the substance changed properties and started dissolving the plastic. \" he explained. Mr. Smith shrugged his shoulders and continued. \" We ended up placing it inside the original gold container again. \" That did sound anticlimactic. \" So I guess that accounts for the expenses up to 2004. What did you do afterwards? \" Hillary asked. \" Well, after we had closed up the gold shell, we detected an extremely small vibration from inside. It turns out, that the substance contained micro machinery which was drilling through the gold. This seemed strange since it could have done that before we brought it in. However, it became clear that this object was harvesting energy from the environment and using this to break down the gold. We discovered it because it drilled far less in the gold after we turned off the lights when replacing the shield. \" Mr Smith explained. \" Soon after it completely stopped drilling. We hoped that it meant that it had run out of energy, which could perhaps allow us to do more experiments on it. But after a few months of being in the same container, it suddenly started making its microscopic holes in the gold like it was drilling through butter. We just barely avoided a containment breach, and afterwards we found out, that it had probably harvested energy from combination of two things. A small thermal gradient, and vibration energy from a motor running nearby. \" \" A thermal gradient? \" Hillary asked with one eyebrow raised. Now she had let him talk uninterrupted for long enough. Scientists often seemed to have a habit of sliding into an overly technical jargon when they had been talking for too long. \" Sorry, it's when there are two different temperatures on each side of an object. It can be used to generate energy, but it's usually in so tiny amounts that - \" \" Okay ,\" Hillary interrupted before he could get going again. \" So it seems like it wants to escape, and you are trying to contain it, although it's proving to be difficult. \" \" Yes, but the fact that it suddenly started storing its energy instead of constantly drilling, implies that it understands, that it is being contained and it is getting smarter about escaping. This caused us to ramp up the security. There now are quite a lot of layers of different protection mechanisms in place. \" Mr. Smith clarified. Hillary could see the difficulties, but it did not seem to make sense. Why was it trying to escape? \" Have you tried communicating with it? \" She asked. \" Well, we have tried. We drill small holes in the gold shield to interact with the object and send in signals. Mostly low power, low frequency communication, as we don't want to give it energy. So far the only response we have gotten is dissolving equipment. \" he said while shrugging his shoulders again. \" We don't know what it's for or why it's here on earth. We do have some ideas, and they seem to universally conclude that keeping the object isolated from its surroundings is the best course of action. \" \" Can you elaborate on the ideas? How can you possibly conclude anything from an object that doesn't communicate? \" Hillary asked sceptically. \" Well, we know it was sent to earth in a shell that isolated the object. So someone, somewhere thought that sending it without a prison was a bad idea. The question is, why not just throw it into the sun, if they didn't want it to be free?

Earth is well enough off not to flip that coin. \" Thank you for the briefing, please continue your work. \" she said. Mr. Smith bowed politely and left the room.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "\" Hello Mrs. President. \" \" Hello Mr. - \" Hillary glanced at her calendar \" Smith .\" His appointment was for 2 whole hours. This gentleman must be quite important to occupy so much of her time. \" Have you become accustomed to your new chair yet? \" he asked with a smile \" Well, it's only been a week and I've spent the entire time getting filled in on all sorts of issues, now that my security clearance has been upgraded. \" she said, hoping she did not come across as too complaining. \" I'm afraid this is another one of such meetings. \" Mr. Smith said apologetically. \" Oh, I'm sure it's not too bad. Most of what happens in here is really just the continuations of old problems my husband used to tell me about. \" \" He wouldn't have heard about this issue, as we didn't know about it before 2002. \" he said. \" Also, I should remind you that this subject is on a strictly need-to-know basis, so you might not want to discuss it with your husband. \" Hillary almost chuckled at his little cliche, but something told her that this was serious. The man before her was very well composed and obviously experienced. He did not seem to be impressed with meeting the president for the first time. \" So what is this about? My calender only mentions your name and that you are a scientist of some unspecified sort. \" she said. \" Well, that is true, although I would put more on my business card, if I had one. I am the director of a research institution that was founded in late 2002 to examine an object of alien origin. \" he said. Hillary knew that many scientists mused about the possibility of aliens, but she had never been interested in that discussion. She knew she should probably be excited about the fact that alien life was apparently confirmed, but she had gotten used to the president-routine now and quickly got on with the practical details. \" Okay. Interesting. How expensive is it and what results have you come up with? \" she asked bluntly. \" It is very expensive. Currently we are using about 100 billion dollars annually, and it used to be higher. \" he said. He looked down for a short moment and then continued. \" And as for the results, we are only working on containment, and it is successfully being contained. .\" That was a large number. She should have noticed such an amount of money in the budgets. \" I am pretty familiar with the government finances. How do you manage to get that amount of money? I'm pretty sure I haven't seen'Alien research' on any of the budget proposals. \" she said with a smile. \" We get it through the military spending of the State Department. \" he said. Well the State Department spending did go up 350 billion between 2002 and 2010 but.... \" But how did you get it while the war in Iraq was going on? \" she inquired. \" The war wasn't as expensive as reported. So we just got the extra overhead. \" he replied. Hillery hoped this wasn't the only reason they had gone to Iraq. \" Okay. You said you were working on containment only? What kind of object is this? \" \" Yes, \" he said \" The object is a perfect cube about 1 meter across. We discovered it in the middle of a meteor crater surrounded by a 5 meter thick spherical shield. The inner part of the shield was made of gold and the outer part was made of a very heat resistant and durable alloy. \" Hillary didn't care much for the technical aspects, but it seemed well rehearsed, so she didn't interrupt. \" But although the shield was very resistant against blunt force impact, it was easy enough to cut open. So in 2004, we did. We accounted for everything, and prepared for the worst. Even if the cube had been made out of antimatter, the bunker would have contained the explosion. At first, after we opened the sphere, it was rather anticlimactic. Just a black cube, covered in a slimy substance. After a few minutes our initial analysis showed that the substance contained an acid, perfect for dissolving the explosion-proof container we had made. We quickly encapsulated it in a plastic container, that the acid should have been inert to, but after a few minutes the substance changed properties and started dissolving the plastic. \" he explained. Mr. Smith shrugged his shoulders and continued. \" We ended up placing it inside the original gold container again. \" That did sound anticlimactic. \" So I guess that accounts for the expenses up to 2004. What did you do afterwards? \" Hillary asked. \" Well, after we had closed up the gold shell, we detected an extremely small vibration from inside. It turns out, that the substance contained micro machinery which was drilling through the gold. This seemed strange since it could have done that before we brought it in. However, it became clear that this object was harvesting energy from the environment and using this to break down the gold. We discovered it because it drilled far less in the gold after we turned off the lights when replacing the shield. \" Mr Smith explained. \" Soon after it completely stopped drilling. We hoped that it meant that it had run out of energy, which could perhaps allow us to do more experiments on it. But after a few months of being in the same container, it suddenly started making its microscopic holes in the gold like it was drilling through butter. We just barely avoided a containment breach, and afterwards we found out, that it had probably harvested energy from combination of two things. A small thermal gradient, and vibration energy from a motor running nearby. \" \" A thermal gradient? \" Hillary asked with one eyebrow raised. Now she had let him talk uninterrupted for long enough. Scientists often seemed to have a habit of sliding into an overly technical jargon when they had been talking for too long. \" Sorry, it's when there are two different temperatures on each side of an object. It can be used to generate energy, but it's usually in so tiny amounts that - \" \" Okay ,\" Hillary interrupted before he could get going again. \" So it seems like it wants to escape, and you are trying to contain it, although it's proving to be difficult. \" \" Yes, but the fact that it suddenly started storing its energy instead of constantly drilling, implies that it understands, that it is being contained and it is getting smarter about escaping. This caused us to ramp up the security. There now are quite a lot of layers of different protection mechanisms in place. \" Mr. Smith clarified. Hillary could see the difficulties, but it did not seem to make sense. Why was it trying to escape? \" Have you tried communicating with it? \" She asked. \" Well, we have tried. We drill small holes in the gold shield to interact with the object and send in signals. Mostly low power, low frequency communication, as we don't want to give it energy. So far the only response we have gotten is dissolving equipment. \" he said while shrugging his shoulders again. \" We don't know what it's for or why it's here on earth. We do have some ideas, and they seem to universally conclude that keeping the object isolated from its surroundings is the best course of action. \" \" Can you elaborate on the ideas? How can you possibly conclude anything from an object that doesn't communicate? \" Hillary asked sceptically. \" Well, we know it was sent to earth in a shell that isolated the object. So someone, somewhere thought that sending it without a prison was a bad idea. The question is, why not just throw it into the sun, if they didn't want it to be free? Were they afraid that it would harvest all the energy instead of breaking? But then why not send it out of the galaxy? \" Mr. Smith mused. \" Maybe it is intelligent and destructive.

The hedges were overgrown, and the paths were barely visible now. Still, it was clear how magnificent the maze had been, once upon a time. The old knight's face seemed remorseful, his eyes distant, as if remembering those times. In the pond two koi fish danced around each other. One of them was gold, and the other black. The water would flicker with their colours as the sun glinted off their scales, and every time it did so a little rumble would send the water on the surface trembling, and sparks would fly out from the middle of the two fish. From down the path to the knight's left a rabbit emerged from underneath the hedgerow. Cautiously, sniffing the air, it determined that the maze was deserted and came out further. It was very fluffy and grey. The old knight stayed still, and the rabbit did not notice him. The rabbit foraged silently, its head buried in the grass. The way to the old knight's position was a singular path, paralleled on both sides by rose bushes. The roses grew in all different colours, on the same bush, from indigo to yellow and all the spectrum in between. Upon closer inspection, one would find that the petals were made of glass. It was said that in the middle of the maze was a fountain, or a tree. No one could decide which, as it was arguably both. The water spread upwards from the base, twisting and bubbling, until it rained down again in drips like a heavy rain, or the branches of a willow tree. No one knew what drinking from the fountain would do, not even the knight. No one had found the fountaintree for a long time. And eventually, people had stopped trying to find it. They were more likely to find the bodies of previous attempters, skeletons petrified in their final crawl, perhaps a finger stretched out, trying to point the way. Their skeletons rusted in the dew. And now the garden was overgrown, and it's secrets were unknown to all but the knight, and soon to be hidden forever. A hawk cast a shadow across the shoulders of the old knight, before diving to snatch the rabbit. The rabbit, all of a sudden surprised by the bird's dive, exploded into the white seeds of a dandelion, which were then scattered into the wind by the hawk's talons. The old knight stayed motionless, hands upon the pommel of his greatsword, his chin resting upon them. The hawk rose from its swoop, confused, and distracted, and so did not see the spiderweb stretched between the hedges. It's beak pierced the very middle, and the threads closed around her like a tattered cloak. She thrashed weakly as dozens of spiders revealed themselves amongst the leaves, shaking their spears and cheering. Music could be heard, simple tones that echoed over the maze, drifting closer and receding. The knight waited, and the music revealed itself as a dragonfly flew around one corner. It flew so fast, and turned at right angles, and each time it did so a tone rang out. A long time ago, a musical troop had tried to navigate the maze by mapping the tones to certain corners, as they had discovered a pattern. Nevertheless, they failed. The maze had other tricks, almost as many as it had stories. There were butterflies that set your clothes on fire if they landed on you. There were some passages that never ended.

I run through here every day.\" \"Jack, you're the villain of this piece.\" Jack looked at the woman who was already looking back at him, \"Did you hear that?\" There was a loud drumming that sounded like thunder in the distance when god spoke down to them again, \"Jack, slit her throat.\" \"Why would I do that?\" Jack asked the booming voice from above.

It wasn't exactly something simple to comprehend, especially for older people who had lived in a world filled with death. But for me it had become a fact of life, and I had never looked back. Would I rather have balls and a dick, or a young body forever. Well, I guess for me it was an obvious choice.

What could be in those immunizations that only people without those organs could take?\" The TV blared in the background talking about the top plays of the week. \"Did they ever tell you what they did with the organs?\" Suddenly the comfortable atmosphere slipped away, and Emily nervously drank from her bottle. \"What if..... what if they were using them..... ya know, somehow in the immunizations.\" We all stared at Joey as he spoke. \"I mean, I don't know about you guys but I wanted to know what was going to happen to my, well stuff.

{"original_text": "For my first thirty sum odd years of existence I never really gave any thought to the notions of God, the supernatural, or even extraterrestrial life. I was the kind of person who had to see something happen right before my eyes to believe that it actually happened. I grew up in a small Alaskan town near the coast that you've probably never heard of. The town was relatively close to a nearby oil rig and it wasn't uncommon to see drifters come and go looking for employment on the rig or one of the many fishing and crabbing vessels. The people in my town were as rough as the strenuous life they lived. Like I said, it wasn't uncommon to meet people from all over the world searching for work. I became friends with many of them and even enemies with a few. However, one drifter in particular left such an impression that he changed the very fundamentals of everything I thought I knew. Larry arrived in our town in late February that year. Earlier that year there was an explosion on the oil rig that was caused by some natural gas or something, I don't really understand how all of that stuff works, and the whole thing was pretty much destroyed but miraculously the crew had survived. I ran a little bar in the town, not much to look at, but it was the only watering hole for 50 miles in every direction. One morning as I was sweeping outside the bar, cleaning up from the night before, a face approached me that I had never seen before which like I said isn't at all uncommon in my town. \"Can I help you?\" I said, \"Sorry to bother you this early, but I'm new in town and recently unemployed.\" He said. \"I was just wondering if maybe you're hiring, I'm not too proud for any job that you could give me.\" I actually wasn't hiring at the moment and to be honest I couldn't really afford to hire anyone else, but I really felt sorry for the guy. \"I guess he can help out bussing tables and bar hopping.\" I thought. The military had also recently moved into the area doing some kind of weather research about 20 miles north, and the soldiers had begun to flock to my place. I figured maybe I could use the extra help. He was a pretty big guy as well, about 6'4 and looked strong as an ox. Every now and then a drifter would come in who thought he was a hard ass so having this guy around to settle a few scores wouldn't hurt either. \"We'll I could use someone to help out around here as a matter of fact.\" \"I can't pay you very much, but I do have an extra room above the bar that you can stay in if you'd like.\" I said. \"That'd be great.\" He said. \"When can I start?\" \"Well first I need to know your name.\" I said. \"Larry\" he said. \"Nice to meet you.\" Larry was a better worker than I had ever imagined. He was hard-working, polite, and the guy never seemed to get tired. All of the regulars loved him and we became pretty good friends too. I decided to take Larry with me to a mechanic that I knew in a town about thirty miles east. My truck's transmission light had been on for a while and I decided to have it looked at. The night before there had been some really heavy snowfall and the roads were in terrible condition. We came around a curve in the road and saw that someone had missed the curve and ran their truck off the road about 50 yards into a healthy pine tree. The truck was completely wrapped around the tree and the tree had fallen on top of the truck as well. We pulled over and ran to the truck as quickly as we could. In the passenger seat we saw and older man slumped to the side and bleeding pretty badly, but he was breathing. The way the truck was wrapped around the base of the tree and the way that the rest of it was on top of the truck there was no way to get the man out. The man was seriously injured and losing blood fast. \"Go back to the truck and close your eyes.\" Larry said in a tone I had never heard before. \"WHAT?!\" \"Do it.\" \"Now.\" He said. Dumbfounded, I reluctantly walked back to the truck, both angry and confused, and did what he said. Well, not completely. I watched. What I saw, I could not believe. Larry walked over to the truck and like you or I might lift a 20 pound dumbbell, he lifted that massive tree trunk off the top of the truck. I was in disbelief. What he did next was even more remarkable. He then proceeded to unwrap the truck from around the tree WITH HIS HANDS. When Larry walked back over to my truck holding the barely breathing man in his arms he could tell by the look on my face that I had not done as he said. After he laid the man in the backseat of my truck he got in on the passenger side of the truck and and with an inexplicable look of almost shame in his eye said, \"forget what you saw, and never speak of it.\" At that point I knew that Larry was unlike anyone else on this planet. Over the next few months feats like this continued to occur. Each time Larry seemed more and more reluctant to perform them. We never spoke of any of them and I could tell in eyes that he appreciated my silence on the subject. Larry began showing up at work In the mornings having not slept the night before. I knew this because he was never at his apartment above the bar. I watched him from my house across the street take off north every night. On foot. To the north there was absolutely nothing but an old, dilapidated road for the next 20 or so miles. Every morning as I was cleaning up from the night before I would see him come walking down that road towards the bar. I still don't know exactly what he was doing or we he was going but I suspected it had something to do with that military research going on up north. I will never forget the last night I saw Larry. A trucker hauling freshly cut timber stopped in to have a few drinks with his buddies that evening. This guy had come in a few times before and he was a real asshole every time. I had recently hired a new waitress and he decided to make it a priority that night to harass her as much as possible. Both Larry and I, were ready to throw this guy out but she told us not to worry and that she had dealt with pricks before and this guy was no different. The next time she went over there the guy decided to grab her ass and that was it. Larry was steaming and looked over at me and I have him the \"throw his ass on the street\" nod. Larry walked over there and said \"Thats enough.\" \"What are you gunna do about it?\" Said the trucker. \"Well then I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\" The guy then took his glass of beer and threw threw it in Larry's face. Larry never budged but, the guy wasn't through yet. He became angry and shoved Larry as hard as he possibly could. Larry didnt move an inch and in fact the guy bounced back off of Larry. Larry then turned around and began to walk off when suddenly a beer can came hurdling in and hit him in the back of the head. Larry walked towards the door and before he went outside gave me a wink that I will never forget. That was the last time I ever saw Larry. However, when we walked outside something unimaginable had unfolded. The truckers truck was 20 feet in the air, impaled by a string of telephone polls. I can not begin to accurately describe what we saw out there. I do know, however, who was responsible. I walked up the short flight of stairs to Larry's apartment and everything was still there but I knew he wouldn't be back. But before I left I noticed above the doorframe someone had carved, more like burned, two letters. It looked like a set of initials and it read C.K.

I became friends with many of them and even enemies with a few. However, one drifter in particular left such an impression that he changed the very fundamentals of everything I thought I knew. Larry arrived in our town in late February that year. Earlier that year there was an explosion on the oil rig that was caused by some natural gas or something, I don't really understand how all of that stuff works, and the whole thing was pretty much destroyed but miraculously the crew had survived. I ran a little bar in the town, not much to look at, but it was the only watering hole for 50 miles in every direction. One morning as I was sweeping outside the bar, cleaning up from the night before, a face approached me that I had never seen before which like I said isn't at all uncommon in my town. \"Can I help you?\" I said, \"Sorry to bother you this early, but I'm new in town and recently unemployed.\" He said. \"I was just wondering if maybe you're hiring, I'm not too proud for any job that you could give me.\" I actually wasn't hiring at the moment and to be honest I couldn't really afford to hire anyone else, but I really felt sorry for the guy. \"I guess he can help out bussing tables and bar hopping.\" I thought. The military had also recently moved into the area doing some kind of weather research about 20 miles north, and the soldiers had begun to flock to my place. I figured maybe I could use the extra help. He was a pretty big guy as well, about 6'4 and looked strong as an ox. Every now and then a drifter would come in who thought he was a hard ass so having this guy around to settle a few scores wouldn't hurt either. \"We'll I could use someone to help out around here as a matter of fact.\" \"I can't pay you very much, but I do have an extra room above the bar that you can stay in if you'd like.\" I said. \"That'd be great.\" He said. \"When can I start?\" \"Well first I need to know your name.\" I said. \"Larry\" he said. \"Nice to meet you.\" Larry was a better worker than I had ever imagined. He was hard-working, polite, and the guy never seemed to get tired. All of the regulars loved him and we became pretty good friends too. I decided to take Larry with me to a mechanic that I knew in a town about thirty miles east. My truck's transmission light had been on for a while and I decided to have it looked at. The night before there had been some really heavy snowfall and the roads were in terrible condition. We came around a curve in the road and saw that someone had missed the curve and ran their truck off the road about 50 yards into a healthy pine tree. The truck was completely wrapped around the tree and the tree had fallen on top of the truck as well. We pulled over and ran to the truck as quickly as we could. In the passenger seat we saw and older man slumped to the side and bleeding pretty badly, but he was breathing. The way the truck was wrapped around the base of the tree and the way that the rest of it was on top of the truck there was no way to get the man out. The man was seriously injured and losing blood fast. \"Go back to the truck and close your eyes.\" Larry said in a tone I had never heard before. \"WHAT?!\" \"Do it.\" \"Now.\" He said. Dumbfounded, I reluctantly walked back to the truck, both angry and confused, and did what he said. Well, not completely. I watched. What I saw, I could not believe. Larry walked over to the truck and like you or I might lift a 20 pound dumbbell, he lifted that massive tree trunk off the top of the truck. I was in disbelief. What he did next was even more remarkable. He then proceeded to unwrap the truck from around the tree WITH HIS HANDS. When Larry walked back over to my truck holding the barely breathing man in his arms he could tell by the look on my face that I had not done as he said. After he laid the man in the backseat of my truck he got in on the passenger side of the truck and and with an inexplicable look of almost shame in his eye said, \"forget what you saw, and never speak of it.\" At that point I knew that Larry was unlike anyone else on this planet. Over the next few months feats like this continued to occur. Each time Larry seemed more and more reluctant to perform them. We never spoke of any of them and I could tell in eyes that he appreciated my silence on the subject. Larry began showing up at work In the mornings having not slept the night before. I knew this because he was never at his apartment above the bar. I watched him from my house across the street take off north every night. On foot. To the north there was absolutely nothing but an old, dilapidated road for the next 20 or so miles. Every morning as I was cleaning up from the night before I would see him come walking down that road towards the bar. I still don't know exactly what he was doing or we he was going but I suspected it had something to do with that military research going on up north. I will never forget the last night I saw Larry. A trucker hauling freshly cut timber stopped in to have a few drinks with his buddies that evening. This guy had come in a few times before and he was a real asshole every time. I had recently hired a new waitress and he decided to make it a priority that night to harass her as much as possible. Both Larry and I, were ready to throw this guy out but she told us not to worry and that she had dealt with pricks before and this guy was no different. The next time she went over there the guy decided to grab her ass and that was it. Larry was steaming and looked over at me and I have him the \"throw his ass on the street\" nod. Larry walked over there and said \"Thats enough.\" \"What are you gunna do about it?\" Said the trucker. \"Well then I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\" The guy then took his glass of beer and threw threw it in Larry's face. Larry never budged but, the guy wasn't through yet. He became angry and shoved Larry as hard as he possibly could. Larry didnt move an inch and in fact the guy bounced back off of Larry. Larry then turned around and began to walk off when suddenly a beer can came hurdling in and hit him in the back of the head. Larry walked towards the door and before he went outside gave me a wink that I will never forget. That was the last time I ever saw Larry. However, when we walked outside something unimaginable had unfolded. The truckers truck was 20 feet in the air, impaled by a string of telephone polls. I can not begin to accurately describe what we saw out there. I do know, however, who was responsible. I walked up the short flight of stairs to Larry's apartment and everything was still there but I knew he wouldn't be back. But before I left I noticed above the doorframe someone had carved, more like burned, two letters. It looked like a set of initials and it read C.K. Was here."}

{"original_text": "Rough bit of writing, seems like too much work to go through it and rewrite sections so here it is! Josa was like any other, rich tattoos covering his skin. Absently he scratched at one on the back of his hand. It reminded him of lightning - it's forked spikes reaching from wrist towards knuckles. He stopped his observations however as the master passed by and instead kept sweeping. As an orphan and an outcast he had no rights and thought himself lucky that he at least had a few meals a week. It was funny really. Without the outcasts to sweep, mine and toil the citizens would have no crafts or livelihoods with which to placate the high class. And if they were not placated then they would skip the citizens and merely execute a few dozen outcasts. Surely if that continued then a time would come when there were no outcasts to toil, then who would they slaughter? Probably not the citizens, because it wasn't their fault that the Gods had vanished three centuries ago. Oh no, that was the outcasts. Of course. Josa kept his thoughts locked inside his own mind, to question a higher class was to be executed and he had no intention of following in his father's footsteps, or his mother's for that matter. At thirteen or so Josa was too young to work the heavy machinery in the textile mill, but in a few years he would be under the master's whip. Thankfully Josa's fascination with his markings kept his mind from that most of the time. Everyone in Ladenel had markings. Inky black stains that formed patterns and shapes. Josa always thought his were different but it seemed everyone thought the same about their own. Other people's markings were just squiggles to him, but his own had a pattern. The one on his hand was like lightning, his arms contained quick lines like the hurried strokes of a high class painter - seemingly making no concrete shape and yet having a pattern to them all the same. Here and there flame-like shapes licked his skin, perfect, dark circles the size of small fruits dominated other areas and something shaped like the sun sat on his forehead. A pale circle surrounded by lines shining out from it. He had spent countless nights sitting and staring at his marks by moonlight and still had no answers. Some of the high class scholars believed that they predicted the life events of the person. A few radicals thought they were events from a past life and setup whole libraries to catalog and study them hoping to work out who a person was in their previous life. Josa didn't believe either. It wasn't that he thought they were wrong just that he didn't think they were particularly right either. Perhaps the lightning meant he would be struck one day - killed even. The sun on his forehead could be the God under which he was born. The circles? He hadn't decided those yet, nor the lines and flames. Shouts shocked Josa back to the real world. A commotion was brewing outside the mill. Men's voices shouting at each other. Josa glanced around and didn't see the master so he made his way towards the sounds at the far end of the mill, near a wide sliding door. It was shut but it was also very thin. Through he he could hear the voices more clearly. It was a fight of some kind. Not that unusual, but then the faint clinking of chainmail and drawing of swords. Josa slid the doors open a slither and peeked out. What he saw terrified him. Three burly outcasts - marked by their ragged clothing and dirty skin - stood above a motionless guard. His vibrant cloak lying limp on the floor revealing his sparkling chain stained crimson. Two of the men held swords. One looked fine and ornate - the guard's most likely Josa thought - and the other was much more basic and less kept. The shouting had stopped and the three men regarded their equally numbered counterparts eagerly. The guards wore their own rich, red and blue cloaks. Square looking hats adorned their heads and golden buttons accentuated both cloak and hat. Beneath the finery however was a soldier's garb. Chain mail and leather. A large sheath and a smaller knife pouch - after all, the outcasts vastly outnumbered the guard. A flurry of activity began, slashing swords glinting golden sunlight, brilliant cloaks flapping with motion. A few cries, a scream, a thud and a clang of steel. Then the street was silent again. One man remained standing, four dead guards, two dead outcast and a lone, bloody figure standing above them all. Then the man dropped his fine sword and ran. Seconds later Josa heard the shouts and pounding feet of reinforcements drawn to the commotion but the man, the hero, was long gone. What man would dare do such a thing? Josa was part awed and part terrified. He longed to stand up to the high class himself. Not five years ago they had killed his parents by execution for no crime. They were merely outcasts and therefore deserved no life. But despite his brave desires he was too small, too weak and too scared to do what that hero had just done. The approaching guards checked the bodies for life and then began to search the area. One looked Josa's way and caught a glimpse before the boy dashed away. A moment later the doors were wrenched open by two of the guards. Josa ran. But a half starved boy had no chance outrunning well fed and trained soldiers. The mill was big, and had rows of fast moving, spinning machinery, dangerous machinery. The perfect place to hide. Josa sprinted down an aisle between machines. Surprised workers ducked away then cowed as they saw the guard approaching. Josa dashed left, rounding a huge loom and hoping it gave him the seconds he needed to dive under it's whirling mechanisms. He scrambled under spinning wheels and threading needles just as booted feet sprinted past. Josa breathed a sigh of relief and then panted heavily - the overwhelming sound above masking any noise he made. Then the world was yanked away. No, he was yanked away. Pain erupted in his shoulders are gloved hands gripped tightly. He was forced to his feet and held there. He tried to spin to see his attacker but caught only a glimpse of a guard uniform. A dozen paces away a scrawny worker stood, looking guilty. Josa spat at him as the guards dragged him away.

A few radicals thought they were events from a past life and setup whole libraries to catalog and study them hoping to work out who a person was in their previous life. Josa didn't believe either. It wasn't that he thought they were wrong just that he didn't think they were particularly right either. Perhaps the lightning meant he would be struck one day - killed even. The sun on his forehead could be the God under which he was born. The circles? He hadn't decided those yet, nor the lines and flames. Shouts shocked Josa back to the real world. A commotion was brewing outside the mill. Men's voices shouting at each other. Josa glanced around and didn't see the master so he made his way towards the sounds at the far end of the mill, near a wide sliding door. It was shut but it was also very thin. Through he he could hear the voices more clearly. It was a fight of some kind. Not that unusual, but then the faint clinking of chainmail and drawing of swords. Josa slid the doors open a slither and peeked out. What he saw terrified him. Three burly outcasts - marked by their ragged clothing and dirty skin - stood above a motionless guard. His vibrant cloak lying limp on the floor revealing his sparkling chain stained crimson. Two of the men held swords. One looked fine and ornate - the guard's most likely Josa thought - and the other was much more basic and less kept. The shouting had stopped and the three men regarded their equally numbered counterparts eagerly. The guards wore their own rich, red and blue cloaks. Square looking hats adorned their heads and golden buttons accentuated both cloak and hat. Beneath the finery however was a soldier's garb. Chain mail and leather. A large sheath and a smaller knife pouch - after all, the outcasts vastly outnumbered the guard. A flurry of activity began, slashing swords glinting golden sunlight, brilliant cloaks flapping with motion. A few cries, a scream, a thud and a clang of steel. Then the street was silent again. One man remained standing, four dead guards, two dead outcast and a lone, bloody figure standing above them all. Then the man dropped his fine sword and ran. Seconds later Josa heard the shouts and pounding feet of reinforcements drawn to the commotion but the man, the hero, was long gone. What man would dare do such a thing? Josa was part awed and part terrified. He longed to stand up to the high class himself. Not five years ago they had killed his parents by execution for no crime. They were merely outcasts and therefore deserved no life. But despite his brave desires he was too small, too weak and too scared to do what that hero had just done. The approaching guards checked the bodies for life and then began to search the area. One looked Josa's way and caught a glimpse before the boy dashed away. A moment later the doors were wrenched open by two of the guards. Josa ran. But a half starved boy had no chance outrunning well fed and trained soldiers. The mill was big, and had rows of fast moving, spinning machinery, dangerous machinery. The perfect place to hide. Josa sprinted down an aisle between machines. Surprised workers ducked away then cowed as they saw the guard approaching. Josa dashed left, rounding a huge loom and hoping it gave him the seconds he needed to dive under it's whirling mechanisms. He scrambled under spinning wheels and threading needles just as booted feet sprinted past. Josa breathed a sigh of relief and then panted heavily - the overwhelming sound above masking any noise he made. Then the world was yanked away. No, he was yanked away. Pain erupted in his shoulders are gloved hands gripped tightly. He was forced to his feet and held there. He tried to spin to see his attacker but caught only a glimpse of a guard uniform. A dozen paces away a scrawny worker stood, looking guilty. Josa spat at him as the guards dragged him away. Part two:"}
{"original_text": "As I left my house for work I felt as if I had forgotten something. Fed the dogs? Check. Turned off the coffee? Check. Locked the door? Check. I assumed everything was fine and headed about my daily commute. It was a particularly sunny walk to the bus stop. As I reached the little pavilion on the corner and took a seat at the bench, I realized my eyes just couldn't take it anymore and the back of my head was throbbing. So strange, I thought, I haven't felt discomfort like this ever..... I started fumbling in my bag for a pair of sunglasses when a total stranger walked up and sat down next to me. As I pulled out the glasses he spoke calmly, \"Light sensitivity? Does your head hurt? Tension in your neck, maybe?\" Puzzled, I responded, \"Uh, yeah. My head hurts a little bit.\" \"Could be a migraine.\" He pulled out two small capsules and handed them to me, \"Take these.\" \"Thanks?\" I took the pills from him and put them in my pocket. \"That'll be 140.\" He demanded. He had a fierce look in his eyes. I stood up and quickly gave the pills back to him, \"Sorry, no thank you. I'm not paying you for anything.\" \"I said,\" He stepped closer to me, \"That'll be 140...\" I backed up but he kept moving closer. The bus was nowhere in sight. The further back I moved the faster he got and he kept demanding money. I turned and started to jog away slightly, feeling completely creeped out, but he stayed in tow. I ran faster and looked behind me but he was still chasing me. As I started to adjust my focus forward again I tripped. My pants tore at the knee where I fell and there was a deep scrape filled with bits of debris. I looked behind me and the man was closing in. My knee ached. Suddenly another man approached me and offered his hand to help me up. I took his hand and explained, \"Oh thank God, that man back there is chasing me, he's demanding my money!\" The second stranger looked down at my knee and pulled a handkerchief from his pocket. He lightly dabbed at the blood and spoke softly, \"That's quite an abrasion you've got there.\" I was confused, did he not care about the other man that was about to reach us, \"Sir, that man back there...\" \"Now, now, now, it'll be ok. We'll get this cleaned up. It'll be 90.\" He grasped my arm firmly. The first man caught up to us. \"I need that 140!\" the first man shouted. The second man released my arm and turned to the first, \"She's in my care now!\" and with that he shoved him back. The first man took a swing at the second and before I knew it they were trying to kill each other. I started hyperventilating, I was sweating, I didn't understand what was happening. While they fought I backed away slowly and then began to run. I turned down an alleyway and crouched behind a dumpster. The feeling of safety couldn't be attained. I started to shiver and cry all at once. What the hell just happened? \"Are you ok, Honey?\" A woman said in a sweet, reassuring voice. I looked up and a very homey, comforting, motherly lady stood before me. \"NO!\" I wailed, sobbing, \"I was just trying to go to work and these men started hounding me for my money and then they were fighting over who was going to get my money and they chased me and I don't know what's going on and I don't feel safe!\" \"Oh, Sweety...\" she cooed in a soothing voice, \"Deep breaths now. I want you to look around. Think of things you can control. You can control your breathing. You can touch the pavement. You can see the sky. You can smell the air. Not to worry dear, you have a strong hold on your reality.\" I felt a little better, I looked up at her and smiled. She reached out her hand and helped me off the ground, then she looked deep into my eyes and said, \"That'll be 300.\" I screamed bloody murder and ran!

It was clear that we had to do something to help these people, but we had to tread carefully. We couldn't risk altering the course of history or drawing the attention of the king's guards. We spent hours strategizing until a plan emerged.

He knew he couldn't let this little one suffer the same fate as his friend. With the kitten in hand, Bill searched the wreckage for any signs of life. He called out for help but received no response. Determined to survive, he found a safe spot to rest and began to plan his next move. Bill knew he had to find a way to signal for help. He remembered a flare gun he had seen in the equipment room and decided to risk everything to retrieve it. Carefully, he made his way back to the building and searched through the rubble. After what felt like hours, he finally found the flare gun. He loaded the gun and fired a red flare into the sky. Moments later, he heard the sound of a helicopter approaching. Bill held his breath as the rescue team arrived to lift him and the kitten to safety. Bill never forgot the lesson he learned that day about the value of life, no matter how small.

The war had ended when the Sword of the Sun had died defending the Sun King, and with his death, the entire kingdom mourned. But in the midst of the darkness, hope still shone bright. The prince, who had been away fighting in the distant lands, returned victorious with his army and a new hero by his side. He vowed to protect the kingdom and swore to avenge his father's death. As the wedding ceremony proceeded, the prince took his place by the side of his beloved bride. The people of the kingdom sang songs of love and joy, and the newlywed couple danced their first dance under the light of the setting sun. In the days that followed, the prince and his loyal army set out to track down the killer of the Sun King. After months of searching, they finally found the traitor hiding in the hills, surrounded by his treacherous allies. The battle that followed was epic in scale, with the sun shining down on the prince and his army as they fought bravely. In the end, justice was served, and the traitor was defeated. With peace restored to the kingdom, the prince continued to rule with honor and justice, with his queen by his side. The memory of the Sun King was never forgotten, and his legacy lived on through his son, who became a great ruler in his own right.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "As the sun set on the wedding of the Sun King and the Sun Queen, the people of the kingdom fell to their knees in prayer. in the days that followed, the prince and his loyal army set out to track down the killer of theSun King."}

A shriek of frustration and impotence. The anger and sorrow rushed out her body in an audible torrent. She didn't seem to make the sound, it flowed through her, out of her and into the world. Her nails bit into the thick, gnarled bark before breaking, but it did nothing to stop her scratching the mighty tree until her fingers were bleeding splinter filled nubs. She was so close..... she couldn't lose her now. Not when she had come so far. She gathered herself up and hurled herself at the Tree of Life. Her tiny fleshy form battering itself against the gigantic forest monarch. She fell. She rose. She slammed against the wood. She fell again. Blood, sweat and tears mingled on her bruised and broken skin. She threw her broken frame at the roots until she could not rise again. She lay in the dust beneath the immovable giant and wept. Eventually her tears dried but still she lay. She pressed a palm to the root of the tree, trying to speak in whatever language trees do. Giver her back to me..... Finally she rose.

{"original_text": "A soft breeze tenderly provoked the Mage's auburn hair as her gentle eyes surveyed the magnificent glacier known as'Duratus.' The air surrounding the glacier was frigid, and the Mage's rosy cheeks were evidence of the cold. Despite the harsh conditions, the Mage couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder as she gazed upon the icy structure before her. Suddenly, a gust of wind picked up, sending chills down the Mage's spine. She tugged her cloak tighter around her body, grateful for its warmth. As she continued to study the glacier, she noticed movement at the base of Duratus. Curiosity piqued, the Mage began making her way towards the movement. As she got closer, she could make out the figure of a lone traveler. He seemed to be struggling to navigate the treacherous terrain, slipping and sliding on the ice. Without hesitation, the Mage rushed to the traveler's aid. She used her magic to create a path of solid ground for him to walk on, leading him safely to her side. \"Thank you,\" the traveler gasped, shivering from the cold. The Mage smiled kindly at him, offering him her cloak for warmth. Together, they made their way off the glacier, grateful for each other's company and assistance. As they parted ways, the Mage couldn't help but feel proud of herself for being a helpful assistant to someone in need. She knew that even the smallest acts of kindness could make a significant impact in someone's life.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "The Mage's journey to the top of a glacier began with an unexpected twist of fate.

{"original_text": "President-Regent Langley was due to meet with Chinese President Ha Jin today at noon, in the White House Blue Room. Press and other observers from both sides of the Pacific crowded the Rose Garden and the lobby, jockeying for entry. What the President-Regent did today how he conducted himself would determine the course of the current hostilities. The two statesmen danced the usual Kabuki act of formality: handshakes, mutual bows, an invitation to have a seat, smiles for the cameras. Their discussion in the Blue Room was not ever meant to be substantive, but just look good for the PR machine. The real discussions were happening, and would continue to happen, behind closed doors, in embassies and conference rooms, and they would involve not just the two heads of state but whole retinues of career diplomats working tirelessly, around the clock, to avert nuclear war. \"It's an honor to have you here today,\" President-Regent Langley said to President Ha Jin, once the two men had settled themselves in the plush leather chairs that angled toward one another. \"It is an honor to be here,\" President Ha Jin said in fluent English hardly an accent. \"Well,\" President-Regent Langley said, \"let's see how you feel after you've had some of my wife's cooking.\" Laughter from the press corps, flashbulbs popping. President Ha Jin arched his eyebrows, playing confused. \"Interesting custom,\" he intoned. \"Should not Cynthia Hannigan be cooking tonight's meal? She is, after all, the true First Lady.\" President-Regent Langley pretended to flick some lint off the knee of he pleated trousers. He wished he could reach across the small square table separating him from President Ha Jin and throttle him unconscious. Instead he plastered a pained smile across his face and said: \"Cynthia has been through a lot these past few months, as you're well aware. She isn't making public appearances just yet.\" He patted President Ha Jin on the shoulder and satisfied himself with the fantasy that he was doing much more violence to the man. \"Besides,\" he continued, \"young John is a mama's boy through and through, but Cynthia is hardly the First Lady. She is the President Mother. And on that note he flashed a toothier, more winning smile to the contingent of reporters \"I look forward to the day, hopefully soon, that our young President can have a real First Lady living by his side at the White House.\" \"Mm,\" President Ha Jin grunted. \"Then let us dispense with these niceties. Shall we sign the treaty?\" State department officials came in through the side door, bearing a small podium and a scroll with the treaty's text written upon it in a regal faux script. The terms were already set and approved by both nations' congresses this signing, too, was a nicety of its own kind. In exchange for the Chinese withdrawing its missile silos from the irradiated ruins of Hokkaido and its armies from beleaguered Honshu, allowing the Japanese people a self-determining government; the US had agreed to surrender the Beijing Five to Chinese custody, release control of its Pacific protectorates, and link the two nations' dynasties by marriage. The two statesmen each took a fountain pen. President Ha Jin stood and stooped over the podium to sign his name in Mandarin. He stepped aside and President-Regent Langley took his place. But before Langley could sign, Ha Jin stopped him. \"I do not believe,\" President Ha Jin said, \"according to your fine nation's constitution, that the Vice President has the power to sign any bills or treaties into law.\" President-Regent Langley's false smile dropped from his face. He allowed himself to appear angered projecting strength with regards to his claim on the Presidency was paramount. \"Don't be silly, now,\" he said. \"I am the acting President. Our constitution is very clear on this. I may sign bills into law.\" \"Nonetheless, I would rather John Hannigan sign the treaty, assuming he is literate. And I would like to see him, anyway. I was quite fond of his father, you will recall and since the young boy is soon to marry my daughter, I want to make his acquaintance.\" President-Regent Langley stopped himself from grimacing. This was a power play, naked and unashamed. He could buck back, join into a pissing contest assert firmly the legitimacy of his signature on the treaty. He wanted to, if only for his personal sense of pride. But more paramount than his claim on the Oval Office was that this treaty be successful. He would allow the Chinese no grounds on which to later dispute its terms. \"Have it your way,\" he said, cordially. \"President Hannigan just recently learned to sign his name and I think he would be proud to show everyone how precocious he is.\" Langley turned and said to an aid: \"please, go fetch John.\" President Ha Jin grinned smugly, but Langley had his own way of saving face in front of the world's eyes: \"since we are involving the young President,\" he said, \"why don't you fetch Qingxiang? They'll be husband and wife soon enough they should meet, don't you agree?\" President Ha Jin's ruddy complexion went slightly paler. But with reporters excitedly snapping photos and filming, he had no justification for refusing this ostensibly friendly request. In Mandarin, he asked his own aide to go get Qingxiang. Some moments later, little John Hannigan III, 56th President of the United States and Outlaying Territories and Protectorates, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Head of State and Government, and Defender of Liberty, toddled into the room. He could hardly yet walk, but wore a dapper dark black fitted suit, a gray silk shirt with matching blue silk tie, pointed loafers and pressed trousers. He was, as the papers loved to say time and again, the spitting image of his recently late father. President-Regent Langley knelt, the joints in his knees crackling. \"John,\" he said, \"we need you to sign your name.\" \"Sign my name!\" he said. \"Sign my name!\" He hopped up and down a couple times. \"That's right, John. Can you do that for us?\" \"Uh-huh!\" John's personal aides offered to get a hassock for him to stand upon so he could reach the podium to sign, but President-Regent Langley waved them off. Instead, he held John under the armpits and hoisted him up to the proper height. The press loved it, American and Chinese alike. John chewed on his tongue, trying his darnedest to sign neatly, just like he had been taught, though the result was still a splotchy chicken scratch that scrawled across the page. Langley beamed proudly while he held the young President. President Ha Jin blanched. Only someone like Langley could turn public humiliation at the hands of the Chinese into such a PR coup. That was why he was regent, after all. Soon after the signing was completed, President-Regent Langley suggested that the two signatories should finalize the treaty with a handshake. He relished the image of President Ha Jin bending forward to shake the hand of a toddler. You wanted to do your diplomacy with a child you got it, he thought bitterly. President Ha Jin's aides returned to the Blue Room with Qingxiang Jin in tow. She was two years older than John, and tall even for her age, so that side-by-side she seemed to tower over him. Her face was pale, and almost gaunt, her long raven hair often concealing her eyes. \"Hi,\" John said to his fiancee, \"I'm President Hannigan!\" \"I am Qingxiang,\" the girl said, struggling with what pieces of English she knew. Without prompting, the young President waddled forward and wrapped his arms around the girl he would soon wed. The girl went stiff, not sure how to respond, but with all eyes upon her she decided it would be best to hug him back. The press could not resist letting forth a chorus of awws and other heartwarmed cooing. President-Regent Langley felt like vomiting. But then Langley felt something else stirring inside him, as he watched the tiny girl. She didn't know what to do she kept glancing back at her father, who would give her no guidance, not even a simple nod or a shake of the head. President-Regent Langley considered the grim life that lay ahead of this girl. Yes, John liked her now, in his youthful naivety. But he would be raised to despise her. And thenceforth she would be a virtual prisoner in this foreign country, cut off from her family and all possibility of friends. She would be excluded from all government functions and distrusted by the people of both nations. Perhaps once or twice, when the couple came of age, John would joylessly rut inside of her and thereby produce the heirs that were the chief project of this marriage. And beyond this, her life would have no meaning. \"Let's hang out,\" John said, pulling back from the hug. \"We can play blocks!\" \"Blocks...\" Qingxiang said. \"Or dinosaurs! Do you like dinosaurs too?\" Qingxiang, startled and baffled, once more cast a glance back at her father, and once more received no help. She looked back at the young President. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I also like dinosaurs.\" \"What's your favorite?\" \"Erm Triceratops, I think.\" \"I like that one too,\" John said, nodding sagely. \"But T-Rex is my favorite. I have both, though. We can play them together!\" \"Hmm, that sounds fun.\" Langley did not like this. Neither did Ha Jin. But it was happening in public, and who were they to deny the two young lovebirds a play date? That would be a public relations disaster.

Do you like dinosaurs too?\" Qingxiang, startled and baffled, once more cast a glance back at her father, and once more received no help. She looked back at the young President. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I also like dinosaurs.\" \"What's your favorite?\" \"Erm Triceratops, I think.\" \"I like that one too,\" John said, nodding sagely. \"But T-Rex is my favorite. I have both, though. We can play them together!\" \"Hmm, that sounds fun.\" Langley did not like this. Neither did Ha Jin. But it was happening in public, and who were they to deny the two young lovebirds a play date? That would be a public relations disaster. For the first time, neither man felt like they had a real grip on power after all."}

{"original_text": "Our world is made up of numbers. For instance, take Malcolm. He's been my best friend since I was thirteen, when our powers first manifested and we were snatched up by the government agency that trains and regulates people with special abilities like us. Malcolm is a telekinetic, one of the most powerful I've ever seen. He can lift entire buildings or crush a man's skull without much effort. But with great power comes great responsibility, and Malcolm has always been keenly aware of that. He's used his abilities to help people, both within and outside the agency, and he's saved countless lives. On the other hand, there's Amy, a precognitive who can see into the future. She's been nothing but trouble since the day she arrived at the agency, always causing chaos with her predictions and her reckless behavior. She's been sanctioned more times than I can count, and I'm not sure how much longer the agency will put up with her. Then there's me, the numbers guy. I'm not sure why they chose me for this role, but I've always been good with numbers and patterns. I can analyze data and come up with predictions almost as well as Amy can, but without the headaches and the visions. I'm not as flashy as Malcolm or as wild as Amy, but I like to think I bring a steady hand to the team. We may be different, but we all have one thing in common: we're part of a bigger picture. The agency may be trying to control us, but we're trying to use our powers for good. And maybe, just maybe, we can make a difference in this world of numbers.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "In our series of letters from sci-fi fans, writer and novelist Ian Somerhalder explains why he's chosen to be part of a government agency that trains and regulates people with special abilities."}

Do you know how much we get if we bail? Nothing. I prefer him showing up late and getting paid.\" Kyle hunched his shoulders together, making his already thin body smaller than seemed possible. I had to suppress a chuckle. If Kyle got any more wound up his head might pop off. Still, he had a point, being nervous. But it wasn't the client being late that had me nervous. Everything had gone according to plan. Better actually. We were all in and out like ghost: no witnesses, no complications, and no trace. It was a perfect heist. And perfect bothers me. I'm not one of those pretentious \"perfect doesn't exist\" types, but I've never been part of anything that's gone this well. My marriage wasn't perfect. Hell, I blew that one bad. Sure as hell a shitty father. My little girl won't even talk to me on the phone anymore. Now I can't even get a real job. But this job will fix that. After tonight, I get back on my feet. After tonight, I can afford three hots and a cot again. Maybe I'm just being paranoid. A lot depends on this job going well and I'm just stressing out. Could have sworn my hair was falling out again. Hasn't done that since the divorce. It's probably nothing. \"Goddamit Kyle would you stop fidgeting!\" Raul hissed \"It's making me all sorts of uncomfortable.\" \"Can't help it\" Kyle protested. A smile grew on his face until it reached his eyes. \"I can't stop thinking about what I'm gon na do with my cut.\" He let the silence linger for a moment, hoping it would allow his partners to arrive at the same euphoric realization. \"A quarter mill, each,\" adding emphasis on the last word. \"We don' got our money yet,\" Raul stated with thinly veiled irritation. Raul wouldn't have even bought Kyle with them if he could, but no one could break through firewalls as quick as Kyle. More importantly Kyle was even better at not leaving any digital fingerprints behind. When it came to doing tech quick and clean, Kyle was the best, as long as he didn't have a panic attack. But despite the odds, Kyle kept it together two-hundred and fifty grand had that effect on people. \"No need to shit on my parade Raul. Speaking of which.\" Kyle leapt to his fit with a graceless jolt as he headed off to the restroom. Rauled scowled at his back. \"Just make it quick.\" A period of silence lingered. Normally that would bother me, but Raul was a guy who you hang out with in silence and not feel the impulse to start small talk just to break the silence. It was comfortable, professional even. Which caused his breaking the silence to catch me by surprise. \"What are you gon na spend it on. You're cut I mean.\" I'm going to build the life of a man my daughter can be proud of. I shrugged, \"Probably move to nicer apartment to start with. Maybe start using my powers for good instead of evil.\" Raul smirked. He never laughed. \"Yeah, you'll start shitting rainbows and sunshine will come out you're ass.\" He studied his feet for a moment, then looked up at me. \"You were never really meant for this life,\" he stated. He wasn't being rude or condescending. Just stating a fact. I didn't fit in. I saw something more with my life. I always believe on a way out. Kyle didn't care for one, Raul didn't have a choice. He made too many bad decisions with the wrong people. He stopped believing on a way out a long time ago. Before I could respond, the bathroom door shot open, and Kyle marched out clutching his gut. \"You might not want to go in there. Smells like, well, shit.\" Kyle collapsed back into his chair, still clutching his gut. \"That did not feel good.\" Before Raul could say whatever obscene thought was on his mind, the radio on his belt yelled up at him. \"Yo, got that SUV pullin' in. I think that's our guy,\" said the cheery voice on the radio. \"Got it Ben. Stay up there and keep an eye out,\" Raul stated with obvious relief on his voice. I glanced down at my phone to see it was 12:59. Nope, 1:00 now. \"Got to hand it to this guy, hell of an entrance,\" I said with as much sarcasm I could muster. \"It'll be even better if he comes with the mill' he owes us,\" Raul reminded. The job wasn't over, and Raul didn't let any of us forget it. Ever. The black SUV pulled into the warehouse, obviously, this guy watched way to many movies. But if his money was good, I guess I could let it slide. Still, I guess I should give him some slack. He's giving me a second chance with Julie, even though he doesn't know it. It may not work out, but this man is giving me what I need to gain my daughters respect again. And maybe someday, her love. A man with wearing an jet black suit stepped out of the driver's door. with his all black attire, he would have blended in entirely with the darkness behind him if his shoes didn't shine with the little light that existed. \"You have my crate?\" he asked, monotonously. \"You got our money?\" Raul responded, completely disinterest with everything else. \"First I want to see the product, make sure it's still in the box.\" The coldness of his voice was matched only by the condescesion it carried with it. Raul and I shared an uncomfortable glance. \"You asked us to get the crate. It's still locked and sealed, you can see that easy enough,\" Raul explained, as though one professional to another. \"I don't give a damn what's in it, but I did a job, and now I get paid.\" Even though there was only thirty feet between the client and Raul, it seemed to grow farther than that. This has to go down right, it has to. A few moments existed before the client responded. \"Either you open the chest, and show me whats inside, or I walk away, and you get to keep your bounty.\" A thin smile formed on his face, \"But how long do you think it will take for the cops to track down government property?\" Glancing over at Raul, I immediately saw Raul calculating whether it was worth dumping someplace if we weren't paid. But we had to get paid. I had to get paid. \"Raul,\" I breathed. He snapped his head towards me. I showed weakness in a negotiation, and left us with little choice. He walked over to the wall and pick up a crowbar. I quickly rushed to get the lock open and was able to break through it with a pair of bolt cutters. Raul and Kyle walked over with the crowbars and started pulling up on the metal crate. I watched them eagerly, praying that what we found in the metal box was what our client was looking for. As the lid slowly started to lift, I started getting nauseous. Just nervousness, the next few seconds decided my future. \"It's about to give\" Kyle cheered. Over Kyle's shoulder, I saw a report of our heist, and it showed what we stole: experimental thorium. Despite the muted volume, I could see the reporters lips form a word, no, a sentence. Lethal. We were about to open a crate of radioactive material. WE'RE TRYING TO OPEN IT! \"Wait!\" I tried to warn, but my yell was drowned by the loud metallic pop of the lid breaking its seal. It was then that I felt it. Heat, worming through my flesh, holding every nerve entralled, unable to act on its own. I tried to warn my partners again, but instead of words, vomit came up. It came up again, and again, and again. It quickly changed from vomit to blood. Then to bits of flesh came up with the blood. I collapsed. Looking over at Raul and Kyle, I saw their faces blistered and burned. They got the full brunt of it, they got quick deaths. I envied them for a moment. \"Excellent,\" the client said with his typical monotonous voice. He was wearing a Hazmat suit now. When did he get that on? Why wasn't I paying attention to him? \"It's exactly what I wanted.\" I was breathing heavily, desperately trying to fill what was left of my lungs with air. Every attempt to yell or scream shot burning pain through my throat. \"The client looked over his shoulder.

{"original_text": "\"Don't hang up!\" All I could say was \"Okay.\" I obviously wasn't going to hang up. Who does that? Who out there is answering their phones and hanging up immediately? Nobody. But for some reason, he felt the need to repeat the request a few more times. \"All right,\" he said, \"this is going to sound crazy, but don't hang up I'm you. From the future.\" \"Uh huuuuh.\" \"Don't hang up!\" \"Okay.\" \"Here, I'll prove it. Don't hang up. What time is it?\" I checked my watch. \"Six o'clock.\" \"Okay,\" he said. \"You are watching....the news.\" He was, in fact, correct. \"Uh, yeah,\" I said, \"I am. What's the top story gon na be?\" \"Fuck if I know. You're not paying attention.\" Two for two. I decided to trust myself, for now, if only because I had nothing better to do. \"I need you to do something, right now. I need you to do what I say and not ask questions. Our lives are depending on this. Got it?\" \"Yeah, okay.\" \"Good. All right, how much cash do you have on you?\" I ruffled through my pockets for my wallet to find that I had seven dollars exactly. I reported the amount to my future self. \"Good, good,\" he said. \"That should be just enough. Now hurry get on the number ten bus on Fourth and Main. It'll leave in two minutes.

I normally took the elevator, but thankfully I knew where the stairs were; I took them two, three at a time. I burst outside and ran to the corner, and made it to the stop with only seconds to spare. Wheezing, I slid two singles into the fare machine and took an open seat. I was out of shape. \"All right,\" I gasped into the phone. \"I made it.\" No answer. \"Hey, you there?\" \"Oh, yeah, sorry,\" he said, fumbling to respond. \"I was just..... there was a thing.\" \"A thing?\" \"Yeah. Can't tell you about it. Might..... alter the future vortex..... or whatever.\" I grew somewhat skeptical. \"You have no idea what you're talking about, do you?\" \"Give me some credit,\" he said. \"You wouldn't know either way. But trust me, this thing you're doing is important.\" I sighed. What did I have to lose? \"What next?\" I asked. \"What?\" \"Where's my stop?\" \"Oh! Sorry. Right. Yes. Umm..... Fourth and Johnson.\" I pulled the cord and got off the bus. Further directions led me to a small thrift store. \"Aisle three.\" Oh god, what had happened here? It was if a tornado wreaked through leaving behind a trail of chaos and affordable prices. On one shelf sat a set of porcelain dolls, on another a three-armed Spider-man action figure standing proudly amongst several cartons of cigarettes. A jar of bottle caps here, obsolete tower computer there, booster packs of Pokemon card knockoffs strewn amongst rolls of aluminum foil. There was no organization, no order, and no conceivable attribute that all these things could possibly share..... except that each one was labeled with a five-dollar price tag. \"Keep walking forward until you see the red cardigan on your left.\" I did as instructed. The cardigan was easy enough to spot; its bright color stood out like the undercover police officer at my thirteenth birthday party. \"Okay, now what?\" \"Reach behind it and feel around. You're looking for a box that's about five by six inches.\" I pressed the phone against my shoulder with my ear so I could grope around with both hands. After a bit of searching, I wrapped my hands around a box wrapped in tight plastic that felt like the dimensions described to me. \"I think I got it,\" I told him. \"Take it,\" he said.

From the future.\" \"Uh huuuuh.\" \"Don't hang up!\" \"Okay.\" \"Here, I'll prove it. Don't hang up. What time is it?\" I checked my watch. \"Six o'clock.\" \"Okay,\" he said. \"You are watching....the news.\" He was, in fact, correct. \"Uh, yeah,\" I said, \"I am. What's the top story gon na be?\" \"Fuck if I know. You're not paying attention.\" Two for two. I decided to trust myself, for now, if only because I had nothing better to do. \"I need you to do something, right now. I need you to do what I say and not ask questions. Our lives are depending on this. Got it?\" \"Yeah, okay.\" \"Good. All right, how much cash do you have on you?\" I ruffled through my pockets for my wallet to find that I had seven dollars exactly. I reported the amount to my future self. \"Good, good,\" he said. \"That should be just enough. Now hurry get on the number ten bus on Fourth and Main. It'll leave in two minutes.

{"original_text": "It was a Braun clock: Sleek minimalistic design - mostly just an LCD screen on a black polymer rectangle. Before he had opened the box he had been sure it was his latest order from amazon for novels and action figures, but found it instead. A missent package. He thought. And clearly broken: The clock was telling the wrong time: 1459 hours. No M or AM. Just the minutes, seconds and milliseconds in white digits. When he put the clock away he noticed the type-writer written paper under it. He took it out of the box and read it. \"When this clock hits zero, you will die.\" There was nothing else but that. He stared at the note, feeling blank for a moment. This always happened: No matter how many chain mails he received or comments he saw online saying'If you don't resend thisread this your familyyou will die', he always felt that small fear and dread. There was always that irrational second where he believed it, considered it, but then he would be free of that all. That just never happened. Yes, even if you think ' that will never happen'it's not the sign that it will. Real life had no time for such nonsense. He looked at clock and again, seeing the time. 1458 hours. That was a couple of days. 2 months. In two months he would die, apparently. \"Guess I've better make up for the lost time. \" He said. He had a strange indescribable feeling of deja vu. It sort of felt like the plot to Richard Matheson's'Button, Button. Minus the choice. He had to hand it to them, as far as hoaxes went this one was well thought out. The clock did not look cheap at all. It was such a simple but effective way to screw with somebody, and he knew he'd be playing with the idea in his head even after he threw away and ignored the stuff. Strangely, he never got around to doing it. Life got in his way, or rather the glorious world of the internet did. He had guns to shoot, stuff to watch, parties to attend and regret getting too drunk at. Business as usual. One month down the line he remembered the clock again and looked at the timer. It was definitely broken. It seemed to have gone down more than before. It claimed he had 321 hours remaining to live. \"Huh.\" He said as he took an entire sip of the vodka he had by his computer. He watched as the digital display suddenly paused, and then the number knocked itself down. Now 320. \"What's up with that?\" It was unsettling. On a whim, he took another shot, and just like well - clockwork - the timer decreased again. This time by a few minutes. It took him another week to figure out that the time decreased or increased according to his habits. They were miniscule changes mostly though, and he tried to ignore it all, put the clock in a corner somewhere. He still couldn't get himself to get rid of it though. Frustrated at the claim that he had only 72 hours to live, he tried to open it. And found it was impossible to: Literally. The thing had no screws to be unscrewed, and he knew that something was very wrong when in frustration, he tossed the clock on the floor and nothing happened. It made a loud crack as it went across, but when he picked it up it was completely unscarred. \"What the hell.\" He started jogging. He stopped smoking and drinking and tried to spend his time outside. There was a mixture of dread and relief as his time went up by 200 hours, but then it refused to budge after that. He gave up and spent his days wasted in his apartment, watching the cursed clock and thinking he'd gone mad somehow without noticing. As of May 31st, he was going to apparently die in 23 hours. He couldn't sleep or eat. Every time he convinced himself it was all a joke he took a hammer, a rock or anything to smash the clock and with his failure realized that something abnormal was going on here. He told his friend Trevor as much. \"You seriously expect me to believe this?\" Said Trevor, his friend. He was studying the clock. He wanted to strangle him, \"Do I look like I'm joking? I received this thing back in January. End January, like two months ago. And it's unbreakable. Try it.\" \"Unbreakable, huh.\" Trevor said, walking over to the window and tossing it out. \"What the hell man!\" He rushed to stop him, but was only in time to hear it smack the pavement. His apartment was on the third floor. \"Dude, you clearly need to get out more. \" Trevor said as he kicked an empty pizza box on the floor. \"Plus you stink. This whole room stinks. Get a shower and clean this place up before you make this whole building block a biohazard for godssake. Then, we're going out for some good old socialization.\" \"Dude \"20 minutes.\" Trevor said before taking a seat. So he took a shower. By the time he was done he felt like his head had broken water. It was all so silly, wasn't it? \"Wait. Tomorrow is April 1.\" He realized. The bastards. They had gotten him for sure. Hook line sinker and bait. This would be a great story to write about later. A definite legend to explain over drinks too. It had seriously messed him up. He laughed out loud. \"You ready?\" Trevor said when he was finally done with some rudimentary cleaning of the flat. It had been a pig sty at this point. He needed to sort that out. Maybe even get his life in order. If there was a silver lining to this whole nonsense, was that he could do a better job of taking care of himself. \"Let's go.\" He said. So they went out and had a great time. But the simple great time turned into a party, and he found himself out all night up until midnight. Business as usual. Trevor drove him back and supported him as he stumbled everywhere towards the apartment. He didn't even remember leaving the bar. \"You're the best man! The best!\" He slurred. \"I was seriously in the dumps man. That stupid clock screwed with me in more ways than one.\" Trevor didn't answer him. Was distracted by something. He was looking up at something in silence. \" Hey... \" That was when he smelt the smoke. He looked up and saw that the whole apartment block was on fire. Black smoke roiled out of the windows. There were screams, sirens. He'd been too drunk to even notice. \"I'm..... I'm gon na be...\" He stumbled away and got sick in a nearby gutter. He felt a little bit better. Adrenaline was kicking in to mediate the buzz. That was when he noticed the black shape sitting on the pavement. Looking at it, he recognized it for what it was. It was the clock. Damn thing was even sitting upright. The hours had gone up by a massive amount. He now had decades to live, apparently. One disaster alleviated, it was showing him the next time he was to die. \" ..... Nope.\" He said.
