{"original_text": "This article tells the story of how a startup was almost acquired by Facebook. It details how the company was founded, how it raised its initial investments, its growth, its dealings with Facebook, and ultimately how the acquisition fell through. The startup in question is a social networking platform called \"Social Loop.\" Founded in 2015, the platform allowed users to create and join interest-based groups, connect with likeminded people, and share content. Initially, the founders funded the company themselves and built the platform from scratch. However, they soon realized that they needed outside investment to take the company to the next level. In 2016, the founders managed to secure a seed investment of 500,000 from a group of angel investors. This funding allowed them to hire a team of developers and marketers and begin scaling the platform. Over the next two years, Social Loop grew rapidly, with thousands of users joining every month. The company also raised a further 3 million in venture capital funding in 2018, which helped accelerate its growth. Around this time, Social Loop caught the attention of Facebook. The social media giant was interested in the platform's unique approach to social networking, and saw potential in integrating some of its features into Facebook's own products. After a few months of discussions, Facebook made an offer to acquire Social Loop for 50 million. Initially, the founders were thrilled at the prospect of joining forces with Facebook. They saw the acquisition as a validation of their hard work, and a chance to take the platform to new heights. However, as the negotiations went on, they began to have second thoughts. For one thing, they were concerned about the impact of the acquisition on Social Loop's existing user base. Many of these users had joined the platform precisely because it wasn't owned by Facebook, and they were wary of the social media giant's privacy practices. The founders worried that if Social Loop became part of Facebook, these users would abandon the platform in droves. Another issue was the founders' vision for the future of the platform. They had big plans for Social Loop, including expanding into new markets and developing new features. However, they were unsure whether these plans would be given the priority they deserved within Facebook's vast organization. Ultimately, the founders decided to turn down Facebook's offer. Although it was a difficult decision, they felt that it was the best one for the long-term health of the company. They continued to develop Social Loop, and eventually sold it to another buyer for 70 million, more than Facebook's offer. The story of Social Loop is a cautionary tale for any startup that is approached by a larger company for acquisition.

If you often find yourself googling stuff like \"vertical align not working,\" you might want to keep reading. CSS layouts can be tricky, but mastering them is essential for creating modern, responsive websites. Here are a few tips to help you out: 1. Use Flexbox for simple layouts: Flexbox is a powerful CSS layout system that allows you to create flexible, responsive layouts with just a few lines of code. It's great for simple layouts where you need to align items vertically or horizontally. 2. Use Grid for complex layouts: Grid is another CSS layout system that's great for complex layouts with multiple rows and columns. It allows you to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, and is perfect for creating magazine-style designs. 3. Avoid floats: Floats used to be the go-to method for creating layouts, but they can be unpredictable and hard to work with. Flexbox and Grid are much more powerful and reliable, and should be used instead. 4. Try out CSS Grid Garden: If you're new to Grid, try out the fun and educational game CSS Grid Garden. It'll teach you the basics of Grid in a playful and engaging way. 5. Use modals sparingly: Modals are great for displaying information or forms that the user needs to interact with, but they can be overused. Try to use them only when necessary, and consider alternatives like showing and hiding elements instead. By mastering CSS layouts, you'll be able to create beautiful, responsive designs that work across all devices.

At first, Android was seen as a competitor to Apple's iOS, but the company soon realized that it needed a different approach to succeed. Haase writes about the company's decision to make Android an open-source project that could be used by any device manufacturer, a move that proved to be crucial in the OS's eventual success. In the second chapter excerpted by the article, Haase delves into the challenges of building the first Android devices. According to Haase, the team faced many technical hurdles in those early days, including creating a touch screen interface that was responsive and developing an efficient battery management system. He also writes about the difficulties of working with multiple device manufacturers, each with their own unique hardware configurations and technical requirements. Overall, \"Android: A Memoir\" promises to be an insightful read for anyone interested in the history of mobile technology or the behind-the-scenes workings of one of the world's most beloved operating systems.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "As the mobile operating system (OS) Android continues to grow in popularity, its early days have been covered in a number of books and articles on the subject."}

{"original_text": "Synthetic wavelength holography is a new non-line-of-sight method that can rapidly capture full-field images of large areas with submillimeter precision. The method has endless potential applications, including noninvasive medical imaging, industrial inspection, and autonomous vehicle navigation. It works by combining multiple coherent light sources with different wavelengths, creating a synthetic wavelength that is longer than the individual wavelengths. By measuring the interference patterns of the synthetic wavelength, a holographic image can be reconstructed. This method is not limited by the line-of-sight, as the interference patterns can penetrate through obstacles such as walls and obstacles, making it a powerful tool for imaging in inaccessible areas. Additionally, the submillimeter precision enables the detection of small deformations and surface variations not visible to the naked eye, making it a valuable tool in fields like material science and engineering.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have developed a new holographic imaging method that can be used in a wide range of applications, including medical imaging, industrial inspection, and autonomous vehicle navigation."}

The researchers noticed that the diffuse aurora would momentarily dim certain parts of the active auroral band, as if erasing them. Further analysis revealed that this was due to a type of plasma wave that has never been seen before. This discovery highlights the complex and ever-evolving nature of auroras and the importance of continued research in understanding them."}

{"original_text": "Singapore currently produces about 10 percent of its food. Due to climate change and population growth, it aims to produce 30 percent of its food by 2030. In order to achieve this goal, the Singaporean government has implemented several initiatives to boost local food production. Some of these initiatives include: 1. Vertical farming: Singapore is promoting the use of vertical farming to maximise the use of limited land resources. Vertical farms take up less space while yielding more crops per unit of land compared to traditional farming methods. 2. Rooftop farming: Rooftop farming is a new trend that is gaining popularity in cities around the world, and Singapore is no exception. Rooftop farms are built on top of buildings, using previously unused space to grow crops. 3. Indoor farming: With the use of hydroponics and LED lighting, indoor farming can grow crops year-round, regardless of weather conditions, and with significantly less water than traditional farming methods. 4. Aquaponics: Aquaponics is a combination of aquaculture (the farming of fish) and hydroponics (growing plants in water). The waste produced by fish is used to fertilise plants, while the plants help to clean the water for the fish. This method requires less water than traditional farming methods. 5. Education and support: The government is also putting in efforts to educate and support individuals and organisations who want to participate in local food production. This includes providing grants, training and technical support.

{"original_text": "Scientists have 3D printed cyanobacteria and graphene onto a mushroom in order to produce electricity. Shining a light on the cyanobacteria will kickstart their photosynthesis, which causes them to give off a bit of electricity called \"photocurrent.\" The graphene is able to conduct and collect the electricity, while the mushroom keeps the cyanobacteria alive (they are hard to keep alive outside of artificial conditions). Currently, an array of these mushrooms is enough to power an LED light, but we are still a ways off from powering larger electronic devices.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "Scientists have 3D printed cyanobacteria and graphene onto a mushroom in order to produce electricity.

{"original_text": "The Senate's new infrastructure bill may shape the future of cryptocurrency in the US. The bill promises public spending on major projects and it proposes taxes on crypto brokers to fund the projects. There are two competing amendments, one that exempts miners, hardware manufacturers, and developers, and another that only exempts proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. The definition of brokers in the original bill was so broad that anyone involved in cryptocurrency services would have to report to the IRS information on their customers, which would be impossible for most of the industry. The vote on the rival amendments is expected to take place on Saturday.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "The Senate's new infrastructure bill may shape the future of cryptocurrency in the US.

{"original_text": "Jupiter's moon Europa is about the size of Earth and completely covered in ice. Scientists think that Europa has saltwater oceans, which is exciting because this means that it is possible that Europa might have the conditions necessary for life to exist. In recent years, NASA has been exploring the possibility of sending a mission to Europa to study its oceans and search for signs of life beneath the icy surface. The mission would involve landing a probe on the surface of Europa and using instruments to drill through the ice and explore the ocean below. This could potentially be a major breakthrough in our understanding of the potential for life in our solar system.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "0", "text": "Jupiter's moon Europa is about the size of Earth and completely covered in ice.
