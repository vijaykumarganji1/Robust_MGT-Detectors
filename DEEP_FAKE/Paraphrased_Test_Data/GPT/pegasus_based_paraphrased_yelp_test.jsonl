{"original_text": "So extremely disappointed. My mother booked two nights at the Stratosphere for a much needed couples week-end with my husband. She used Expedia.

When I did I was told hotel did not have our reservation from Expedia yet and call back day before. When I called a day before I was told rudely we were in the old un remodeled part of the tower in two queen bed and it was to late to make changes. Once we got there we did get one queen bed but very far from the pool and with a horrible view of the rooftop of another building and depressing North Las Vegas. We ate diner at Mac gross -the most pathetic attempt at a steak house. Gross. The pool closes at 7. There is only ONE POOL and it's full of kids in clothes. Sunday we slept in. Skipped brunch an decided to have dinner in the tower at 11:00pm. Everything was closed (with exception of the diner) club 107 had only 4 appetizers available out of the entire menu. None appetizing. By the way.... We had to pay 15 per person per day to. Use the facilities as a guest of the hotel! WTF?! That was 90 extra for a gross kid filled jacuzzi and a pool that closed at 7! A restaurant that closed too early to enjoy and a stinky old room with a debtor easing view. No wonder 7 people have committed suicide here!

Three entrees and I sampled all of them. The marinara dipping sauce was heavy with tomato paste and not at all a good marinara. The clams swam in a broth so salty, it made my lips swell up like a pontoon boat. The fried calamari and artichoke were fried to a delicious, white coloration which, in the realm of fried foods, was about fourteen hues down from golden brown.

I ordered an antipasto for two thinking I'd go light with meats, cheese, and relishes. Another huge disappointment. It looked like a salad with two buried slices of capicolla deep within and two, also buried, slices of salami. The remainder of the bowl was small bits of red and yellow peppers, about thirty pepperoncini, but mostly romaine tops. This was anything but a traditional antipasto, with the majority of the bowl comprised of lettuce. I don't know why IG hides the meat and cheese, but it pissed me off. I felt like the catcher in a game of hide the salami. Literally! I had to ask for bread since the antipasto was a bust.

{"original_text": "My husband and I wanted to try something new for date night and I've known about Bachi Burger for years through Yelp as one of the best burgers in Las Vegas as well as all of my friends constantly obsessing over it. We got here on a Friday night with a 25 minute wait which wasn't a big deal because we just walked over to Patty's closet to kill time. My in-laws said we have to try the salty caramel toasted marshmallow milkshake and we did. I'd say this was the best item of the night! It was a bit overly sweet, but still so addicting. We then ordered the oxtail chilli cheese fries as our appetizer to share. Upon first bite, I told my husband it was cold. I don't know if they made the fries and chilli and were just waiting for the fried egg to be put on top, but the food was definitely lukewarm by the time it was brought out to us and I like my food super hot, like it was made fresh.

We got here on a Friday night with a 25 minute wait which wasn't a big deal because we just walked over to Patty's closet to kill time. My in-laws said we have to try the salty caramel toasted marshmallow milkshake and we did. I'd say this was the best item of the night! It was a bit overly sweet, but still so addicting. We then ordered the oxtail chilli cheese fries as our appetizer to share. Upon first bite, I told my husband it was cold. I don't know if they made the fries and chilli and were just waiting for the fried egg to be put on top, but the food was definitely lukewarm by the time it was brought out to us and I like my food super hot, like it was made fresh.

They closed down, let everyone know that they were coming back better than ever next year, and then they went to work. The first thing they did was to take a hard look at the branding of the casino. They realized that the old branding was tired and outdated, and that they needed to create something fresh and new that would attract a younger, more dynamic crowd. They spent months working with branding experts and designers to come up with a new look and feel for the casino. They developed a new logo that was sleek and modern, with bold colors and dynamic graphics. They also revamped the interior of the casino, redesigning the gaming floors to be more open and inviting. Once the new branding and design were in place, they began marketing the casino aggressively. They launched social media campaigns, created eye-catching advertisements, and partnered with influencers and celebrities to promote the launch of the new casino. Finally, the day came when the doors of the new casino opened. People streamed in from all over the city and beyond, eager to see what this new and improved casino had to offer. And they were not disappointed. The new casino was a hit, attracting a younger, more diverse crowd than ever before. Thanks to its fresh branding and dynamic marketing, the casino was able to reinvent itself and become a major player in the gaming industry once again. It just goes to show how important branding and marketing are in any business, and how they can turn a failing enterprise into a thriving one.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "In our series of letters from African-American journalists, film-maker and columnist Sharon Florentine looks at some of the ways African-Americans are using social media to connect with their audiences."}

We got seated immediately and had fast, happy service, and that's where the enjoyable portion of this review ends. The food was mediocre at best, and after having dined in Le Village Buffet next door I'm certain they share the same kitchen. This means you're paying more for your single serving breakfast that you would be paying the 15 for the buffet. I suppose if you really wanted to avoid the lines at the buffet and didn't mind shelling out for each glass of juice you wanted this would be alright.

{"original_text": "For a place open just a matter of weeks The Spot seems to be off to a great start. We arrived to a full house on Saturday evening and settled onto some stools at the bar to enjoy a beer before a table was ready for us. The bar selection was good and the bartender was enthusiastic and welcoming. Built within an old house, The Spot is small; there were only about 10 tables and about 4-6 spots at the bar. Rumor has it there is some outdoor seating but it was a bit too chilly to take advantage of that! They aren't currently taking reservations but who knows if that will change down the road. The ambiance is quite nice; freshly done woodwork, soft lighting, and lined with black white photos on the dark red walls. If I had my choice, the best seats in the house are probably in the bar area or the booths up by the front windows. Two of the booths are right by the kitchen window which has pros and cons; some people love seeing behind the curtain and watching the action. I, on the other hand, find fluorescent kitchen lights to be my kryptonite so I'd rather stick to the more romantic corners of the space. The menu had many tempting options on it for both the vegetarian and the carnivore. Prices were reasonable and a lot sounded tasty. We started with the Baked Artichoke Remikin (6.50) which was served with pickled carrots and crusty bread. We enjoyed it thoroughly; it was a good portion for two or three. For entrees I had the Portabella stew (11) which I enjoyed and the Mister settled on the Wild Boar Sausage (14) and was also pleased. Portions were fair sized, enough for dinner for each of us, not really enough to take home for lunch the next day. Both entrees were served with a side of cooked greens and polenta. The greens were good, the polenta was so salty even Mr.-High-Blood-Pressure himself wasn't interested. This is where The Spot's interest in customer service became evident: our server noticed both of us were bypassing the polenta asked for feedback, which we provided. He did say the kitchen team is still tweaking things and trying to improve everything, of course, so they appreciate hearing customer's thoughts on the food. (Well, you know we're not shy!). We provided feedback on the polenta but assured him that overall they seem to be in great shape. A few minutes later, the owner offered us a complimentary dessert due to the polentapalooza. Yum!

The mignonette was my fave condiment for the oysters while the yummy dijonnaise was best for the mussels. The mussels were so good, we ordered another dozen! Cauliflower Soup - topped with fried capers; very rich and creamy and cauliflowery. The capers did much to provide an additional dimension to the otherwise 1D soup. Beet Salad - Red beets topped with some fruit, half crispy with small seeds (like a kiwi). Refreshing! Duck Confit - Served atop halved roasted brussel sprouts. The duck was pure and game-y, as duck confit should be as it's cooked in its own fat. I encouraged my hubby to pick up the bone and gnaw off the crispy parts. Magnificent. Croque Monsieur - served with shoestring fries; appropriately rich with the sauce and sunnyside egg on top but not overly salty like other versions I've had. Gnocchi a la Parisienne - I decided on this dish thinking it would be lighter and make up for all the food we had beforehand. Boy, was I wrong. First off, these aren't potato dumplings. They are pan-fried herbed flour dumplings sauteed with fennel, eggplant and other stuff. I thought it was delicious but the oil at the bottom of the dish indicated it wasn't the light fare I expected.

WHAT A MISTAKE! I began having second thoughts when I walked through the casino to the elevators; the check-in was ok, though they wanted to charge me extra for being an hour early and sent me to get a rewards card to avoid the fee.

I heard whispers about town that the food at this Vig was going to be better than their other locations.

The outside eating area and bar are just perfect for the fall weather. The design is simple, cohesive, friendly warm. The praise stops there. We ordered chips guac. The chips tasted like they were fried in old oil, and the guac had a flavor that certainly wasn't guac-licious.... more on the verge of going bad. One person joining us had the deconstructed tacos, which she barely touched, as the fish was more like fish jerky, and the side of beans totally tasteless. I shared the best turkey sandwich with someone, and had high expectations with a name like that. It was a soggy mess of flavors. None of the ingredients stuck out, and it quickly fell apart after the first bite. Nothing was exceptional.

When we arrived, they sat us right away at a round banquette that overlooked the entire restaurant from the back of the room. Perfect location. The interior was festive but collected and calm at the same time. Very tastefully done. We went there specifically for the tasting menu, which my boyfriend had had before and loved. It was the most impressive meal I've had, not just because of the food but because we were served by a TEAM. There was the bread guy, the busser guy, the wine guy, and the main server. They could not have been more polite, attentive, or friendly. thinking we were jsut getting tastes of wine parings for each dish, we started out with a bottle of white but we sure didn't need it - each pairing was a full glass of the most perfect wine. The wine guy (our own personal sommolier) gave a description of each after pouring, and the only complaint was that he was soft spoken so we had a hard time hearing him. They were all probably a bunch of adjectives anyway, we're not wine snobs so we didn't care too much. I had to try real hard not to till up with each dish, knowing there was more to come - 8 dishes in all. God, it was SOOOOO good. After that I was so full of wine and stuffed with incredible food I just went back to our hotel and zonked out!;-P For anyone looking for a memorable dining experience, there's lots of celebrity chef restaurants out there but this one was really worth it. The bill came out to about 300 for two with tip, I believe (i just glanced at it as he opened it) Not bad at all.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "Just had a very memorable experience her this past weekend.

{"original_text": "I've been to a few other places for dim sum, so my opinion is somewhat biased. For the record, I'm also your standard adventure-seeking gringo, inspired by Andrew Zimmern. So, the wife and I decided to check out Mekong for their dim sum brunch. Now, the prices are extremely fair. There are 4 pricing categories for their dim sum, A, B, C, and D. All choices A through C are priced at 2.18, while D is priced at 4.95. Sodas are sold by the can, so we chose to have one can each of cola and we shared a pot of tea. We're not picky, but we chose not to indulge on the lovely assortments of buntype dishes that were presented to us. Instead, we focused our attention and appetite on the pork, chicken, and seafood offerings. And boy, we were not disappointed with the food! Some of our treats included shrimp shumai, chicken and shrimp crispy spring rolls, pork spare ribs with black bean sauce (basically just a serving of pork fat with some bone in it, but incredibly tasty), taro cakes, sharkfin dumplings, and several others. The servers were attentive, wheeling their cars around to every occupied table in the establishment. Well, all the servers except for one. I couldn't help but notice that one server seemed to avoid our table. At first, I thought it was my imagination. But then my wife noticed. In fact, I watched her as she pushed her cart past us while making an effort to look in the opposite direction! Of course, her cart had the items we were most interested in, so we were quite disappointed by her. Were it not for that one server, we'd be giving our experience here 5 stars. I purposely struck up a conversation with one of the other servers, a very pleasant young man, who was managing a cart that had the words beef organs on the side. I asked him what he was offering, and when he described it to me, I could not conceal my interest. He joked with us that he didn't think we'd be interested in his dish. Well, he was half right....my wife didn't want anything to do with it! That plate was very interesting. It consisted of various organ meats, including tripe and liver that I could identify, and several others I could not. All of the meats were very soft and tender, which is unusual for organ meats. My wife even tried some (what a trooper). We should all be glad I'm the one writing this review:) Another of the dishes we tried was a flat noodle with shrimp. Slippery devils, these were! I was having such a hard time picking these up with chopsticks that one of the other wait staff was attentive enough to offer us forks. He did it so politely that we joked with him to feign our offense, but we were actually quite thankful. The place settings do not include forks (an indication of their cultural authenticity, perhaps?) Oh, be thankful that there is a menu with pictures of each offering. Most of the servers do not speak fluent English. But when you ask them what they are serving, they can point to the picture and you can read it yourself! Overall, a fun experience. Plenty of food, at bargain prices. And before you leave, be sure to take a stroll through Mekong Plaza (the grocery store next door) and take in all the exotic tasties they have to offer.

The sound of the animals, the smell of freshly cut hay, and the sight of rolling hills all around me make me feel at peace. One of my favorite activities is to pick fresh produce from the farm to take back home. The farm has a variety of fruits and vegetables that are always in season. There's something about picking your own produce that makes it taste so fresh and delicious. The farm also offers horseback riding lessons, which is a fun way to spend an afternoon. The guides are knowledgeable and patient, which is great for beginners like myself. Overall, visiting the farm is a wonderful way to escape the hustle and bustle of city life and connect with nature. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful and rejuvenating experience.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "0", "text": "One of the most relaxing places that's within biking distance from my house.

Steak fajitas are plentifully, enchiladas are great, and the margaritas sound delicious. Thank you for the recommendation!

{"original_text": "Where is Eddie or Eddy????? I will not come here any longer if Eddie is not available. To the point a rude service. Technician never looked me in the eye and was turned away from me joking and yakking it up with her colleagues. The place looked like a bomb went off. I have been getting decent to good service till now. But this will be the end if Eddy is not available. Also: everyone of the technicians picks up or checks their personal phone..... While working on your feet or hands.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "Where is Eddie or Eddy????? I will not come here any longer if Eddie is not available. To the point a rude service.

{"original_text": "The service was very friendly and they get most of their stars for that. The menu was fairly limited compared to some of the other phoVietnamese food restaurants. The check in offer was a free order of egg rolls. Since we came early in the AM, he had to check if they had any prepared yet. Turns out they did, and they were fresh and delicious. But, unfortunately I am pretty sure they ended up charging us for it. The pho was bland and extremely forgettable. I really fail to see where these high ratings are stemming from. They skimped on everything AND the broth tasted like hot water until I added sriracha, then it tasted like sriracha water. The bathroom looked like it doubled as a broom closet. I don't have any reason to go back or recommend this place to friends.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "The service was very friendly and they get most of their stars for that.
