The man who had been in command of the New Earth Republic's greatest flagship, now called the New Earth Republic's last ship, stood up from the captain's chair. His scraggly white beard and short white hair, standing on end, gave him a mad look. \"Sir, we're here. We've arrived at the edge of our galaxy.\" \"Good.

How did you get in here?\" \"I've been here for some time. I thought you might appreciate a conversation on the trip.\" \"How did you get in here? There is no entrance to this room.\" \"I have a few friends, Captain. They helped me get here. I've been waiting for you to arrive.\" \"Arrive? Arrive where? Is this some sort of trick?\" \"It's no trick, Captain. The Universe is about to end. It has reached its expiration date. The Almighty One has come to see it off, and he brought me with him.

Even when he's standing right in front of them.\" \"You're a madman. Who are you? Where did you come from?\" \"I was a man once. Now I'm the Almighty One. And I'm here to see you off.\" \"I don't believe in you.\" \"You better start. Because I'm about to start the end of the Universe.

{"original_text": "Mohammed Peterson eased himself into a chair in the corner of a conference room. He liked coming early, since he was still new at the Centers for Disease Control. Being early demonstrated he was diligent and organized, two important qualities in a lab researcher. He also liked sitting in the corner, since it meant he could quietly mumble the names of those entering to himself. It was an exercise he learned in graduate school. He was bad with names, but that just meant he had to do more to remember them. Other researchers filed in, along with a few Senators, Congressmen, and military men. Sen. Mary Bunch of Utah and House Speaker Tatiana Zaitsev were the last to enter. They were the reason this team was assembled, and it took them seven years to finally make it to a team meeting. It had a name that seemed both august and bureaucratic - typical of the sensibilities of the Terran Coalition: The Intergalactic Tournament Molecular Biology Working Group. As Mary and Tatiana sat down Gen. Allen Carter of the Joint Chiefs of Staff addressed the group. He was always eager to get down to business. \"I know all of you are still busy even though we're switching gears on this project - development to refinement. However you may have noticed we have two special guests with us today. Senator Mary Bunch and Speaker Tatiana Zaitsev are here to learn some of the technical details of the organism the BWG has created. Dr. Kelley, can you bring us up to speed in a few minutes?\" Dr. Thomas Kelley, an industrious Scot with little hair left after a career in government medicine, led the Biology Working Group, shortened to BWG. He nodded slightly and addressed Tatiana and Mary directly. \"Our team, armed with the generous support you've convinced Congress to grant us, has been able to do more than achieve our goal - we've done it under budget and ahead of schedule.\" Mohammed suppressed a snort. Thomas was an expert in playing the intricate game that is managing a government-funded project. He fought hard for more time and money than he knew the BWG needed so he could say what he said. Past success means future grant funding is easier to get, after all. Kelly continued, \"The BWG was tasked with creating an organism that could infect and debilitate organisms originating from any of the 13 other planets that participate in the Galactic Tournament, but not those from Earth. We were able to exploit the bias of Earth-life toward the use of DNA and RNA to create a fast-growing virus that can reproduce at a tremendous pace - quickly enough to act within the seven-day tournament period. The mechanism of action is the a rapid depletion of body iron, which triggers a voracious appetite for metal-rich foods. The iron is secreted away in multiple areas of the body until approximately 72 hours after initial infection. At that time, the organism begins accreting iron around itself and moves to areas of heat. Body heat is generated in all of the 701 predators that have been submitted to the tournament since it began, and it's always found in two biological areas - the pump that circulates nutrients and the organ responsible for cognition. In humans, these are the heart and the brain. Our clinical trials have demonstrated this virus is 99.9 lethal after five days. One rare animal lingers through day eight, but after day five even that animal - the Tabithan Balrog, was practically a vegetable. Under the rules, it would have been disqualified by the Tournament.\" Mary's eyes betrayed a smile but her mouth remained neutral. \"What is the route of infection?\" she asked. Mohammed was surprised, and delighted, to hear this question asked. He noticed Kelley didn't mention the route of infection.

He liked coming early, since he was still new at the Centers for Disease Control. Being early demonstrated he was diligent and organized, two important qualities in a lab researcher. He also liked sitting in the corner, since it meant he could quietly mumble the names of those entering to himself. It was an exercise he learned in graduate school. He was bad with names, but that just meant he had to do more to remember them. Other researchers filed in, along with a few Senators, Congressmen, and military men. Sen. Mary Bunch of Utah and House Speaker Tatiana Zaitsev were the last to enter. They were the reason this team was assembled, and it took them seven years to finally make it to a team meeting. It had a name that seemed both august and bureaucratic - typical of the sensibilities of the Terran Coalition: The Intergalactic Tournament Molecular Biology Working Group. As Mary and Tatiana sat down Gen. Allen Carter of the Joint Chiefs of Staff addressed the group. He was always eager to get down to business. \"I know all of you are still busy even though we're switching gears on this project - development to refinement. However you may have noticed we have two special guests with us today. Senator Mary Bunch and Speaker Tatiana Zaitsev are here to learn some of the technical details of the organism the BWG has created. Dr. Kelley, can you bring us up to speed in a few minutes?\" Dr. Thomas Kelley, an industrious Scot with little hair left after a career in government medicine, led the Biology Working Group, shortened to BWG. He nodded slightly and addressed Tatiana and Mary directly. \"Our team, armed with the generous support you've convinced Congress to grant us, has been able to do more than achieve our goal - we've done it under budget and ahead of schedule.\" Mohammed suppressed a snort. Thomas was an expert in playing the intricate game that is managing a government-funded project. He fought hard for more time and money than he knew the BWG needed so he could say what he said. Past success means future grant funding is easier to get, after all. Kelly continued, \"The BWG was tasked with creating an organism that could infect and debilitate organisms originating from any of the 13 other planets that participate in the Galactic Tournament, but not those from Earth. We were able to exploit the bias of Earth-life toward the use of DNA and RNA to create a fast-growing virus that can reproduce at a tremendous pace - quickly enough to act within the seven-day tournament period. The mechanism of action is the a rapid depletion of body iron, which triggers a voracious appetite for metal-rich foods. The iron is secreted away in multiple areas of the body until approximately 72 hours after initial infection. At that time, the organism begins accreting iron around itself and moves to areas of heat. Body heat is generated in all of the 701 predators that have been submitted to the tournament since it began, and it's always found in two biological areas - the pump that circulates nutrients and the organ responsible for cognition. In humans, these are the heart and the brain. Our clinical trials have demonstrated this virus is 99.9 lethal after five days. One rare animal lingers through day eight, but after day five even that animal - the Tabithan Balrog, was practically a vegetable. Under the rules, it would have been disqualified by the Tournament.\" Mary's eyes betrayed a smile but her mouth remained neutral. \"What is the route of infection?\" she asked. Mohammed was surprised, and delighted, to hear this question asked. He noticed Kelley didn't mention the route of infection. Mohammed knew it was because the BWG was hoping the Terran delegation to the Intergalactic Tournament would have worked that out, since the BWG was unable to identify a plausible route that would reliably infect the other 13 tournament organisms within 48 hours.

{"original_text": "this was written by an eleven year old I started to realize the mistake they had made a few weeks after I had been taken. earlier on I hadn't figured it out because I was told that my parents were dead, and they wouldn't give me any information about my home, my friends, and all of the things I had wanted to know about. I was watching television when I figured it out. I was watching a show on the news, and the topic was about some kidnapped children. Some had escaped, and some had been found. Then they got to one little girl who escaped and was found. The reporter interviewed her, and she said that she ran away from her kidnappers, who were, they found out, a couple of her neighbors. When she was found she said, \"I know my parents are alive, I know they will come and get me.\" I gasped and sat up. I knew then that the people who took me were not my parents. I was not their little daughter. But why didn't they tell me so? It was then that I began to get angry. They had taken me away from my home, my parents, and my friends. They had done something really terrible, and I was going to get back at them for doing it. I began to cry, and then I realized that they were probably watching me. They were watching me on some sort of screen. I had seen cameras in the corners of every room. I stopped crying. I wouldn't give them the satisfaction of seeing me cry. I would not give them the satisfaction of seeing me get angry. Then the reporter said, \"The neighbors who took the little girl were arrested, and they are being held in a jail cell.\" \"I knew it, I knew it,\" I whispered. I thought of my parents, who might be worried about me. They might be in jail, and they might be wondering where I was, and if I was safe. I began to cry again. I felt hopeless. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know where to go. I didn't know how to get out of there. I went to bed that night knowing that the next day I had to come up with a plan. When I woke up the next day, I got an idea. I looked around my room for anything that would help me escape. But the room was just like the other rooms: no windows, no doors, just the one big room. There was only a bed, a dresser, a desk, and a chair. There were no exits in the room, and no fire escape or anything that could help me get out of the room. There was a television in the room, but it had no cable. I didn't know how I was supposed to get out of there. I went out into the main room, and saw a boy about my age, sitting at a table. He was in the kitchen. He was sitting at the table, and he was eating cereal. \"Hey,\" I said. He looked up. \"My name is Mary,\" I said. \"What's yours?\" \"Hi Mary, I'm Joe. I've been here for about three years,\" he said. \"My parents aren't really my parents. They're people who have me because they want me. You can't get out, Mary. I've tried everything.\" \"Why did they take you?\" I asked. \"I mean, what did they want you for?\" \"I don't know, they never told me,\" he said. \"They never tell me why they took me, or how long I'll be here. I don't even know how old I am. I've been here for three years, but I don't know how old I was when I got here. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.\" \"I think I know,\" I said. \"I think they took me and you for the same reason. They took us because we were special.\" \"Special?\" he asked. He was puzzled, and he was thinking. \"Well, I'm not sure,\" I said. \"But I think it's because we are special. We must be because they took us away from our parents.\" \"But why did they take me if I'm not special?\" he asked. \"Why did they take me if they didn't want me?\" \"I don't know,\" I said. \"Maybe they thought that you were special, but then they changed their minds. I know that I'm special, and I think that you are, too. And I think that they just took you by accident.\" \"By accident?\" he asked.

My eyes met with the stranger's, his were a sky blue and his hair black like oil and slicked back. He wore a rather swanky business suit. His tie was blood red along with his matching handkerchief, protruding out his front jacket pocket. His legs were calmly crossed and he leaned in ever so slightly. \"I said the plane will crash\" he whispered. I could see the neatness of his pencil mustache, probably just recently trimmed. His breath had the distinct odor of peppermint and vodka. \"What?\" I managed to whimper, clearly shaken by what the man had said. He laughed loudly and then louder and louder.

My eyes met with the stranger's, his were a sky blue and his hair black like oil and slicked back. He wore a rather swanky business suit. His tie was blood red along with his matching handkerchief, protruding out his front jacket pocket. His legs were calmly crossed and he leaned in ever so slightly. \"I said the plane will crash\" he whispered. I could see the neatness of his pencil mustache, probably just recently trimmed. His breath had the distinct odor of peppermint and vodka. \"What?\" I managed to whimper, clearly shaken by what the man had said. He laughed loudly and then louder and louder.

{"original_text": "The first months were the most shocking ones, afterwards everything calmed down, albeit slowly. The \"aliens\" as we called them at first were very clearly related to us biologically. At least some of them. Some others were completely different, but we didn't meet many of those for obvious reasons. The first step to building a good relationship was learning and teaching our respective languages, albeit they were quite familiar with our earthly tongues. So our groups were mostly taught Amambwe, Lysano, and Thindlurrinni, three of the most common languages of the newcomers. \"Whatever is the reason they are visiting us?\" Anne asked me. \"We don't know yet,\" I replied. Although I had pondered that for quite too long, I couldn't really come to a conclusion. They weren't threatening, they weren't exchanging information -other than linguistic ones, that is. Their coming was unknown to us, but welcome they were. Not that we didn't have groups of nut-jobs walking around the streets demonstrating. But if they had met the \"aliens\" face to face, they'd feel otherwise. These ones were almost exactly like humans, but they radiated an otherworldiness that can't be put down to words. Was it their scrutinising gaze? The fact that they smiled too much? The fact that they could speak our languages almost perfectly? \"Is everything going alright?\" Ansemi asked me. \"Oh, you startled me!\" I replied. \"Yeah, everything's fine.\" The way these..... people? Sure. The way these people could creep up on you was uncanny. They almost made no sound whatsoever. \"I didn't mean to\" he said in Lyseno. \"It is okay,\" I replied in my broken speech which he didn't mock. \"Lilly,\" he said, \"I wanted to ask you something. \"Only if you let me ask you something in return\" I said. \"You know I'm not allowed. Not yet.\" \"Yeah, I know\" I sighed. \"Sure, ask me.\" I could feel Anne's gaze from across the room. \"Would you like to asswinnento with me?\" \"To what?\" I didn't know that word. \"To go out with me. To have a date.\" I pondered for a second. \"I don't think it would be...\" \"Before you refuse, I have an offer to make. If you come, I'll answer as many questions as I can. It's not much, I know. But it will definitely be more than you already know now.\" His smile was disarming. Three hours later, we were sitting in a small restaurant near my university, with small round tables and cozy colours. Whether the music playing was lounge or some kind of jazz, I couldn't tell. Ansemi was handsome as ever, and his attire was impeccable, if only a bit overdressed. Or was I the one who thought this would be more casual. \"So, Lilly,\" he said and drank a sip of wine, \"I guess you have many questions, but so do I. I hope you don't mind.\" \"Not at all,\" I said, as long as you provide me with enough info. \"Shall I go first?\" I said. He nodded. \"Are humans and your people related?\" \"Yes, indeed. We are very closely related.\" \"Is panspermia correct?\" \"That I do not know, but it might as well be. Now it's my turn. Do you like me?\" \"Oh, blunt. Alright, I can play that game.\" I smiled. \"Well \"Are you ready to order?\" asked the young waitress. \"Beef tartare, smoked cheddar, chestnut,\" Ansemi said. I was about to order a cheeseburger, but with that I changed my mind. \"I'll have the same, thanks.\" \"So,\" sighs Ansemi with a big bright smile. \"Yes. Indeed, I can't deny that you're a good-looking fella,\" I reply, without actually answering his question. But it seems it's enough for him. \"Did you come to destroy us or take us out for expensive dinners?\" I asked. He laughed. \"We didn't come to destroy you, no. We have come to build an alliance between our people and yours. And of course, we'll help you technologically.\" \"But you'll want something in return.\" \"Naturally,\" he said, \"but whether or not you do help us, we'll still help you and our alliance won't change nonetheless.\" \"May I ask what it is that you're after?\" \"This is confidential.\" \"I shall never speak of it.\" \"Our people can not reproduce. We shall ask your people's representatives for reproductive cells. We know you already donate male cells, so I don't think it would be that much of a deal.\" \"I don't think so either,\" I frown, \"but then how did you come into being?\" \"My turn to make a question,\" he smiled. \"Have you ever been married?\" \"Yes. Once. It didn't last. He was a bastard.\" You looked at me quizzically. \"I kid! I mean, I was married, yes. But he wasn't a bastard. It just didn't work out. We were too young and too carrier-driven to even notice that our marriage was falling apart. Until, we did. So we ended it.\" He nodded. His questions were always intimate. Mine were never that. So I changed my tactic. \"Do you have a family back there, on your planet?\" \"No, not really. I have a clan though,\" he said. \"A clan of brothers and sisters. Most of them work as farmers now though.\" \"What do they do there, make crop circles? \" I asked, saying the last word in English, for I didn't think there might be an equivalent. \"Excuse me?\" he asked. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" I said, I didn't mean to offend.\" \"No, I mean. I don't know that word.\" Curious, I wondered. The derivation was obvious, crop circle. His English was exceptional. So, I try to improvise. \"You know, like vistammyne,\" I said, quite literally,'round thing'. \"Vistammyne on field crops.\" For the first time he lost his smile. \"What do you know about those? Where did you get this information?\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked, kinda scared. The waitress comes with our dishes. No one thanked her, despite her politeness. \"I'm not sure what you're asking,\" I said. \"I just made a joke, but I'm sorry if I offended you.\" \"How do you know about vistammyne? Who told you?\" \"No one told me! Crop circles have been a pop culture thing in like forever!\" I reply in English, so that I could make sure none of my words would be interpreted any differently from what I'd intended. \"Are you serious?\" he asked. I take out my iPhone, google \"crop circles\" and show him the picture results. \"I I have to go!\" he replied and left me there. The alien just had a case of Runaway Bride.

As Professor Stone shuffled nervously through the door, he was surprised by the dimness of the room. The only light came from a few small lights that glowed along the walls. What Professor Stone saw, was a dark cave, with water dripping from the ceiling. \"Why does it smell like chlorine in here?\" he asked. \"A safety precaution, Professor,\" said the curly haired man. \"Come on, let's keep moving. I've got a lot of work to do today.\" Professor Stone looked at his curly haired guide, but his eyes were fixed to the floor. \"What is this place?\" he asked. \"This is what we call the liquid room. It's where we do our DNA experiments. The two men walked down a spiral staircase that led to the main floor of the liquid room. \"That's all fine and dandy,\" said Professor Stone, \"but why does this place look like a cave? If you have the technology to grow a human being, why not just do it in a lab?\" The curly haired man smiled, \"That's the beauty of it, Professor. We don't have to do it in a lab. We do it underground. Why? Because our boss likes it that way. He's paranoid that some government spies or something will get to him if he does it in a public place. So he does it in a bunker.

{"original_text": "OASIS - Day 1, April 22nd, 2065 Alright. We all managed to touch down without any actual problems. Doesn't seem to be any damage on the ship. Landing gear is okay. Still got enough fuel to get back to orbit. Sara is complaining about how warm it is. I kinda agree with her. While we seem to be in an oasis right now, surrounding us all is just desert. I mean, we knew it was dry but the clouds were too thick to make anything out. Anyway. We're gon na check the composition of the oasis plants, then get some rest. 42 hour day tomorrow. 30 of it is sun. Day 3, April 24th, 2065 Okay, so the plants in this area seem to be angiosperms, with apparently wind as the preferred transfer method. Makes sense, there's an almost constant breeze. Don't know where it'd go, though, apart from here. Water is fine and safe to drink. Seems to be a spring. We're getting the fusion engine ready, but until then rationed power. Reason why I'm writing, actually. Long time since I have. I remember my dad telling me that once they used to actually write in classes. Heh, good old days. Tomorrow we're gon na go on an expedition, see if we can get anywhere. We're preparing some buggies to travel about. We'll use liquid fuels for now, while electricity gets set up. Day 4, April 25th, 2065 Okay, so me and Mike are heading out. The rest of the crew is going to take care of setting shit up, while we go dune buggying. As Mike's driving, I can write. Outside the oasis, the temperature picks up a hell of a lot, up by 10 to 15 degrees, at least. It's already something like 80 in the shade. Kinda wishing I stayed back now. At least there's no wind to blow sand in my face. Day 5, April 26th, 2065 Okay, so me and Mike are fucking screwed, along with finding the reason why the wind had dropped. Sandstorms. I swear to god, tornados were fucking everywhere. We set up emergency shelter, and we're kinda waiting it out. The sound of the storm has stopped. Not the storm itself, though. The sand's burying us, I think. Day 7, April 28th, 2065 Finally, it's stopped. We checked the plexiglass windows, and we know for a fact we are buried. 10 feet, I think. seems pretty hard packed. Mike's MacGyvering some kind of drill together, so we can get out. I think the shelter's a loss. There's no way we could get it out. Oh well, time to dig. Day 8, April 29th, 2065 We made it. Oh god, I have never wanted to feel the wind on my face and the warmth again. We spent 20 hours, digging straight up. We got to a point where it was actually raining down, but we didn't give a fuck, we just climbed up and up and up, sand in our hair and eyes, looking for the cloudy sky. We got everything out of the tent. The buggy is a loss. Mike's trying to get the GPS unit to work. I think the cloud layer is interfering. We also sent up a flare, so we'll see what happens. Day 10, April 30th, 2065 Nothing. While we didn't want to climb back down to the tent, we had to during night. It's fucking freezing. The tent keeps some warmth, at least. GPS is down, and the flares are out. I think we're just going to have to hike back the way we came. We did lay down Helium Markers, so that's good. Thank god for all this equipment. We're running low on food, though. Got enough for about a week, now. Water's good, we've got 2 weeks of that. We're gon na start walking soon. Day 11, May 1st, 2065 Okay, so we hiked for about 25 hours, thanks to the sunlight (so fucking hot) and we managed to build some kind of sand igloo for the night (so fucking cold). Our water is really dropping quickly, and we are getting tired, fast. Thank god we found the Helium Markers. Though. I've never been happier to see one of those red and blue motherfuckers. We're following them along, and we've past 15 by now. Mike says we've got about 30 more to go. This is really taking a toll on him. I mean, he's a pretty heavy guy. He's an engineer, not Markel Louis, 2060 Gold Medalist Long Distance Runner. I feel sorry for him. I try to keep him on the up, though. I'm gon na get the sleep I can now, and try to cover as much ground as possible. Day 13, May 3rd, 2065 MOTHERFUCKER. One of those fucking'storm-proof' Helium Markers got snapped. We're fucked. We put a 5km distance between each of them, and the one we were going to was in the middle of a fucking crater. We're gon na try to follow our steps out. This really has Mike down. Shit, he ain't doing well at all. I mean, yeah, he's lost like 15 lbs, but he is losing water way to quickly. I estimated, and our water is only gon na last 2 more days. Off we go, I guess. Day 14, May 4th, 2065 We ran out of food today. I didn't realize till I reached into the bag that was already empty. We only have a few more liters of water, as well. We got back to our previous Marker, and we're camping there for tonight. On the bright side, I found some actual life on this planet! A huge, 10ft long snake, just slithering around, with a HUGE bulb. That was dinner. We both ate well, and turned out the bulb was filled with water. We'll be okay. Day 15, May 5th, 2065 Okay, so we walked. We have a general idea of where we're going. We know that the missing Marker in the crater is 5km away from last night's Marker. We know the one far away is about 7km away. Using some triangulation magic, we found where we had to go. Hopefully this works out. I gave Mike a larger ration of water. Hopefully he stays up. Day 16, May 6th, 2065 It's not there. We couldn't find it. Not even a severed rope. Did we go to the wrong place? Was the crater not actually a Marker point at all? The sandstorm changed this place so much. I have no sense of bearing. Mike's not taking it well. We're kinda lost here. I guess we're gon na hike back to our campsite, I guess. Day 17, May 7th, 2065 We can't find it. We can't. I can't. Oh fuck oh fuck. We can't find our camp. It's gone. We know it's the same area. It looks the same, has the same mountain in the distance, but no Marker, no camp, no fucking nothing. We only have a day worth of food left. We have no more water. I need to find one of those snake things again, or we're dead. Day 20, May 20th, 2065 Mike is on his last stand right now. He can't handle the lack of food, lack of shade, lack of water. Neither can I, but he's suffering. I caught another snake, much smaller this time, and gave it to him. He ate it raw. Right then and there. I was disgusted. And hungry. So hungry. Day 25, May 25th, 2065 Mike's dying. I think that snake he ate was poisonous. he's green, throwing up, and not moving. We can't afford to waste this time. But he'll die tonight. I know it. I wonder what I'm going to do. Day 26, May 26th, 2065 Mike died last night. I was so hungry..... Day 27 I have to keep moving. Can't think on what I did. If I keep moving, maybe I'll find the Oasis, right? Yeah, then I can finally lie back in the shade, sip on that bottle of 20-year-old Royale whiskey I smuggled on. That'd be great. Day 30 Sand. It's everywhere. It's everything. Sand, made of silicon, made of protons and neutrons and electrons, which also make me up. By that logic, I'm sand, right? Day It's really warm today. I think I'll take off my suit. Night It's cold. I buried myself in sand. Still cold. Day 35, 4th June, 2065 I see it! It's in the distance. Fucking finally. Running hurts a hell of a lot, despite me feeling lighter. Fuck, I need to take a shower. At least I've got some great thighs from this walking. Ugh, am I tired. I'll dive in that spring, surprise everyone. About 100 yards away now. Let's go. End Everything is sand. I'm sand. The Oasis is sand. There is no Oasis, just sand.

{"original_text": "I looked into the visor of the towering armored figure in front of me. The pure black uniform was in direct contrast to the spotlights shining in front of the stage. I held the microphone in my hand and looked up at the crowded stadium. The loudspeakers projected my voice to thousands of fans. \"Hello, everyone. Thanks for coming out tonight,\" I said, and then I was handed an acoustic guitar. \"I'm going to play some songs for you from my new album. But first I want to welcome you all to a night with me, my band, and the love of my life, my wife, Amber.\" I looked at the seat next to me on the stage. Amber waved. The crowd went wild. I took a deep breath and strummed my guitar. The song, \"I'm Just Sayin'...,\" was written for Amber, and the lyrics said what I felt about her. I'm not the kind of guy to sing about love But when it's the real thing I'm not afraid to shout it from the mountaintops You're the dream I've been waiting for And I'm just saying... I'm in love As the fans sang along, I couldn't help but think about how far I'd come. Amber and I had made so many mistakes, but God's grace had been enough for all of us. When I was a child, God had given me the gift of music and He had never taken it away. It was a miracle that I was standing on the stage of the Amphitheater at Adventure Landing. As I looked out into the crowd of fans, I knew I had been given a second chance. I heard the screams of the fans as I walked off the stage. Amber was in the wings, waiting for me. \"You were amazing, honey,\" she said, and I gave her a kiss. I saw Dylan watching us. I smiled and then looked into her eyes. \"Thank you for everything,\" I said. \"I love you, Jake,\" she said. I walked off the stage and into the arms of my wife. \"Are you ready for the wedding?\" she asked. \"Yes,\" I replied. I looked around at the hundreds of people who had come to the wedding. My parents and my sisters were there, along with dozens of friends. I saw Amber's mother, Adele, walking toward me. \"Hi, Mom,\" I said, and I gave her a hug. \"Hello, Jake,\" she replied. \"You're looking beautiful,\" I said. \"Thank you,\" she replied. \"I just want to thank you for all you've done for Amber and me,\" I said. \"We wouldn't be here today without your love and support.\" \"I'm so proud of you both,\" she said, and she smiled. \"I know your parents must be very proud, too.\" I looked toward my parents. They were talking to Dylan. \"They are,\" I replied. \"I wish I could have had this with Amber's father,\" she said. \"I know, Mom,\" I replied. \"I'm glad you have a new husband now. I know he loves you very much.\" \"Thank you, Jake,\" she said. \"He's a wonderful man. I know God has a purpose for him in my life.\" I looked at Dylan again. She was wearing a white suit and was talking to my parents. \"I'm glad you found each other,\" I said. \"Yes,\" she replied, and then she turned to watch as Amber was walking down the aisle toward me. I smiled. I was going to marry the girl of my dreams. \"It's time,\" she said. I looked at my mother and my sisters. They were all crying, and I smiled. I was the happiest I had ever been. I felt as if I were living in a dream. I was standing at the front of the altar, looking at my bride. I thought about how far we had come, and I felt overwhelmed by the love God had given me. It was the love of my family, and it was the love of my beautiful wife. I said the words I had been longing to say. I promise to love you, to laugh with you, and to make you smile. I promise to keep you safe and to love you with all my heart, for as long as we both shall live. I love you, Amber", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "I stepped on to the stage in front of thousands of fans in a football stadium in my home town of Nashville, Tennessee, and I couldn't help but think about my wife."}

It took weeks, months even, for people to realize and come to terms with what happened. I was young when it happened. Fifteen, hardly at my prime, and there was so much adjustment. Men had been the dominant force in the world, mostly due to the fact that they were stronger and faster. A trait that really only mattered in a more medieval setting, mind you, but old habits died hard. Throughout bouts for equality and calls for reform, women never truly caught up. Thing was, though, that people had a funny way of adjusting to what was new. Our entire lives are spent getting over stuff. War, death, crime and poverty. Movies and TV shows that depict the end of days, and people stop wincing when a couple thousand are cropped off a population of billions. For some reason, people expected this to be any different. It was strange, yes, that men were suddenly the weaker species. Women didn't get any stronger, however. Men universally got weaker. Shred from their physical prowess without so much as a warning, the world took some time to adjust. It wasn't merely about stepping back and allowing women to take the lead. Everything, daily and trivial things no one had thought about before, had to be rethought. Road work, construction, menial labor, mines, war, all of which men had no real superiority in other than their natural given power. And yet, when they were less than a quarter the strength (on average) as women, women couldn't merely pick up the slack. They tried, but these were tasks designed for a strength that just wasn't naturally met. Women, though, were smart. The world changed faster than it ever did with men on top. With all the jokes about how we'd never get anything done once a month, the progress never seemed to slow down. A lot of people expected payback. For men to be treated as lesser, given the \"housewife\" treatment as most reality hosts called it. That was never the case from what I saw. Men were treated the same, if not with a little pity thrown in. Still respected, still thought of as equals by a vast majority of the female race. There were always exceptions, but that was with any rule. Men just had to get use to a world where their strength was a hindrance. I did not. I never felt the transition, though it wasn't just because of my age. In school, I would lift things for our teacher that even she thought was too heavy. At home, Mother and Father had to adjust to my being able to move things about the house at a whim. Of course Mother could do it, but not with the ease that I was able to demonstrate. As I grew older, my strength only increased. As the years passed, and I was an extremely active young man, my natural abilities were increasing exponentially. I worked out every single day I could, while attempting not to demonstrate too much of my strength in school. No one knew, not even my best friends, how strong I truly was. No one could tell just by looking at me either. Men were weaker, but their bodies were still capable of appearing toned and muscular. No, I looked no different than the rest of the men, and yet I was so very different. The history books say that the average man was two and a half times as strong as the average woman.

{"original_text": "Daddy, why's it called Stow? Does it have anything to do with snow? Hah no. Well, Stow isn't the real name. It's actually short for Seed Tower, or at least that's what it was originally supposed to be. It's actually just a few tunnels, and a really big tower. I guess it's kinda like a seed. I live in Seed Tower. It's a nice place, not too big. Well, not small either. There's lots of kids to play with, and I've been in Seed Tower since I was born. I was walking home from school when I saw something on the ground. It was blue, and it looked like a rock. I picked it up and it felt cold. I dropped it. Then I got a closer look at it. It was like a little cactus, but with no spikes. I thought it was beautiful. It kind of reminded me of Mama. I didn't want to forget the little blue rock, so I put it in my pocket. I looked around for a flower, but couldn't find one. I was almost home. I didn't know what to do with the rock. I didn't want to take it to school, but I didn't want to throw it away either. I didn't want to just leave it on the ground, but I didn't have anything else to put it in. Then I saw it. In front of me was a tiny little seed. It was about half the size of my thumb, and it was bright green. I picked it up, and the little blue rock fell out of my pocket. I put the seed in my pocket and the rock back in. It felt strange, but it was so heavy I had to use both hands to keep it from falling out. I didn't really know what to do with the rock, so I just kept it in my pocket. When I got home, I put the seed in the garden. I thought it would grow into a really big plant, but I guess I didn't put it in the right place, because it didn't grow. I got up early the next day. I had to leave early because I had a test. When I got home I was really tired, but I went to the garden anyway. I found the seed, and I thought it had grown. It was still green, but it was just a little bigger. I thought I might have just missed it the day before, so I ran inside to get a ruler. I got back outside and measured the seed. It was about 4 inches long, or 10 centimeters. It was big enough to hold the rock. I took it out of my pocket, and put it in the seed. Then I put it back in my pocket and went to school. I sat in class and drew pictures of the seed in my pocket. When the teacher told me to put my pencil away I was drawing a picture of myself holding the seed. I put my pencil away, but I didn't stop drawing. I just drew the pictures in my head. When I got home that day I couldn't find the seed. I didn't really know where it was, but I thought it was in the garden. It wasn't in the garden. It wasn't in the garage, or my room. I looked all over the house and couldn't find it. It must have been stolen. I was sad, because I didn't know where it was. I was scared because I thought it might have been stolen. I didn't tell Mama or Daddy. I thought they would just think I was stupid. I didn't tell them the next day either. The day after that I went outside to look for it, but it wasn't there. I looked everywhere, but I couldn't find it. I didn't tell Mama or Daddy, because I was scared. The next day I went outside and looked for the seed. I couldn't find it, so I went inside and drew a picture of the seed. I drew a picture of the seed inside the seed. The next day I went outside and looked for the seed.

He's in.\" \"What a let down,\" says the anchorwoman. \"They'll be inside for a few hours. I'm sure we'll hear more about this meeting at some point.\" The camera cuts back to the White House steps, where a Secret Service agent walks out of the building. He is a tall man, with a bald head, dark skin and a very serious look on his face. He hands something to the reporter. \"Here, Pat. I believe you'll want to see this.\" The reporter turns the page over and over in his hands. \"Well,\" he says. \"Well, I'll be damned. Pat, it looks like there was an incident inside the White House. The Prime Minister and the President were attacked by a group of men in the Oval Office.\" The camera cuts to the Presidential limousine. It's speeding down the road.

I'm so sorry,\" he says. \"I did everything I could. It wasn't my fault.\" He starts to cry. \"I'm so sorry.\" The Secret Service agent sitting next to him puts his hand on the President's shoulder. \"Sir,\" he says. \"Please don't worry. We're going to get you back to the White House. We're going to get you back in control of the situation. You're going to be fine.\" The President continues to cry. \"It's my fault,\" he says. \"I never should have let him in.\" The camera cuts to the Israeli Prime Minister. He's sitting in the back of a Secret Service car, smiling. The camera pulls in close to his face. \"Don't believe what you're hearing,\" he says. \"The President was a good man. He will be missed.\" The camera cuts to the White House. A crowd has formed. They are screaming at the police and Secret Service officers. \"Murderers,\" they yell. \"Baby killers. You all killed the President.\" The anchorwoman is looking at her notes. \"Pat, let's go back to the scene in front of the White House. We've been receiving reports that the White House was attacked by members of the radical pro-life movement. Is that true?\" The reporter is nodding. \"That's right. Secret Service agents are confirming that a group of men entered the White House, and killed the President, and the Prime Minister of Israel.\" \"And you say they're members of the pro-life movement?\" The camera cuts to an old, white-haired man. He's standing in front of the White House. \"That's right,\" he says. \"We've been warning for years that the President was an enemy to all life. We've been calling for his impeachment, but he refused to resign. Now, he's been punished for his sins.\" The camera cuts to a young woman, dressed in jeans and a sweater. She is standing next to the old man. \"It's not just the President,\" she says. \"We killed the Prime Minister of Israel. He was also an enemy to life. All of our children must be protected. There can be no exceptions.\" The camera cuts to a group of Secret Service agents, standing together, their guns drawn.

I put everything in it and then started to make my way back to the bedroom. I had the bag over my shoulder and I was going to take everything with me. As I started to walk towards the bedroom, I heard a voice. \"Where are you going, Carl?\" the voice asked. I stood still and listened for the voice. \"Who is there?\" I asked, a bit afraid of what I might find. I slowly walked to the source of the voice. I walked to the stairs and heard it again. \"Carl, is that you?\" the voice asked. I followed the voice and ended up in the upstairs hallway. \"Who is there?\" I asked again. \"I'm here, Carl,\" the voice answered. \"Who are you?\" I asked, afraid of who might answer me. \"It's me, Susan,\" the voice answered. I went to the nearest room and opened the door. I saw her sitting on the bed, looking at me. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked. \"I came back for the rest of my stuff, I just came back to get the rest of my stuff,\" she answered. \"You know that the house is going to be sold, right? You know that you can't stay here, right?\" I asked. \"I don't care about the house, I don't care about the money, I just want my things,\" she answered. \"You can't stay here,\" I repeated. \"I'm going to stay here until I get my things, you know that I will,\" she answered. \"I will call the police if I have to, I will have you kicked out of this house,\" I said. \"You won't do that, because you know that I will win the case,\" she said. \"What do you mean?\" I asked, curious. \"You know that you took some things out of the house when you left. You took them, without my permission. You know that they are mine and I want them back, now,\" she said.

She will do anything to keep me, I'm sure of it,\" I thought to myself. I went back to the kitchen, where I had left the bag that I brought with me. I put everything in it and then started to make my way back to the bedroom. I had the bag over my shoulder and I was going to take everything with me. As I started to walk towards the bedroom, I heard a voice. \"Where are you going, Carl?\" the voice asked. I stood still and listened for the voice. \"Who is there?\" I asked, a bit afraid of what I might find. I slowly walked to the source of the voice. I walked to the stairs and heard it again. \"Carl, is that you?\" the voice asked. I followed the voice and ended up in the upstairs hallway. \"Who is there?\" I asked again. \"I'm here, Carl,\" the voice answered. \"Who are you?\" I asked, afraid of who might answer me. \"It's me, Susan,\" the voice answered. I went to the nearest room and opened the door. I saw her sitting on the bed, looking at me. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked. \"I came back for the rest of my stuff, I just came back to get the rest of my stuff,\" she answered. \"You know that the house is going to be sold, right? You know that you can't stay here, right?\" I asked. \"I don't care about the house, I don't care about the money, I just want my things,\" she answered. \"You can't stay here,\" I repeated. \"I'm going to stay here until I get my things, you know that I will,\" she answered. \"I will call the police if I have to, I will have you kicked out of this house,\" I said. \"You won't do that, because you know that I will win the case,\" she said. \"What do you mean?\" I asked, curious. \"You know that you took some things out of the house when you left. You took them, without my permission. You know that they are mine and I want them back, now,\" she said. I didn't know what to say, she was right, I did take some of her stuff, but I wanted them back. I wanted them back because I loved her. I wanted her to come back to me and she was doing exactly what I expected her to do. She was fighting for her stuff and I knew that she would fight for me if I gave her the chance. \"I will give you the stuff back if you promise that you will come back to me, if you promise that you will never leave me again,\" I said. \"I will give them back if you promise that you will let me go, if you promise that you will leave me alone,\" she said. \"I'm not"}

As usual, a thick fog began creeping into his mind until, slowly, the beginnings of a landscape could be seen through the endless gray. A long and empty road, a lone flickering streetlight; the moon hung full in a clear sky. Like every night for almost as far back as he cared to remember, he visited this road. It didn't lead to anywhere. He could walk for hours and nothing would change. The first time he stumbled upon this weary and dark landscape still stuck in his memory. It was countless years ago, but it wasn't on purpose. He was a much younger and happier man. That night, the air was thicker. A low growl permeated the world around him. The light flickered a few more times before it lost power, plunging the road into darkness. The growl, now more of a roar, seemed to fill his mind until he no longer knew where it was coming from. He started to panic. Could it be? Was it possible that the creature of the nightmares of his youth had returned? Then the whispers began, and cold air drifted down his spine. Terrified, he jolted himself awake, and jumped out of bed. It would be a while before he purposely visited the land of dreams. Immortality is a strange thing.

{"original_text": "\"So..... As you all know...\" Mayor Sharda tapped a few papers against the podium. \"We have a slight problem on our hands.\" She was a short and prime woman with nest of blond curly hair on her head. Her makeup was slightly smudged and she had smears of ash on her clothing. The group of individuals she was addressing was a group of middle school children, huddled together in the broken down remains of their auditorium. Most of the school had fallen in disarray since the first attack, but it was one of the few remaining buildings large enough to host many individuals. \"We're going to do a slight recap of events. Some of you are recent additions to our group, as you have had your twelfth birthdays.\" She gave a signal to her assistant, a unicorn named Charlene, and a projection of a tall but cruel looking man appeared behind her. He had a pointy hat and a long beard marred with gray. \"This is High Emperor Wizard Supreme Tim. He emerged from the magical world three years ago and has set about conquering the human race.\" Some of the girls in the audience did a gasp and turned their heads away. Many of the younger ones bit their lips to fight back the tears as the older ones clenched their fists tightly. All of them had lost friends and family to the Malevolent Tim. At first, the media claimed it was a terrorist group out of Germany. That they spread false propaganda of magic to their cult follows. Then it became an argument that they had advanced technology. By the time the world caught on to their true nature, it was far to late to strike up any sort of efficient counter attack. \"The past few years have been harsh, but we believe that our small town of Elizabeth has the answer.\" The image changed behind Mayor Sharda again, this time revealing an old text writen in archaic script. \"When our town was founded, a famous medicine woman declared that a special chosen child will arise from this place any time a great evil threatened the world. Now, more than ever before, is the point where we need to rely on that prophecy. It is quite possible that someone located here will gain the ability to defeat Tim.\" She stared out at the room and let that sink in. The older children were still averting their gaze while some of the younger ones started to look hopeful, mystified by what the mayor was saying. \"Unfontunetely, we do not know exactly how they are chosen. We have sought out different ways, and every time that particular person has unfortunately failed.\" The last child was a boy named William. They threw some old bones in the air and they pointed to him when they fell. He sought to learn magic himself and mastered some limited spells, but was quickly killed off by one of Tim's poltergeist inhabited tanks. Shield spells don't work well against tank shells. Before that was a girl named Adelaide who was chosen due to being born under an astrological event. She was the Chosen One for less than a week when Tim sent a thirty foot tall assassin bug after her. They said it was a slow death. That her screams were heard in the middle of town for hours. It was supposed to be a warning for them not to try again. But try again they did. And now it was time to select a new child in an attempt to stop the Malevolent Tim. \"So like we have many, many times before. We are going to attempt to find our Chosen One. Charlene here will whisk you out of town safely and we can all go back into hiding and fearing every day for our lives.\" The unicorn gave the children a nod as the woman covered her eyes with one hand. The other stretched out a finger and started to point randomly in front of her. \"Eenie, meenie, mineie, moe. Catch a tiger by the toe...\" The older of the group started to shuffle about. They placed younger children in front of themselves or hide behind each other. Some of the younger ones purposely sought out the finger, still thinking that magic was a game. \"If he follows, let him go.\" There were a few who just gave up completely and laid against the floor. \"Eenie, meenie, mineie...\" Mayor Sharda paused. Her finger pointed at a girl who froze in place. There were beads of sweat forming on her forehead as the mayor's posture stiffened. Suddenly her arm flitted over to the right, before anyone could think to dodge it. Her eyes snapped open and she stared hard at the one who she found. As though she were trying to burn the image of them into her memories. It was a tall boy, around fourteen. Tomorrow, he would turn fifteen and would be no longer eligible for selection. Today, he was still very much fourteen and very much chosen to be a hero. \"Moe!\" The mayor cried out, wagging a finger at him. \"It's you! You are the Chosen One!\" The boy rubbed the back of his head and looked around. Everyone else was staring directly at him but he was doing his best to be unimpressed. \"I think she was talking to you.\" He nudged the much shorter boy in front of him with his elbow. \"Better go on stage and work that out.\" \"No! Not him, you! You Roger Perkins! You!\" Mayor Sharda knew the name of every person here. \"No you get on that unicorn right this instant and go work on your destiny!\" \"Ah, well...\" He stepped back and gave a shrug as the unicorn approached. \"You see, that would be kind of difficult. I'm not a virgin, after all. Can't really go riding on...\" Charlene nudged him in the shoulder as he attempted to side step away from her. \" ..... Fine.\" He tossed his arms in the air. \"Just fine! FINE! I'll go fix things!\" \"Now remember, you have until you turn fifteen to stop Wizard Supreme Tim. After that, you would have failed your mission and humanity will be doomed.\" Mayor Sharda frowned and narrowed her eyes. \"I turn fifteen tomorrow.\" He looked over at the clock on the wall, which he quickly realized was broken. \"That means I only have a few hours to do it?!\" \"Thirteen hours and fourty-seven minutes, precisely.\" The mayor nodded. \"It's your fault for not coming forth as the Chosen One sooner.\" She folded her arms and nodded slowly. \"It should be fine, Wizard Supreme Tim has many spies within Elizabeth. He always comes personally to finish off whatever child we pick near Choosing Day. I'm sure that you'll have till well before midnight to figure out how you are going to beat him!\" Roger was going to issue another word of protest but music had already started to play. A farewell tune to all who have become Chosen. \" ..... Fine!\" He patted the unicorns neck and she stooped down so he could prop himself up on her back. \"I'm going to go out there. I'm going to save humanity and dammit I am going to find a girl while I do it. Just to prove you all wrong!\" Charlene reared back and Roger got a look of panic on his face as he struggled to not get tossed off. \"Good luck!\" The children cried out to him as he headed out of the auditorium with a scowl on his face.

{"original_text": "\"It doesn't hurt.\" I mouth to myself. \"It doesn't hurt.\" But it's not right. I'm light headed, my surroundings swirling around my in a rush of light and color. I can't speak, but I can hear myself screaming as my body becomes engulfed in pain. I'm burning from the inside out. It feels like my skin is blistering and tearing. I'm nauseous, and the thought of breathing makes me want to retch. I can't move. I'm paralyzed and in excruciating pain. Suddenly, the pain is gone. All of it. Gone. I can breathe, I can move, but I can't scream anymore. The room is completely silent. There's no sound, except my breathing. I blink my eyes and try to see, but it's dark. I try to call for help but my voice is silent. \"Hello?\" My voice comes out as a whisper. \"Hello?\" I say again, louder this time. I look down and see that I'm holding my hand. It's white and motionless. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I remember every moment of my life, every detail. I remember every laugh I've had, every tear, and every regret. I know I'm not a bad person, but I'm not good either. I've done things I'm not proud of, and I've done things that I am. I've done things to hurt people, and things to make them happy. I've been so many people, and yet I've stayed the same. I've been on the outside, looking in, and I've been on the inside, looking out. I've been broken, and I've been fixed. I've been angry and I've been happy. I've been me. I've been scared. I've been brave. I've been everything. I've been alive. I feel like I've lost myself, but I'm still me. I've been dead. I don't know what's going to happen next, but I know I'm not alone. I'm not afraid. I'm ready. Just another dream. I open my eyes to the sound of my alarm going off. I shut it off and roll over, closing my eyes and burying my head in my pillow. I'm not sure if I'm ready for this day. I don't know what to expect. I don't even know what to hope for anymore. I think I know what's going to happen, but I don't want to be right. I really don't want to be right. I don't want to be alone anymore. I don't want to be dead. I get out of bed, go to the bathroom, and then change into jeans and a sweater. I stare at myself in the mirror for a few seconds before pulling my hair up into a ponytail. I'm not going to cry today. I walk downstairs to the kitchen and find my dad sitting at the table with a cup of coffee. He glances over at me and smiles. \"Morning, sunshine.\" \"Morning.\" I say. \"Do you want some coffee?\" He asks. I shake my head and walk over to the fridge. I grab a carton of milk and pour myself a glass. I drink it and then rinse the glass out in the sink. \"I'm heading out.\" I tell him. He nods and turns back to his coffee. \"Do you want me to drive you?\" \"I'm fine.\" I say. \"I'll walk.\" I walk back into my room and grab my bag. I feel like I'm going back to school for the first time. I'm so nervous, but I'm not going to let them know that. I walk out the front door and start walking down the road. It's a nice day, but I wish it was colder. I wish it was snowing. I wish it was winter. I want something to distract me. I reach the school in less than five minutes. I take a deep breath and walk through the doors. I walk into the cafeteria and see that it's full. Seth sees me and smiles. \"Hi.\"", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "\"It doesn't hurt,\" I say to myself as I lay on my back in a pool of blood.

{"original_text": "\"Shit, I must have overslept\" I thought as I looked over to my alarm clock as the sunlight filled my room. Displayed on the digital screen were the words \"FUCK YOU.\" \"That's interesting.\" I mumbled as I rolled out of bed. Must have been one of the guys messing with me again. After a quick shower I turned on my electric razor but as soon as I touched it to my cheek, I felt a sharp pain. \"Fuck!\" I yelled as I dropped it. No shaving for me I guess.

Upon reaching my kitchen, I realized something was off. Literally, my refrigerator was off, and it smelled like spoiled leftovers. I decided on toast and peanut butter for breakfast, so I dropped the bread in the toaster and set it to 3.5. Not too burnt, not too soft. As I waited for the toaster to finish, I turned on my computer and shockingly, dickbutt appeared on my screen as Rick Astley's \"Never gon na give you up\" played through the speakers. If this was my friends, they must have gotten somebody else to help, because they suck with computers. Just then the scent of burnt toast reached me so I walked over to investigate.

Jweek had seen this before, and though he had never been an interrogator he knew what to do. The other guard, Tarkin was just a young recruit who had only been with the empire for a month. Jweek hit Chian on the back of his head with his electro-shocker and he slumped to the floor. \"You see, there is no point in interrogating him any longer, he has cracked, let's just take him to the interrogation droid and let him do the rest. \" Tarkin nodded his head in agreement. \"Very well, let's go then.\" The two guards picked Chian up and dragged him out of the cell. \"I can't believe this is happening to me, I have been betrayed by my own kind.\" Said Chian as he was taken to the droid interrogator. \"I am afraid I have some bad news for you Chian, but you are not alone, I am here to help you, and all I ask in return is your loyalty.\" Said Tarkin. \"I am not sure I can trust you, but I have no choice, I guess I am stuck with you.\" Said Chian. \"That's the spirit, we are on the same side after all, and you can trust me.\" Said Tarkin. \"You are right, I have no one else, so where do we go from here?\" Asked Chian. \"We have to get to the Core, and I know a way in. But we will need some help.\" Said Tarkin. \"I don't think I will be much help, but I will do what I can.\" Said Chian. \"That is all I ask, just do what you can.\" Said Tarkin. Tarkin and Chian began to make their way to the Core. Tarkin was sure he would have more questions to answer than he wanted to, but that was just part of the job. The two walked into the interrogation room, they were greeted by a very large mechanical droid. \"Good evening my friends, I am Darth Cruel, how may I help you this evening?\" Asked the droid. \"We would like to interrogate this man, and we would like you to do the job.\" Said Tarkin. \"Very well, I would be more than happy to do the job, so lets get started.\" Said the droid. The droid walked over to Chian and dragged him to the center of the room. \"Very well my friend, lets get started.\" Said the droid. The droid pulled out two wires from his body, and attached them to Chian's head. \"Now, let's get started, what is your name?\" Asked the droid. \"My name is Chian, and I am a Jedi.\" Answered Chian. \"Very good, and where are you from?\" Asked the droid. \"I am from the planet of Mendora, in the Mendora system, on the outskirts of the core worlds.\" Answered Chian. \"Very good, how did you get here?\" Asked the droid. \"I came here in a ship that belonged to my master.\" Said Chian. \"Where is your master now?\" Asked the droid. \"He is dead, he was killed when he was captured.\" Answered Chian. \"I see, and who killed him?\" Asked the droid. \"I did not see, but I can tell you it was a trooper, or a bounty hunter.\" Answered Chian. \"Very well, I think that is enough for now, you have been a great help, and you will be rewarded.\" Said the droid. The droid took the wires off of Chian's head and let him go. \"Now, to get back to your question, you will be rewarded by being able to live a free life, you are now free to go.\" Said the droid. \"Thank you.\" Said Chian.

{"original_text": "It began in the sunlight, The kingdom arose to a new day as they had everyday, afraid of what was to come. I arose from my sleep somewhere in the middle of the night and woke up to the sunlight pouring in through the cracks in the wooden boards that served as a window. It was my second day at the kingdom. I had been walking through the desert for so long it seemed like I was walking for an eternity. As I walked I lost hope of ever finding a safe haven to rest. I had left the city I lived in after a devastating news reached me. The news was that a war was brewing between the kingdom and the empire. I did not want to fight for a reason I did not understand. So I left and began my journey. I walked through the desert with the sun beating down on me mercilessly. I felt like my skin was going to burn at any moment but I kept walking. After a few hours I collapsed under a large tree. I was too weak to move. I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep. The next morning, I found myself in a small hut. It was a small room with a window at one end. There was a small bed and a wooden table in the center. On the table sat a bowl of fruit. I had no idea where I was. I had no memory of who I was or how I got there. I was scared. I was lost in this strange place. I looked around. There was a small window and the room was lit by the morning sun. It was a hot morning. There was a small wooden door to the left of the window. I walked over to it and tried to open it but it was locked. I looked around again. There was a small bowl on the table. It was empty. I picked it up and inspected it. It was a wooden bowl. I placed it back on the table. I could hear voices from outside. I walked over to the window and looked out. There was a small village outside. There was a crowd of people walking along a dirt road. I looked around the room again. There was a small wooden box in one corner of the room. I went over to it and opened it. I found some clothes in it. They looked strange and I could not understand how to wear them. I closed the box and went over to the window again. The crowd outside was getting larger. Suddenly there was a loud explosion and a bright light flashed. I ducked behind the window as the sound of screams and wails came from outside. I looked out again. The crowd had stopped moving and was slowly disappearing. I could see the horizon now. It was a bright sunny day with a blue sky and white clouds. I could feel a breeze blowing in from the window. I breathed a sigh of relief. I was safe. I was glad I had survived. I was glad the war had finally ended. It was getting dark outside and I had no idea how long I had been inside. I sat on the edge of the bed. It was a soft bed. I looked around again. There was a small table with a lamp on it.

He had a gentle voice. He walked over to me and put his hand on my shoulder. He said I was his son and that I had nothing to fear. He told me I was safe now. He led me out of the room.

I arose from my sleep somewhere in the middle of the night and woke up to the sunlight pouring in through the cracks in the wooden boards that served as a window. It was my second day at the kingdom. I had been walking through the desert for so long it seemed like I was walking for an eternity. As I walked I lost hope of ever finding a safe haven to rest. I had left the city I lived in after a devastating news reached me. The news was that a war was brewing between the kingdom and the empire. I did not want to fight for a reason I did not understand. So I left and began my journey. I walked through the desert with the sun beating down on me mercilessly. I felt like my skin was going to burn at any moment but I kept walking.

{"original_text": "Date Received: 4-23-2058 Standard To: Dr. Shepard Duval, Professor of Biology, University of California, Berkely From: NA Subject: Don't be fooled Hello Dr. Duval Who I am doesn't matter, but what I have to say does. I need to talk to you about something very important. I know about your research. I know about the work you did on the whales that washed up on the coast of California a few years ago. I know you have been looking for a reason for their deaths. I know you haven't found the answer yet. You know what killed them? I do. I know who is responsible. I don't care what you do with this information. I just want you to know that there are people out there who are not content to wait until the right technology exists for them to do what they want to do. They will find the answer now. They will use that answer to do some very bad things. If you don't find the answer first, then you will have helped them. I am sorry to say this to you, but it is true. What you do will affect many, many people. Please do the right thing. Goodbye. Sylvia's eyes blinked as she slowly pulled the note out of the scanner. Her hand reached for the glass that was sitting on the table next to her. She ran her index finger along the edge of the glass and then took a sip. She shook her head in annoyance and put the glass down. She was drunk but she knew it wasn't alcohol that had been making her dizzy. She had been drifting in and out of consciousness since the night before. At first she had blamed it on the painkillers she was on for the bullet wound in her shoulder. Now she knew it was because she was so close to finding the answer. Sylvia was a long way from her home in Atlanta. She was in San Francisco, on the other side of the country from where she normally operated. It had taken some time for her to get here, but she was finally on the trail of the last piece of the puzzle. All the information she had been gathering for the last few months had brought her here. A man named Tyler Sharpe had been a student at Berkely and a friend of Dr. Duval's. He had received his doctorate in biology, and had been working as a professor at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana. He had just been hired by a company called Bio-Gen Technologies based in Houston, Texas. The company was hiring and he had been lured by the offer of unlimited resources and the promise of no limits on his research. Sylvia knew that it had to be Bio-Gen that was behind the attacks on the whales. She knew that they were using some kind of a genetic mutation to create the gas that was causing the whales to die. She also knew that they were planning to use this technology for something else, something far more sinister. Sylvia had come to San Francisco to find out what Dr. Sharpe was doing for Bio-Gen. She also had to find out what had happened to him. He had disappeared after a meeting with Dr. Duval in early 2003. He had been late getting to his lab at Bio-Gen and never showed up for his classes at the University of Illinois. They had found his car abandoned outside of Chicago. He had been missing for nearly two years. Sylvia had heard that Dr. Duval had been investigating Sharpe's disappearance and she wanted to know what she had found out. The note she had received from Dr. Duval had been her only link. She needed to talk to Dr. Duval. Sylvia turned her attention to her laptop computer. She needed to check her information on Dr. Duval and the other people she suspected were involved in the mystery of the whales. She logged on to her email account and opened the file that contained the notes she had been compiling. She was so close to knowing what was going on, and she was so close to finding the one person who could help her. She just had to find him before it was too late. Sylvia started to read through the reports of Dr. Duval's research. She was a biologist that had been focusing on the study of the whales. She had been following the story of the mass stranding of the whales up and down the coast of California since it happened. She had been studying them, trying to find out why they had died. She was convinced that there was something in the ocean", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Sylvia's voice broke as she read the letter that she had written to her friend, Dr. Shepard Duval, Professor of Biology, University of California, Berkely"}

Even in the pale torch light of my caverns it seemed to reflect the color of my coins. \"You have in your possession a small token of great esteem for my native lands. To you it is a trivial little ring of brass but to me It is much more valuable. I wish to bargain for it.\" The human said in a confident but respectful tone. Normally when adventurers make their way into my sanctum they come in groups, set traps, and blather on and on about righteousness. It is exceedingly rare to to find one a cut above the rest. \"What makes this ring valuable to yourself more than me?\" I asked with some mild curiosity. \"It is a magical ring that when worn can transform you into what I desire most. You are too large to use such a trinket.\" The human reasoned. \"Interesting...\" I mused. \"What value in such a thing, what could you possibly offer in exchange for a magical ring?\" \"I am not a noble nor royal but anything that you desire that I can produce will be yours.\" The human said sitting crossed legged below my alter. Again its hair struck my eyes, long and golden obviously groomed for many years and kept free of tangles, blades, and briars. \"I desire but one thing. Cut your golden locks and add them to my hold. For the love you have shown them and your vanity being struck would bring me more joy than any amount of gold your paltry life could gather.\" I do admit that being wicked to the race of man is particularly rewarding. They do scurry and war over such trivial things and believe that they are superior to all other creatures. It is a treasure in its own to knock them down a peg or two. The human pulled its hair for a moment, obviously taken back by the strange request. With no more than that moment of hesitation a small silver blade came out and in moments the long golden locks lay lifeless upon my hold. A moment of disappointment filled me. Obviously a magic ring is worth far more than hair but I had hoped for some moments of pain or anguish over loosing something you have taken pride on. \"Very well mortal. If you can find your ring in this massive hold then you can use it.\" I mumbled moving slightly away from the hold. I must admit in my old age I have forgotten where every individual item has settled in my hold. The human took out a small scroll and read from it words that were foreign to me. I heard the rustle of gold coins and a small brass ring with a ruby set upon it levitated out of the horde and into the air. Now was my chance. Quickly I began to transform into the form that I have avoided when possible. A tall slender black haired main with pale skin and long red robes. I snatched the ring out of the air and landed softly before the warrior. \"You can use it once I have taken my turn.\" I cackled. Slipping the ring on I immediately meditated on my own form, scales stronger than ever, breath hotter with teeth and claws sharper and longer than before yet years reset to that of young adulthood. I could feel the rings energy flowing through me and I closed my eyes. I felt my body rippling and strengthening..... stiffening? In horror I opened my eyes to see my body slowly changing into gold, from foot up it climbed. I quickly attempted to pull the ring off but my arms were already growing heavy and stiff. I looked to the human with such rage. \"What is this sorcery! I should have known not to trust a human.\" I sputtered. Already my lungs were stiffening and breath was becoming shallow. \"There was no deception on my part wyrm. It is transforming you into what I want the most. A golden statue of a handsome man will go nicely in my new castle.

I must admit in my old age I have forgotten where every individual item has settled in my hold. The human took out a small scroll and read from it words that were foreign to me. I heard the rustle of gold coins and a small brass ring with a ruby set upon it levitated out of the horde and into the air. Now was my chance. Quickly I began to transform into the form that I have avoided when possible. A tall slender black haired main with pale skin and long red robes. I snatched the ring out of the air and landed softly before the warrior. \"You can use it once I have taken my turn.\" I cackled. Slipping the ring on I immediately meditated on my own form, scales stronger than ever, breath hotter with teeth and claws sharper and longer than before yet years reset to that of young adulthood. I could feel the rings energy flowing through me and I closed my eyes. I felt my body rippling and strengthening..... stiffening? In horror I opened my eyes to see my body slowly changing into gold, from foot up it climbed. I quickly attempted to pull the ring off but my arms were already growing heavy and stiff. I looked to the human with such rage. \"What is this sorcery! I should have known not to trust a human.\" I sputtered. Already my lungs were stiffening and breath was becoming shallow. \"There was no deception on my part wyrm. It is transforming you into what I want the most. A golden statue of a handsome man will go nicely in my new castle. You should pay more attention to grammar and syntax.\" The final moments of a thousand years was to see the face of that dreadful women smiling in the torchlight."}
{"original_text": "\" Captain's log 2449. Approximately two hours ago Communications Officer Ventron discovered a series of deep space com signal coming from a previously unexplored part of the galaxy. Upon further investigation Ventron discovered that the signals were not com signals at all, but rather some type of subspace phenomena. \" It was mid-afternoon when Ventron noticed the strangely familiar wavelengths of energy drifting through the interstellar medium. He reported to the Captain his findings and his suspicions that the signals were some sort of com. \"The com signals are directed at the Nimbus system, Captain.\" \"Take us there Mr. Ventron. Warp 8.\" Half an hour later, the USS Dreadnaught entered the Nimbus system. \"Mr. Ventron, adjust the sensors to scan for the subspace signals.\" \"Yes Sir. Scanning... Captain, the signals are coming from the third planet.\" \"Take us there Mr. Ventron.\" After about ten minutes they were in orbit around the planet, which appeared to be habitable. \"The signals appear to be coming from somewhere in this mountain range. The area is uninhabited, Sir.\" \"I want a shuttlecraft with a team of security personnel and a science officer down there immediately. I'm going with them.\" Soon the shuttlecraft was down on the surface of the planet and the away team was moving through the woods towards the mountains. After about a half hour of climbing, the team finally reached the area where the signals seemed to be originating. \"I'm reading something up here Captain.\" \"Yes Captain. It's a massive complex of buildings. It's huge.\" The team then started walking towards the complex. After a few minutes, they came to an opening in the side of the mountain. The structure appeared to be made out of some type of transparent material. \"This is definitely some sort of complex. It appears to be made of some kind of transparent aluminum.\" \"Yes, and there are subspace sensors and emitters all over the place.\" \"I'm picking up some type of energy pattern. It's a com signal.\" \"Mr. Ventron, try to identify the source of the com signal.\" \"Yes Sir, I have it Sir. It's coming from the second floor of that building over there.\" \"Lets move in and see what we've got here.\" \"Yes Sir. I have a problem, Captain. This area is infested with some sort of aggressive humanoid species.\" \"I'm picking up something in my tricorder. This is some type of biological weapon. It appears to be a nerve agent of some sort.\" \"Lt. Bevin, try to identify the species. Lt. Vargas, scan for the source of the com signals.\" \"Yes Sir. The species appears to be some type of a Klingon. They must be a group of colonists. They seem to be very well armed. Lt. Vargas, I'm picking up the com signal. It appears to be coming from the second floor of that building over there.\" \"Lt. Bevin, I want your security team to clear out the area and make sure that we don't have any more surprises like this. Lt. Vargas, I want you with me.\" \"Yes Sir.\" Captain Mike Jameson and Lt. Vargas then proceeded towards the building where the com signal was originating from. As they walked through the complex, they noticed that it was very obviously some type of military installation. \"This area looks like a starship landing area.\" \"Yes Sir, and I'm picking up a com signal in this building over here.\" As they entered the building they were met by a Klingon security officer. \"Why have you invaded this facility?\" \"I don't believe that we have invaded anything. We are here in peace.\" \"Peace? The humans are sworn enemies of the Klingon Empire.\" \"I am Captain Mike Jameson. I am not your enemy.\" \"Captain Jameson? Is that you?\" \"Yes, who is this?\" \"Captain, I am Commander J'anek. I was sent here to await your arrival.\" \"Commander J'anek? What do you mean, my arrival?\" \"You must come with me. There is much that I must tell you.\" \"Lt. Vargas, you are in charge here until I return.\" \"Yes Sir.\" \"This way Captain.\" Commander J", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "A report from the USS Dreadnaught on the discovery of com signals from a third planet in the galaxy, which turned out to be a subspace phenomenon."}
{"original_text": "He sat motionless in the car, eyes fixed on the house opposite. The house was in darkness, no light save for the pale illumination of the moon bathing the street in an eerie whitewash. The large house sat detached from any other on the street, it's large expanse of verdant garden surrounding it like a moat bordered by a low chain link fence. He glanced at the digital segment display clock embedded in the dash, the numbers glowing an ethereal green, momentarily before returning his gaze to the house. Beds of brightly pigmented flowers lined the pathway to the front door and dotted the lawn, a sea of purples, yellows, and reds. A great silver birch tree dominated the scene, rising nearly as tall as the two storey house's slate tiled roof, it's bark gleaming in the moon's glare, matching the house's whitewashed wood panels in luminance. He grabbed the white cigarette box from the passenger seat, opened it, and plucked a cigarette fluidly, placing it between his lips loosely and throwing the box back onto the seat. A click echoed through the silence of the car as he pushed the cigarette lighter into the socket. Moments later it popped back out, the smell of burnt dust accenting the air. He picked it up and brought the glowing orange coil to the end of the cigarette and lit it. Placing the lighter back in the socket he inhaled deeply on the freshly lit cigarette, the tip glowing a deep red as he did so. Nearly time he thought. The exhalation filled the car with smoke, a thick yellowish haze which made him crack a window to ensure a perfect line of sight on the house. Nothing could go wrong tonight, this was his one shot. The cigarette shortened as the man waited until finally he flicked it from the window, the used butt smouldering on the asphalt. Now was the time, he thought to himself as he stared into his reflection in the mirror, an empty gaze meeting his own. The car door swung open and the man purposefully stepped out. He stood for a moment, hand resting on the door frame, whilst he surveiled the area one last time. Still as the grave. He might've chuckled had the task ahead not been facing him. Striding forward he flung the door behind him shut, the dull thud the only sound in the still night air. It was a cool night, not that it mattered, it had to happen regardless of the weather. A ball of mist hung around his mouth as he exhaled, only to be displaced as he strode forwards, crushing the still-warm cigarette butt beneath his heel as he passed. Stepping up onto the kerb his black dress shoes grated lightly on some loose gravel kicked up no doubt by some passing car. The concrete slabs that lead to the door seemed of the purest white under the bright night sky. Each step brought him closer to the house, his own plan ringing in his ears; kill them, no witnesses. He approached the door and extended his hand towards the unembellished know. His hand hovered an inch away as he weighed up his options. Turning on his heel he stepped down from the porch and headed to the back of house. The back garden was much the same as the front, kept neatly and tended to with much love. A wooden shed stood in the back right corner. He eyed it with curiosity before snapping back to the task at hand. A few cinderblock steps led up to the screen door and he took them silently, unlatching the screen door's length of string from it's makeshift hook and loop configuration. He tried the handle but it yielded no results. Not to be deterred he brought a small cloth roll out of his pocket and laid it out on the top step. An assortment of slim hooked, curved, and straight metal lock picks lined the beige linen. He selected two with a deftness only from years of experience, and put the first into the lock. He tested the pins in the lock gingerly before slotting the tension wrench in, pushing the line again, and twisting. The door swung open, he picked up his tools, pocketed them and went in. It took him a moment to adjust to the absolute darkness inside the house, but before long he could identify a kitchen as the room he was in. A pine table adorned with a red and white checkered water resistant tablecloth stood in the centre of the room. He walked by, running the fingertips of his left middle and ring fingers along the cool surface, focused solely on the doorway ahead of him. Inside the house he could see no doors closed, a godsend for finding his target he thought. Stepping through the doorway he followed the corridor into the main hallway of the house, walking parallel with the steps until he reached their foot where he stopped. Listening closely for a minute he could hear nothing. Could it be that they weren't home? No. No, he'd done far too much research for that to be true. Crouching low he began to ascend the staircase, one step at a time, his shoe making little noise on the strip of carpet running down the middle of the stairs. He stopped at the top. This was it. Finally. Now he just had to carry out his plan like in so many dreams before. He new exactly where to find them. Stepping towards the only closed door he began breathing heavily. He twisted the doorknob and swiftly opened the door, still maintaining silence, though now his movements buzzed with a nervous energy. There, in the otherwise empty double bed, the rapist. Two giant strides and the man was upon his prey. Straddling him on the bed his hands clamped down, crushing his target's windpipe. The shock woke the sleeping man and he began to struggle, hands clawing at his assailant's forearms, torso bucking in an attempt to throw his attacker. Neither man was any larger than average, neither particularly muscular yet the assailant could not be moved, his grim determination set in his eyes, dead in the dim light. As the last ounce of oxygen bled from every cell in the man's body a surge of strength coursed through him, a last ditch attempt to stay on this planet. The two went tumbling off the bed and clattered onto the floor, rolling one on top of the other, each trying to maintain dominance. They traded punches in between grapples, neither willing to relent. The attacker, only slightly larger, used his size to his advantage, sitting on the other man's stomach and swinging wildly at his face. Each hit made a sickening thud and a occasionally even a slight cracking sound. After several minutes of constant abuse the victim lay bloodied and in laboured breaths. The attacker stopped to catch his breath, and in doing so was caught off guard. The man threw his assailant off him and into the wall behind him, stumbling to his feet he threw his entire body weight into a shoulder slam pinning the attacker to the wall by his throat. The drywall cracked behind the attacker and the other man fell backwards onto the bed, keeping himself from falling with a single shaking arm. The attacker stayed slumped back against the wall and coughed, a metallic taste tinged his mouth as he spat and saw blood. The rage boiled within him again. He stepped to the battered form in front of him, it's face barely distinguishable in the dark, though the blood stains on the skin stood out clearly. He reached out a hand, grabbing the man by the collar of his pyjama top, and threw him with all his strength into the ground. He stamped on his skull, again and again, he could feel no more movement but he wouldn't stop until he was sure. From the corner of his eye he saw a waist-high wooden cabinet leaning against the wall. Perfect. He dragged it along the wall to be next to the man on the floor, it's weight deceptive for the size. With the faintest trace of a smile he put all his strength into tipping it. The crunch was sickening and the mess on the floor worse, his victim's head now split and flattened. The dark red blood seeped into the pores of the wood between which the head had been sandwiched. Chunks of everything this man had been squelched underfoot as the killer walked towards the door, the puddles of blood splashing onto his ankles as he walked. As he reached the doorway, head spinning with the delirium of finally killing the rapist he'd planned the death of for so long, his stomach turned to ice and his heart froze. A pair of clear blue eyes looked up at him. Illuminated by a ray of moonlight was the tear-streaked face of a young girl, porcelain skin contrasting long brown hair, reaching down to her pink nightie, teddy bear in hand. The rapist had been a father, he had been a person. So dead set on retribution the man had been he hadn't even considered there being a person behind the villainous cretin.

{"original_text": "\"IF YOU'RE LOOKING LOW PRICES AND QUALITY GUARENTEED, COME INTO FAST-MART TODAY, WE WO N'T DISSAPOINT\" shouted the Yeller as we snickered. My friend Jeffery, a rather talented and well-versed scribe, began asking her various philosophical and scientific questions. \"Ma'am, I must ask, what is the purpose of life and the human race as we know it?\" Jeffery asked. \" ..... IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR LOW PRICES AND QUALITY GUARENTEED, COME INTO FAST-MART TODAY, WE WO N'T DISSAPOINT.\" The poor bastard had no clue what she had gotten herself into. Poor sobs such as this one tended to have come from far away lands, searching for a better life in our newfound \"Land of the Opportune.\" Little did they know that they'd become opportunities, not opportune. After signing an \"employment\" contract, which they could not understand nor negotiate, they would sit down in a small room filled with people very much like them, and begin the conditioning process. I suppose no one told them that the only thing they'd be conditioned for would be a life of slavery. I'm sure the poor sob remembers the painful needle slicing in and out of the skin, spelling out her new baroque and colorful vocabulary of only 16 words. Never again will she utter a \"hello,\" \"I love you,\" or \"Goodbye\"; Those were erased straight off her body during conditioning. Her tongue is now property of Fast-Mart LLC. \"Enough friend, we've had our fun, we mustn't tarry on our way to inscriptionary!\" I shouted at Jeffery as I continued walking down the road towards class. Jeffery caught up to me after about a minute or so, yet he had a look to him; like something was awry. \"What's the matter friend?\" \"It's just that yeller, she noticed something. I'm just..... I...\" \"Yes friend, what was it?\" \"She saw my palm, the left one, where I had my special word inscribed\" \"Yes, and what of it\" \"It was the name of my mother, but not her exact name, a nickname if you will.

IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR LOW PRICES AND QUALITY GUARENTEED, COME INTO FAST-MART TODAY, WE WO N'T DISSAPOINT.\" The poor bastard had no clue what she had gotten herself into. Poor sobs such as this one tended to have come from far away lands, searching for a better life in our newfound \"Land of the Opportune.\" Little did they know that they'd become opportunities, not opportune. After signing an \"employment\" contract, which they could not understand nor negotiate, they would sit down in a small room filled with people very much like them, and begin the conditioning process. I suppose no one told them that the only thing they'd be conditioned for would be a life of slavery. I'm sure the poor sob remembers the painful needle slicing in and out of the skin, spelling out her new baroque and colorful vocabulary of only 16 words. Never again will she utter a \"hello,\" \"I love you,\" or \"Goodbye\"; Those were erased straight off her body during conditioning. Her tongue is now property of Fast-Mart LLC. \"Enough friend, we've had our fun, we mustn't tarry on our way to inscriptionary!\" I shouted at Jeffery as I continued walking down the road towards class. Jeffery caught up to me after about a minute or so, yet he had a look to him; like something was awry. \"What's the matter friend?\" \"It's just that yeller, she noticed something. I'm just..... I...\" \"Yes friend, what was it?\" \"She saw my palm, the left one, where I had my special word inscribed\" \"Yes, and what of it\" \"It was the name of my mother, but not her exact name, a nickname if you will. I called her Mary of the Prairie, but no one had this inscription aside from me and my mother.

That's always fun with a partner or others. They also have a really great dog park there, definitely would recommend \" he smiled. Steve's butt was rocking slightly to and fro. Bill nodded \" Yeah that sounds good. Do you think I could take 2 weeks in a row, say, in September? \" and Steve immediately answered \" Of course! You have been doing the best so far in the team, but don't tell the others \" he winked, but did it so casually that Bill wasn't sure if he was sincere. \" High paw! \" Steve said and raised his hand. Bill, without thinking, booped his hand with Steve's. It was instinctive, so natural that Bill was surprised by the action. \" Haha, good stuff. Well, get back on that call, and keep performing! \" Steve said as he swaggered away. As he left earshot, his colleague Michael leaned over \" Dude, Bill, do you think that Steve is- \" \" A dog? I've been thinking so for a while \" Bill shot back. They looked at each other. \" I don't have anything against dogs, but it would be weird having a dog working with us \" Michael said, licking his paw and putting it to his face. \" Yeah, but I think it's fair. We don't want to be racist, Mike. Besides, I don't think he should hide it. It's pretty obvious that he has been sniffing other people's butts. We have to be more open now \" Bill answered and raised his eyebrows. The poodle sitting to the right of Michael had heard the conversation and frowned. Bill sighed and put his headphones back on. With the emancipation of dogs in the workplace it was still something they had to get used to as felines, but Bill believed in the long run it would benefit everyone.

Bill wasn't paying attention, but just as he started listening again the onslaught of uselessness information made him zone out again. It was a huge meeting and thankfully it was being conducted online, so Bill could zone in and out at his leisure. He began researching where he should go on his next trip. Perhaps out in the mountains. Canada looks amazing, the Rockies. \" Oh wow that looks beautiful \" Steve says behind Bill. Bill jolts and closes the window \" Oh, sorry Steve, I was just- \" \" Oh it's alright Bill! You are doing great this year \" Steve says to him, leaning on his cubicle with his hands behind his back. \" How many holidays you have left? \" Steve continued and Bill turned to him, taking off his headphones. \" I have about 10 days, so I think that could be a solid two weeks out there, ya know \" he pointed towards the screen. Steve nodded \" Yep, yep, good stuff. I was there last year ya know. Great place. So many sights, so many smells. So many things to chase. I loved it \" and Steve smiled. Bill wondered what he meant by \" chase \" but shrugged it off. \" That's cool, are there any places you could suggest?

{"original_text": "On a cold winters night a Large and glistening smile with gigantic wide eyes peer out at the girl in her bed and in a sing-song voice he says: \"Hello little girl, your eyes are glistening, and you're gonna wake up so soon. I'm the one that puts the presents beneath the tree, but if you don't get to sleep, I'm not gonna come this year, little girl.\" The girl in the bed lays there, with her heart a-pounding, and starts to think that she has never seen him, she started to think and the doubts start to sink in. As she lays there and stares at the screen on her phone. She hears a voice, she realizes that it's the man. He whispers in her ear, \"Don't you want me to come to you, my dear?\" and then he softly sang, \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, had a very shiny nose, and if you ever saw it, you would even say it glows. All of the other reindeer, used to laugh and call him names, they never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games.\" Now the little girl with the eyes of glistening cold, she lays there with her hands beneath her head. She starts to smile and then she says, \"Oh, I can hardly wait, I don't think I'll sleep at all tonight. I just thought of something that I really should say, Christmas Eve's a special night, you see.\" \"It's the only time, I get to see, my dearest friend, you, and your big red sack of toys, and I want to thank you for the gift that you give me every year.\" The man in the red suit softly chuckled and said \"I always like to come and give you toys, to the little ones, who are the sweetest girls.\" The girl in the bed with her eyes of glistening, says \"I'm sure that you would know, that I have been a very good girl, all year long, with no mistakes or bad behavior, and I promise, I won't make any noise, so you can come and leave me my toys. And I want to thank you, and wish you a merry Christmas, and I want to thank you, for the gift that you give me every year.\" Then the girl in the bed, she lays there and thinks, about the gifts and the joy that she gets from this man. \"Thank you for the gift that you give me every year.\" she whispers out. As the man's voice starts to disappear, and the little girl's eyes start to disappear. She falls into a deep and peaceful sleep, as the man in the red suit, with the voice of a singing elf, he starts to speak again, \"Sleep well my dear, tomorrow is Christmas day, and I'll see you when you wake.\" The girl in the bed, she wakes up on Christmas morning, and realizes that the man in the red suit, was her Father. And as she lays in her bed, she starts to ponder about the man, she starts to cry, the man in the red suit, was her Father. The Difference Between a Nightmare and a Dream The difference between a nightmare and a dream is that in a dream you can't be awakened. By a nightmare you can't be woken up. And in a dream you can't be stopped, and in a nightmare you can't be saved. You can't wake up in a nightmare. You can't be saved in a dream. And that's the difference between a nightmare and a dream. When I was 7, I asked my Mother where babies come from, and she said \"The stork.\" I said \"You mean like in the movie 'The Babe'?\" and she said \"Yes, just like in the movie 'The Babe'.\" I thought about it for a second, and I said \"What happens if the stork drops the baby?\" She said \"Don't worry honey, the storks are very careful.\" I said \"But what if the stork drops the baby?\" and she said \"It's impossible.\" I said \"Well, what if they did drop the baby?\" and she said \"Don't worry honey, there are people there to catch the baby.\" I said \"Ok.\" and then I went back to playing video games.

{"original_text": "It was a normal day, save for a steady down pour of rain in the hot month of July. I didn't really think anything of it other than a cool summer storm and a nice cup of hot chocolate on my porch. My husband had come home from work early due to him having a killer headache. My mom said it was probably the sudden change in weather; she also had some conspiracy theory about it being the government. My mom is a very interesting person. \"Michelle, do you want more hot chocolate?\" Tyler asked, motioning to the almost emptied cup resting upon my pregnant belly. I was almost 35 weeks, and I wanted to die. \"No I'm good love. How's your head?\" I replied, reaching over to rub the top of his thigh. I listened as the ocean waves lapped against the rocky shore beneath our porch. This was my paradise. If I were lucky, I'd see a whale or dolphin pop up here and there. Today, not so much. Just before Tyler could answer, a bright light flashed up in the sky. \"What the fuck was that? My mom asked from the kitchen window. \"It was lightning mom!\" I yelled back. \"Michelle, that's not lightning. There would be thunder...\" Tyler murmured to me. Out of nowhere, a loud boom sounded. I smiled, getting ready to stick my tongue out. \"I told you, Ty. Light but he was right. A giant octagonal shaped thing came hurling down in the distance. It landed in the ocean and made a significant enough splash, I could see it over the horizon past the tall and rough waves. \"Holy shit!\" I jumped, my cup landed hard on the weather treated porch and smashed into smithereens. \"Get inside, now.\" Tyler stated, getting up to help me to my feet. I waddled into the sliding glass door and he shut and locked it behind us. \"Shut the window ma,\" he instructed my mom. \"Why what's going on?\" My mom started to panic, I could see it in her eyes. \"Is it a nuke?!\" She was on level nine freak out. \"No. Mom, it looked like..... it looked like a ship...\" I explained, my words shaking. \"Like a boat or like a pew pew ship?\" She asked as she did finger-guns and twirled her hand above her greying head. \"The second one. I know this will sound crazy but...\" Tyler trailed off, his face conveying shock. \"But what?!\" I asked, lightly beating on his chest. \"Michelle, look outside..\" My head panned from his face to the sliding glass door, and what I saw astounded me. The water was no longer rough and choppy, but was calm. And still. It was like time was paused. \"This will sound crazy but Porter was talking about this. How they, NASA, contacted Dr. David and said they needed help with identifying some sort of foreign specimen they found on that asteroid that crashed in Reno. It had unknown traces and..... DNA from a killer whale. I laughed it off, thought that it might have been a mistake. But I think that it's right. I think they're stealing our sea life. All those dead fish, whales, everything that have washed up lately on the beach.... It's not because of natural causes. I had to keep this under wraps but this.... This proves it. We had no cause as to why they were all dying because they were all healthy. We named it as natural causes to not solicit any fear but.... This puts two and two together.\" Mom and I were speechless. I felt Ava kick in my stomach and I feared for her life. \"Are they gon na come to us?\" I asked after a few seconds. Tyler shook his head. \"They already would have. They have no interest in us. They want the salt and blood from the sea. They want the meat and bones. The ones that washed up had weird bite marks in their abdomens and were missing their spines. I thought it was weird but that's not really my division. It's Porter's.\" Tyler said as he wrapped his arms around me. \"I fucking knew it. I knew aliens were real.

In fact, most educated folk these days would say his death was the reason everything went so badly down hill, that the warring that had followed was what eventually led to the downfall of the human race.

Humans were on their way out no matter what, or so I've been told. Even so, even if the world was destined to fall apart, his death was still tragic. His death was still a loss to all of us. The world needed a hero, and he was the last of his kind. The world needed a hero, and he was the last of his kind. His death was the death of an era, and not just because he was the last of his kind. He was also the last of a time, an innocent time, a time when things were done for the betterment of society. He was the last of an era that valued honor, and integrity. He was the last of a time when people thought more about their fellow man than they did about their own gain. He was the last of an era that believed in love, and justice. He was the last of a time when heroes walked the earth. He was the last of a time when heroes walked the earth.

My only critique would be to lose the last \"I'm sorry we let you down.\" It doesn't fit the tone of the rest of the piece. Wow, I love this! Great job, Elena!

I run up the stairs, excited. I enter the bedroom and find that my wife is not there. I walk to the bathroom and find the door locked. I open the door slowly.

I run down the stairs to the kitchen and grab a knife. I start to climb up the stairs and see a shadow in front of me. I hold the knife tightly and continue to climb up. As I approach the shadow, I see a small figure. I run towards the figure. It turns to face me, but my wife is not there. I scream and throw the knife across the room. I look towards the mirror, but my reflection is not there. I scream out her name, but all I get is an echo.

{"original_text": "It was a Braun clock: Sleek minimalistic design - mostly just an LCD screen on a black polymer rectangle. Before he had opened the box he had been sure it was his latest order from amazon for novels and action figures, but found it instead. A missent package. He thought. And clearly broken: The clock was telling the wrong time: 1459 hours. No M or AM. Just the minutes, seconds and milliseconds in white digits. When he put the clock away he noticed the type-writer written paper under it. He took it out of the box and read it. \"When this clock hits zero, you will die.\" There was nothing else but that. He stared at the note, feeling blank for a moment. This always happened: No matter how many chain mails he received or comments he saw online saying'If you don't resend thisread this your familyyou will die', he always felt that small fear and dread. There was always that irrational second where he believed it, considered it, but then he would be free of that all. That just never happened. Yes, even if you think ' that will never happen'it's not the sign that it will. Real life had no time for such nonsense. He looked at clock and again, seeing the time. 1458 hours. That was a couple of days. 2 months. In two months he would die, apparently. \"Guess I've better make up for the lost time. \" He said. He had a strange indescribable feeling of deja vu. It sort of felt like the plot to Richard Matheson's'Button, Button. Minus the choice. He had to hand it to them, as far as hoaxes went this one was well thought out. The clock did not look cheap at all. It was such a simple but effective way to screw with somebody, and he knew he'd be playing with the idea in his head even after he threw away and ignored the stuff. Strangely, he never got around to doing it. Life got in his way, or rather the glorious world of the internet did. He had guns to shoot, stuff to watch, parties to attend and regret getting too drunk at. Business as usual. One month down the line he remembered the clock again and looked at the timer. It was definitely broken. It seemed to have gone down more than before. It claimed he had 321 hours remaining to live. \"Huh.\" He said as he took an entire sip of the vodka he had by his computer. He watched as the digital display suddenly paused, and then the number knocked itself down. Now 320. \"What's up with that?\" It was unsettling. On a whim, he took another shot, and just like well - clockwork - the timer decreased again. This time by a few minutes. It took him another week to figure out that the time decreased or increased according to his habits. They were miniscule changes mostly though, and he tried to ignore it all, put the clock in a corner somewhere. He still couldn't get himself to get rid of it though. Frustrated at the claim that he had only 72 hours to live, he tried to open it. And found it was impossible to: Literally. The thing had no screws to be unscrewed, and he knew that something was very wrong when in frustration, he tossed the clock on the floor and nothing happened. It made a loud crack as it went across, but when he picked it up it was completely unscarred. \"What the hell.\" He started jogging. He stopped smoking and drinking and tried to spend his time outside. There was a mixture of dread and relief as his time went up by 200 hours, but then it refused to budge after that. He gave up and spent his days wasted in his apartment, watching the cursed clock and thinking he'd gone mad somehow without noticing. As of May 31st, he was going to apparently die in 23 hours. He couldn't sleep or eat. Every time he convinced himself it was all a joke he took a hammer, a rock or anything to smash the clock and with his failure realized that something abnormal was going on here. He told his friend Trevor as much. \"You seriously expect me to believe this?\" Said Trevor, his friend. He was studying the clock. He wanted to strangle him, \"Do I look like I'm joking? I received this thing back in January. End January, like two months ago. And it's unbreakable. Try it.\" \"Unbreakable, huh.\" Trevor said, walking over to the window and tossing it out. \"What the hell man!\" He rushed to stop him, but was only in time to hear it smack the pavement. His apartment was on the third floor. \"Dude, you clearly need to get out more. \" Trevor said as he kicked an empty pizza box on the floor. \"Plus you stink. This whole room stinks. Get a shower and clean this place up before you make this whole building block a biohazard for godssake. Then, we're going out for some good old socialization.\" \"Dude \"20 minutes.\" Trevor said before taking a seat. So he took a shower. By the time he was done he felt like his head had broken water. It was all so silly, wasn't it? \"Wait. Tomorrow is April 1.\" He realized. The bastards. They had gotten him for sure. Hook line sinker and bait. This would be a great story to write about later. A definite legend to explain over drinks too. It had seriously messed him up. He laughed out loud. \"You ready?\" Trevor said when he was finally done with some rudimentary cleaning of the flat. It had been a pig sty at this point. He needed to sort that out. Maybe even get his life in order. If there was a silver lining to this whole nonsense, was that he could do a better job of taking care of himself. \"Let's go.\" He said. So they went out and had a great time. But the simple great time turned into a party, and he found himself out all night up until midnight. Business as usual. Trevor drove him back and supported him as he stumbled everywhere towards the apartment. He didn't even remember leaving the bar. \"You're the best man! The best!\" He slurred. \"I was seriously in the dumps man. That stupid clock screwed with me in more ways than one.\" Trevor didn't answer him. Was distracted by something. He was looking up at something in silence. \" Hey... \" That was when he smelt the smoke. He looked up and saw that the whole apartment block was on fire. Black smoke roiled out of the windows. There were screams, sirens. He'd been too drunk to even notice. \"I'm..... I'm gon na be...\" He stumbled away and got sick in a nearby gutter. He felt a little bit better. Adrenaline was kicking in to mediate the buzz. That was when he noticed the black shape sitting on the pavement. Looking at it, he recognized it for what it was. It was the clock. Damn thing was even sitting upright. The hours had gone up by a massive amount. He now had decades to live, apparently. One disaster alleviated, it was showing him the next time he was to die. \" ..... Nope.\" He said.

The clock did not look cheap at all. It was such a simple but effective way to screw with somebody, and he knew he'd be playing with the idea in his head even after he threw away and ignored the stuff. Strangely, he never got around to doing it. Life got in his way, or rather the glorious world of the internet did. He had guns to shoot, stuff to watch, parties to attend and regret getting too drunk at. Business as usual. One month down the line he remembered the clock again and looked at the timer. It was definitely broken. It seemed to have gone down more than before. It claimed he had 321 hours remaining to live. \"Huh.\" He said as he took an entire sip of the vodka he had by his computer. He watched as the digital display suddenly paused, and then the number knocked itself down. Now 320. \"What's up with that?\" It was unsettling. On a whim, he took another shot, and just like well - clockwork - the timer decreased again. This time by a few minutes. It took him another week to figure out that the time decreased or increased according to his habits. They were miniscule changes mostly though, and he tried to ignore it all, put the clock in a corner somewhere. He still couldn't get himself to get rid of it though. Frustrated at the claim that he had only 72 hours to live, he tried to open it. And found it was impossible to: Literally. The thing had no screws to be unscrewed, and he knew that something was very wrong when in frustration, he tossed the clock on the floor and nothing happened. It made a loud crack as it went across, but when he picked it up it was completely unscarred. \"What the hell.\" He started jogging. He stopped smoking and drinking and tried to spend his time outside. There was a mixture of dread and relief as his time went up by 200 hours, but then it refused to budge after that. He gave up and spent his days wasted in his apartment, watching the cursed clock and thinking he'd gone mad somehow without noticing. As of May 31st, he was going to apparently die in 23 hours. He couldn't sleep or eat. Every time he convinced himself it was all a joke he took a hammer, a rock or anything to smash the clock and with his failure realized that something abnormal was going on here. He told his friend Trevor as much. \"You seriously expect me to believe this?\" Said Trevor, his friend. He was studying the clock. He wanted to strangle him, \"Do I look like I'm joking? I received this thing back in January. End January, like two months ago. And it's unbreakable. Try it.\" \"Unbreakable, huh.\" Trevor said, walking over to the window and tossing it out. \"What the hell man!\" He rushed to stop him, but was only in time to hear it smack the pavement. His apartment was on the third floor. \"Dude, you clearly need to get out more. \" Trevor said as he kicked an empty pizza box on the floor. \"Plus you stink. This whole room stinks. Get a shower and clean this place up before you make this whole building block a biohazard for godssake. Then, we're going out for some good old socialization.\" \"Dude \"20 minutes.\" Trevor said before taking a seat. So he took a shower. By the time he was done he felt like his head had broken water. It was all so silly, wasn't it? \"Wait. Tomorrow is April 1.\" He realized. The bastards. They had gotten him for sure. Hook line sinker and bait. This would be a great story to write about later. A definite legend to explain over drinks too. It had seriously messed him up. He laughed out loud. \"You ready?\" Trevor said when he was finally done with some rudimentary cleaning of the flat. It had been a pig sty at this point. He needed to sort that out. Maybe even get his life in order. If there was a silver lining to this whole nonsense, was that he could do a better job of taking care of himself. \"Let's go.\" He said. So they went out and had a great time. But the simple great time turned into a party, and he found himself out all night up until midnight. Business as usual. Trevor drove him back and supported him as he stumbled everywhere towards the apartment. He didn't even remember leaving the bar. \"You're the best man! The best!\" He slurred. \"I was seriously in the dumps man. That stupid clock screwed with me in more ways than one.\" Trevor didn't answer him. Was distracted by something. He was looking up at something in silence. \" Hey... \" That was when he smelt the smoke. He looked up and saw that the whole apartment block was on fire. Black smoke roiled out of the windows. There were screams, sirens. He'd been too drunk to even notice. \"I'm..... I'm gon na be...\" He stumbled away and got sick in a nearby gutter. He felt a little bit better. Adrenaline was kicking in to mediate the buzz. That was when he noticed the black shape sitting on the pavement. Looking at it, he recognized it for what it was. It was the clock. Damn thing was even sitting upright. The hours had gone up by a massive amount. He now had decades to live, apparently. One disaster alleviated, it was showing him the next time he was to die. \" ..... Nope.\" He said. And with that, he slid the clock down the same gutter he had puked in, stood up and stumbled away from it."}
{"original_text": "\" Where are we going? \" I asked. The old cab rattled stiffly through the icy Montclair night. \" Shut up, \" said the cabby. \" Shut the fuck up. \" He was a thin, gray-faced man with a small mouth and wild eyes.

Yeah they finally nuked each other.\" Vanessa said. \"Fuck really?\" Jerry asked, pulling himself in zero g towards the \"downward\" facing window. \"Oh...\" \"Well, I think we'll be going to Earth soon enough.

I have to get up early tomorrow. I need to get to work early.\" \"Alright. Night.\" \"Night.\" Jerry shut his eyes and closed the window. Vanessa did the same. She was exhausted. She just wanted to go to sleep. When she woke up the next day, she was still in the same position. She looked around. The window was still shut. She just laid there. She was in no hurry. She just took her time. She didn't even turn on the lights. It was a nice time to relax and think. She eventually got out of bed. She looked out the window. She saw a lot of the stars were gone. She wondered if any of them were actually planets. It was a little depressing to think about. She sighed and went to the bathroom. She took a shower and got dressed. She put on a blue tank top and a pair of black shorts. She walked out into the living room. She saw Jerry was still sleeping. She sighed and grabbed her phone. She pressed a couple buttons and got to the messaging app. She sent a message to a couple friends. She went to get ready for work. When she got to work, it was in a mess. She saw a couple people cleaning up the mess that had been left behind by the other people who had tried to leave the place. She sighed and went to her office. She went to her computer and logged in. She was greeted with the news. She saw that there were some people who were still left in the building. She saw that she would be running the whole thing by herself for the next few weeks until they could get the system back up and running. She sighed and opened up the file system. She made a list of things she would need to do to get everything back up and running. She sighed and got to work. It was a pretty easy job. She could just go through the files and see what needed to be updated. After a few hours she was finally done. She sighed and put her phone down on the desk. She was so exhausted. She was ready to go home and go to sleep. When she got home, Jerry was still sleeping. She got in bed and turned on the television. She flipped through the channels. There were a lot of channels still up and running. She found a channel that was showing her cartoons she watched as a kid. She smiled and watched a few episodes. She eventually fell asleep. When she woke up, Jerry was still asleep. She rolled over and looked at the time. It was 4:30. She sighed and rolled over. She tried to go back to sleep, but she was too tired. She sat up and turned on the lights. She decided to go downstairs and make some coffee. When she got downstairs, she found that she had already made coffee. She frowned. She wondered how long Jerry had been up. She just shrugged and grabbed a mug. She put a bag of tea in it and put it on the coffee maker. She looked around the kitchen. She looked in the pantry. The only thing she could find was ramen noodles. She sighed and pulled them out. She went to the living room and turned on the television. She saw that the news was still up and running. She smiled and turned the volume up. She eventually finished her coffee and went to the kitchen to get another cup. She decided that she would make some ramen noodles for lunch. When she got to the kitchen, she saw that she had more ramen noodles than she thought. She sighed and grabbed a pan. She put the pan on the stove and put some water in it.

{"original_text": "On the morning of the accident I awoke to the smell of charred flesh. Something about the texture of the smell instantly keyed me in to the fact that the smell was coming from me. I can't explain it, but it was a different sort of smell than when you burn your hand or your tongue. It was a more general, all-encompassing smell. I couldn't tell if my skin was singed or if it was something that had happened internally. The pain I felt was vague too. I seemed to feel it everywhere at once. It was hard to pinpoint the exact location of the injury. My body seemed to be in a state of generalized pain. I don't know how long I lay there, in a state of nausea and confusion. I didn't remember going to bed or falling asleep. I felt as though I had been awake. I felt like I had been sitting there on the edge of my bed, and then, I must have blacked out. I could have sworn I was sitting up in bed, and then I fell forward into a sort of daze. My next memory was of waking up and smelling something burning. The burning smell persisted for a while. I sat up in bed and felt the back of my neck. I wasn't burned. I wasn't bleeding either. I felt something wet running down my neck, and reached around to feel. It was a gash. I had no recollection of cutting myself. I grabbed my cell phone and called 911. They told me to put pressure on the gash, and they would send an ambulance right over. I had the presence of mind to put on a robe and tie it tight, so as to not leave a trail of blood through the house. I went to the bathroom and looked at the gash in the mirror. It was quite wide. It went from my jaw line to my hair line. I was just about to press a washcloth to it when I felt a stinging in my gums. I moved my tongue around in my mouth and felt something sharp. I used my forefinger to move it around, and then I ran it under the water and held it up to the light. It was one of my molars. The nerve was still attached to it. I tried to gum the tooth back into place, but it was no use. I looked at myself in the mirror and watched my head moving back and forth, gnawing at the bloody tooth. My lips were so swollen that I looked like a freak. Just then the paramedics arrived. I rushed to open the door. They got me on a stretcher and took me to the hospital. I was in and out of consciousness the whole way there. I remember little snippets of conversation. \"Is he on anything?\" \"Afraid not.\" \"I wonder what he's been up to?\" \"He was supposed to be on call last night.\" \"Yeah, he was supposed to be here.\" The doctor came to look at me. He gave me a thorough examination. He was dressed in green scrubs. His face was covered by a surgical mask. He asked me what had happened. I told him I had no idea. He pressed on my stomach. \"Does this hurt?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" I answered. \"Okay, now this?\" \"This?\" \"Okay, I'm going to give you something for the pain. You're going to be fine.\" \"What about my tooth?\" \"Oh, we'll get to that in a minute.\" \"Is something wrong?\" \"No, no, it's nothing serious. You just need a few stitches.\" \"No, the tooth.\" \"Oh that? I'm not sure. We might have to just pull it. But I'll let you know.\" They gave me something for the pain, and I passed out. When I woke up I was in a hospital bed. There were tubes coming out of my arms and my nose. I tried to pull them out, but they were too tight. I pulled at them anyway. They seemed to be bolted on. I could barely move my arms. I tried to yank my right arm loose, but the tube came out of my nose instead. I looked down at my arm and saw that my veins were now exposed. I tried to stop the bleeding, but it was useless. The blood just spurted out of my arm like a fire hose. I heard the nurse approaching, and tried to get the tube back in", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Ahmed Rashid reflects on the horrific car accident that left him with life-changing injuries."}

{"original_text": "\"Charlotte, have you seen the cat?\" I asked down the hallway. We got the cat last week from a shelter and she's still pretty shy. \"No, did you leave the door open?\" Charlotte asked. I went into the living room and the cat was in there and playing with a little white mouse, like the ones my dad used to play with when he was a kid. The cat didn't even seem to notice me. I walked out and Charlotte was in the kitchen. \"I think I'm going to take a shower,\" I said. \"Would you be a dear and watch the cat?\" \"Oh, okay,\" Charlotte said. I walked into my room and took off my shirt. I went into the bathroom and turned the water on. The water was warm, but not too hot, so I stepped in. I took the soap and washed the suds over my chest and arms. The soap stung a little but I didn't care. I turned the shower off and got out. I didn't know why but I was still feeling a little hot. I was a little dizzy too. I walked out into the bedroom and got a towel. I dried off my back and chest and put the towel around my waist. I walked into my room and noticed something. \"Charlotte, I have a small problem,\" I said. \"My body seems to be shrinking. I'm going to have to go to the doctor. I don't know how this happened. It's too small to be an allergic reaction.\" \"Oh my gosh,\" Charlotte said. \"I have a friend who can help you. She's a witch and she knows about this kind of stuff.\" \"A witch?\" I asked. I heard Charlotte giggle. \"Of course she is. Do you have a better explanation?\" \"I'm not sure,\" I said. \"I'll wait for her. Maybe she'll have an idea of what's going on.\" \"Okay,\" Charlotte said. \"I'll call her up and see if she can come over.\" Charlotte ran down the hall to the living room. I went into the kitchen and looked through the refrigerator. There was nothing I could eat, but my stomach growled anyway. I went to my room and sat down. Charlotte came back and sat down next to me. \"She's on her way,\" Charlotte said. \"She says it's because you didn't say the cat's name.\" I looked at the cat and noticed she was still in the living room. \"I think you're right. I'll go get her and then we can get this problem fixed.\" I went into the living room and picked up the cat. She squirmed but I was able to hold onto her. \"Hey kitty, what's your name?\" I asked. \"Oh my gosh,\" Charlotte said. \"She's shrinking too.\" \"What's your name?\" I asked the cat again. The cat seemed to relax and she opened her mouth. She started talking in a high-pitched voice. \"My name is Cuddles,\" the cat said. \"I'm a little girl, not a cat.\" \"Oh my gosh,\" I said. \"I'm sorry. How did this happen?\" \"I was trying to get your attention,\" Cuddles said. \"I didn't know that you couldn't see me or hear me.\" \"I'm sorry,\" I said. I was starting to feel a little dizzy again. I sat down on the couch. \"What's going on?\" Charlotte asked. \"You look really pale.\" \"I'm not sure,\" Cuddles said. \"I think he's shrinking a little more. It might be because he didn't say my name.\" \"Oh my gosh,\" I said. \"I'm getting smaller.\" \"I'll call the witch,\" Charlotte said. She ran out of the room and I heard her call someone. I leaned back on the couch and took a deep breath. I closed my eyes and the next thing I knew, I woke up in a bed. \"What happened?\" I asked. I looked around and saw that I was in a bedroom. \"Where am I?\" I looked around some more and I noticed I was in a little girl's bedroom. There were dolls and toys all over the place. \"What's going on?\" I asked. \"How did I get here?\" \"You passed out,\" a voice said. \"You were shrinking too fast.

As I think about it, the 10 Commandments could also be called the 10 Commandments of Happiness, or the 10 Commandments of Personal Freedom. And, in the interest of full disclosure, here are the 10 Commandments that I broke: 1. I don't always speak my truth. 2. I don't always tell the truth. 3. I don't always love myself unconditionally. 4. I don't always take care of my body. 5. I don't always practice good boundaries. 6. I don't always respect my own worth. 7. I don't always accept all of my feelings. 8. I don't always believe in my own potential. 9. I don't always know my own needs. 10. I don't always tell my stories. And, not for nothing, but I think that's perfectly OK. Yes, I'm a little late getting around to this, but I've got some news: I'm on the list of speakers for the annual ScienceOnline09 conference! I can't tell you how excited I am about this, I really can't. I'm still pinching myself. I just can't believe that I'll be going to North Carolina to meet all the other cool science bloggers. I'm so excited! I'm going to be giving a talk about blogging, with the title \"I'm Not Talking to You: Blogging for Fun and Profit.\" The title is a bit of a joke (I'm not sure that I'm going to make money off my blog), but it's also a nod to the fact that the purpose of my blog is to talk to myself. It's a bit like keeping a diary, I suppose, and that's something that I've always loved doing. My mother used to write a diary, and I used to read it. I loved the way that my mother described what she was thinking and feeling. I have always felt that there's something incredibly powerful about expressing yourself in writing. I know that not everyone feels that way, but I certainly do. And that is why I'm so very excited about the ScienceOnline09 conference. I'm so excited about meeting all the other bloggers. I'm excited about learning from them, and about sharing my own experiences. I've had some wonderful experiences since I started blogging. I've met so many amazing people. I've been to science events that I never would have attended before, and I've gone places that I wouldn't have gone. I've had the chance to talk to some of my favorite scientists.

{"original_text": "This is becoming pretty long! - I live in the City of Northern Light. It's about twice the size of Little Cleveland, half the size of Lex, and a small dot compared to New Atlantis. In school they told us it's supposed to be one of the oldest cities in the country. It's the oldest I know of. It has a over a million people, 50 schools and universities combined, 14 Halo department stores, and a lot more. Best of all though, it has an abandoned school from over 100 years ago that me and my buddies sneak into every Saturday. Nobody knows it, but the sewer that runs through the town and under Aurora Park has a connection to it. We sneak in through a manhole in the park and leave whenever we want. The school is called Alexandra's School of Engineering and it used to be some sort of hub of technology before the world around us was built. I can't imagine what things would have been like before Northern Light existed, but I imagine it was not very interesting and maybe it was dark without the city's lights. Usually my buddy Julius and I spent an hour hoverboarding up and down the old engineering hill where all of the graduate students built their models. Its like a monument and it's better than any terrain park I've ever seen outside, back in Northern Light. The school itself was like a giant domed colosseum of buildings. There were a few lights up on top that were still on, giving the place the feel of about 8 PM in Northern Light, the time when they dim the city lights. Somedays our group goes exploring instead. We often don't venture too far into anywhere since there aren't very many functional lights left and it can get a little spooky. On Halloween of this year our friend Casey was turning 15 and he told us he would go deeper into the school than we'd ever been. He wasn't going to be afraid anymore. He had a perfect setup too. There was a cam on his helmet for streaming to us, thanks to the signal boosters he would drop along the way. He had a Neverdie light built for tunneling companies (a light supposedly so efficient that as long as you are moving some every hour, will never die). He would ride his hoverboard along, going through every hallway he could find and if he ever got lost he had his VR goggles set up to guide him back along the trail of virtual breadcrumbs. The whole thing was perfect. We were finally going to get to see the parts of the school we were too afraid to go to before. Well that was the plan anyways. Unfortunately, fearless Mikey K. joined us that day and he rarely let anyone get the better of him. He had already talked about joining Casey, and then Julius went ahead and dared him to ride along. So Mikey went too with no more than the usual gear we carry, which is just a phone (a phone which doesn't even get reception in the depths of the school without signal boosters). Five minutes into their endeavor Casey had already ditched Mikey and was exploring everything we always wanted to see. We mostly forgot about Mikey since we couldn't take our eye off of the stream, but every once in a while one of us got a bad feeling and asked, \" Do you think Mikey's okay? \" Nobody ever responded and we just kept watching. After two hours, Casey was back out in front of the school and we couldn't stop talking about all of the things we'd seen. He'd found tons of old tech for us to play with and even an old mechanical laptop with its ancient charging cable. After the initial excitement died down a bit Casey looked around for Mikey. \" Where's Mikey at, guys? \" he asked. \" I figured he'd run back out right away after I ditched him. \" \" He never came out. \" Julius said. \" I don't think anybody knows what to do. \" \" Shit, guys! \" he yelled. \" Are you kidding? What are you doing, we have to find him! \" \" Yeah, \" I said, \" but we don't have all the gear. You're the only one prepared enough to go. \" \" Are you kidding me? We'll just go in pairs, we aren't leaving Mikey in there. God, sounds like you guys already gave up on him. \" And that was the last of that conversation. We paired up and trekked inside. I went with Julius, Casey went with his little brother, and our other buddies Pete and Suds paired up as well. Unfortunately, there wasn't any good way for us to stay connected. Each group took two of Casey's boosters, but if we really split up it would be hard to get very far and keep connected. After half an hour of searching with Julius he told me he had to take a whiz. We'd been to several rooms Casey hadn't and had a wing left that nobody had been too before. We also didn't end up having any connection to any of the others. The plan was to meet back out front after an hour just in case. The part of the school we were in was the structure that contained the buildings for most of the classes and offices. There were various creepy courtyards full of mostly decayed plants, locker rooms, and gyms with equipment that must have been for keeping fit. Thanks to modern science, most of our gyms are just for practicing sports since working out became an antiquated, obsolete way of staying healthy. All in all, it was quite the interesting place for a bunch of teenage guys to explore. Well, while Julius was taking a piss I went off for a bit just to look around and found an old courtyard similar to the others. I told him I'd be right back, and fully intended to be.

It's about twice the size of Little Cleveland, half the size of Lex, and a small dot compared to New Atlantis. In school they told us it's supposed to be one of the oldest cities in the country. It's the oldest I know of. It has a over a million people, 50 schools and universities combined, 14 Halo department stores, and a lot more. Best of all though, it has an abandoned school from over 100 years ago that me and my buddies sneak into every Saturday. Nobody knows it, but the sewer that runs through the town and under Aurora Park has a connection to it. We sneak in through a manhole in the park and leave whenever we want. The school is called Alexandra's School of Engineering and it used to be some sort of hub of technology before the world around us was built. I can't imagine what things would have been like before Northern Light existed, but I imagine it was not very interesting and maybe it was dark without the city's lights. Usually my buddy Julius and I spent an hour hoverboarding up and down the old engineering hill where all of the graduate students built their models. Its like a monument and it's better than any terrain park I've ever seen outside, back in Northern Light. The school itself was like a giant domed colosseum of buildings. There were a few lights up on top that were still on, giving the place the feel of about 8 PM in Northern Light, the time when they dim the city lights. Somedays our group goes exploring instead. We often don't venture too far into anywhere since there aren't very many functional lights left and it can get a little spooky. On Halloween of this year our friend Casey was turning 15 and he told us he would go deeper into the school than we'd ever been. He wasn't going to be afraid anymore. He had a perfect setup too. There was a cam on his helmet for streaming to us, thanks to the signal boosters he would drop along the way. He had a Neverdie light built for tunneling companies (a light supposedly so efficient that as long as you are moving some every hour, will never die). He would ride his hoverboard along, going through every hallway he could find and if he ever got lost he had his VR goggles set up to guide him back along the trail of virtual breadcrumbs. The whole thing was perfect. We were finally going to get to see the parts of the school we were too afraid to go to before. Well that was the plan anyways. Unfortunately, fearless Mikey K. joined us that day and he rarely let anyone get the better of him. He had already talked about joining Casey, and then Julius went ahead and dared him to ride along. So Mikey went too with no more than the usual gear we carry, which is just a phone (a phone which doesn't even get reception in the depths of the school without signal boosters). Five minutes into their endeavor Casey had already ditched Mikey and was exploring everything we always wanted to see. We mostly forgot about Mikey since we couldn't take our eye off of the stream, but every once in a while one of us got a bad feeling and asked, \" Do you think Mikey's okay? \" Nobody ever responded and we just kept watching. After two hours, Casey was back out in front of the school and we couldn't stop talking about all of the things we'd seen. He'd found tons of old tech for us to play with and even an old mechanical laptop with its ancient charging cable. After the initial excitement died down a bit Casey looked around for Mikey. \" Where's Mikey at, guys? \" he asked. \" I figured he'd run back out right away after I ditched him. \" \" He never came out. \" Julius said. \" I don't think anybody knows what to do. \" \" Shit, guys! \" he yelled. \" Are you kidding? What are you doing, we have to find him! \" \" Yeah, \" I said, \" but we don't have all the gear. You're the only one prepared enough to go. \" \" Are you kidding me? We'll just go in pairs, we aren't leaving Mikey in there. God, sounds like you guys already gave up on him. \" And that was the last of that conversation. We paired up and trekked inside. I went with Julius, Casey went with his little brother, and our other buddies Pete and Suds paired up as well. Unfortunately, there wasn't any good way for us to stay connected. Each group took two of Casey's boosters, but if we really split up it would be hard to get very far and keep connected. After half an hour of searching with Julius he told me he had to take a whiz. We'd been to several rooms Casey hadn't and had a wing left that nobody had been too before. We also didn't end up having any connection to any of the others. The plan was to meet back out front after an hour just in case. The part of the school we were in was the structure that contained the buildings for most of the classes and offices. There were various creepy courtyards full of mostly decayed plants, locker rooms, and gyms with equipment that must have been for keeping fit. Thanks to modern science, most of our gyms are just for practicing sports since working out became an antiquated, obsolete way of staying healthy. All in all, it was quite the interesting place for a bunch of teenage guys to explore. Well, while Julius was taking a piss I went off for a bit just to look around and found an old courtyard similar to the others. I told him I'd be right back, and fully intended to be. I went inside and saw the same dead plants with their withered leaves, untouched by time. After a moment, I saw a hole in the ground by an old dead tree.

{"original_text": "For the longest time the rumours coming out of Siberia had been of the apocalyptic variety. Secret bases doing this, quarantines hiding that, civilians disappearing because they had seen those. Misinformation had been circulating ever since the end if the war.

The higher ups trusted him with enough information to do his job but not enough to ever fully know what he was doing. He liked it this way because it made his job a lot easier. Ostensibly it was in case he ever defected or the bureau was ever infiltrated. They could get some information but not a lot - the foreigners thought of communism as'sharing.' Vadim knew how wrong they were. At least here, in his grey office with his grey computer screen and his regulation black pen. Ten minutes to the hour Vadim took a notebook from his top drawer and flicked to the lost recent page. Every one prior to today's had been seen by his superior at the end of working hours and redacted accordingly. All of the lines had once contained Vadim's precise handwriting - now they just held intriguing black bars. He turned the radio dial to the preset channel. Someone else was in charge of the frequency, he just had thirty six dial positions, and thirty five of then broadcast nothing but static. With five minutes to go Vadim adjusted his headset and waited. The first few hundred times Vadim had felt tension at this point. What would the message be? Who was the person broadcasting everything? What was he a part of anyway? \"Situation normal.\" And then static again. Vadim took his pen and recorded the message for the sixth time today. Six messages and three to go.

A large filing cabinet took up an entire wall of his office. In it you would find the entire history of post war Siberia in newspaper articles, photographs and departmental memos. It was Vadim's second job. He reached over and took the first newspaper and began to read. It was mostly small town stuff but here and there he found mentions of foreign affairs. How the capitalists weren't doing so good. How Russia would prevail. A KV tank had been found in ruins. Those things were still turning up almost thirty years later.

It was the only thing they didn't censor. When he left this job - died - it would be the only thing besides the black bars that proved he was here. And that was when he saw it.

Vadim's job was to sit in a room for nine and a half hours a day, taking down radio messages and searching for this town's name. Five minutes.

He read and reread until he knew the three paragraphs backwards and forwards. He mouthed along with it. When the reporter wrote it she had no idea that the town she had been visiting - a standard, Siberian wasteland town with thirty people living there - simply did not exist. As Vadim read the piece days later in Moscow he shared her ignorance. To him that name could have been anything until he saw the familiar collection of letters.

{"original_text": "The sound of the feathered pen, dipped hastily in ink, carving the heavy-handed signature of crowned prince into the gilded scroll echoed along the length of the great wooden table. The hall had fallen silent as the nobles of the empire had watched with bated breath as their future emperor had penned his name to the document. Once he had finished, the hall erupted in a roar of approval and shouts of joy. The crowned prince smiled, raising his hand to bid his court to silence. In a moment, the hall fell silent once more, as everyone waited to hear the first words of their new emperor. \"My father,\" the prince began, clearing his throat as he looked down at the page. \"I thank you for your wisdom, and your dedication to our people. I have studied under your guidance, and I wish to do nothing but serve our people.\" \"I am glad to hear that,\" the old emperor replied, his voice booming across the hall. \"I wish that you had inherited my wisdom, but I am content that you have inherited my bravery and my dedication. For that I am proud, my son. I have seen great things in you, and I look forward to seeing what you will do for this kingdom.\" The prince nodded in agreement. \"I thank you, father. Your support is all I need to lead our people forward.\" \"So long as you never forget your people, my son, I will forever be proud of you.\" \"You need not worry, father. I will never forget you, or our people. I will lead our kingdom with the same pride you have shown over the years.\" The hall erupted in cheers, and the prince smiled, taking a moment to enjoy the support of his people. As the hall slowly began to quiet, the prince stood. \"Father, if you would do me the honor of standing with me, I would like to make the first decree of my reign.\" The old emperor stood with a heavy sigh. \"As you wish, my son.\" The prince stepped forward, walking to the head of the table. He leaned against the table, his hands on the edge. The nobles in the hall stood as one, silently awaiting the prince's decree. The prince took a deep breath, preparing himself. \"I, Prince Mathias, now Emperor Mathias, declare that we shall begin our campaign of war against the kingdom of Tern, in order to ensure the safety of our people and our kingdom.\" The hall fell into silence. \"What?\" The old emperor shouted. \"What do you mean?\" \"My father, it is time to move. We cannot afford to let our enemies grow stronger. If we delay, we will be overrun. It is not too late, but soon, if we do not act now, it will be. I will do this for you, and for our people.\" \"You will do nothing of the sort! You are not a soldier! You have never known war, you have never known battle! How dare you speak of such things!\" \"I have studied under your guidance, father,\" the prince replied. \"I have spent my life learning to lead our kingdom. I have learned the ways of war, father. I know what I am doing.\" \"You know nothing!\" The old emperor shouted. \"This is madness! You will doom our kingdom to death and ruin!\" The prince sighed. \"Father, please. I know that this is difficult. I have felt the same way, but the kingdom must move forward.\" \"You will not move the kingdom forward! You will kill it!\" \"Father!\" The prince shouted, slamming his hands on the table. \"I will not stand for this! You have led our kingdom through war and peace. You have made us what we are. But now it is time to pass on the crown. I will lead this kingdom through the trials ahead.\" \"I will not let you.\" The prince stood up, turning to face his father. \"You have given me no choice, father. You have left me no other option.\" The prince shouted, turning to the nobles of the court. \"Kill him!\" The nobles of the court drew their blades, stepping forward as one. \"My son,\" the old emperor said, taking a step back. \"What are you doing?\" \"I am doing what you should have done, father,\" the prince replied, raising his hand. \"Kill him.\" The nobles of the court rushed forward, surrounding the old emperor.

{"original_text": "\"Under the aegis of our gods we took to the stars. Under the guidance of the Pearl of Dawn we ranged out and met other species. With the kindness of the Keeper of Hearths we brought them to our fold. Behind the protection of the Sorrowful Matron we defeated their attacks. Under the gaze of the Shrouded Captain we accepted their gods alongside ours. And now, following the light of the Soothing Torch, we will bring glory to our empire.\" It was a common prayer, and Alit spent a few moments meditating on its meaning before getting to his feet and walking out of the Chapel. It was about giving praise to the gods, of course, but not only. It was about trust. The gods had always stood by the Hiloi, from the founding of the First Empire, through the First and Second Interregnums and the Second Empire of today. The prayer was about reaffirming the Hiloi's commitment to the covenant between them and their gods, and most importantly trust that as long as that covenant held, nothing could shake the Empire. Alit made his way to the Emperor Hijraska's bridge, pausing only briefly when he came across the ship's Chaplain to kiss his ceremonial ring. He'd barely taken his station as the bridge's nav officer that Crusader Settn, the Hijraska's XO, appeared, prompting the officers on the bridge to murmur a Psalm of Benediction as naval tradition mandated. Settn's face was grim and his second pair of ears flat against the top of his head - a sure sign of the worry that ate him inside. He gestured to Alit first, then to Densk and L'citar, the ship's com and tactical officer respectively. \"Officers, please, come with us. The Captain has requested all Bishop officers to join him for a briefing immediately.\" That was out of the ordinary, so Alit jumped on his feet and almost rushed towards the briefing room. Densk was right behind him, but L'citar was a Byrhilf - a proud client race of the Hiloi - and noticeably slower, so he took more time to join them. Luckily, he was the only non-Hiloi officer on the ship, so everyone else was present and accounted for by the time he arrived, and the Captain started. Captain Iltess was a man of few words, as befitted one born under the sign of the Sorrowful Matron. The Goddess of Victory gave her favorites a keen tactical mind, bravery and leadership, but no interest in making long-winded speeches. That belonged more to the Shrouded Captain's priestts and the Soothing Torch's politicians. Hence, it was no surprise to Alit that the Captain immediately laid out the problem. \"We have received a transmission from Planet DX-2552 Threshold of Redemption, local name Earth. It's not unusual for us, we've received low-intensity waves, echoes of local communications, during our surveys of the sector before. In fact, they even sent out deliberate attempts to contact other races before. But this time it's different.\" Densk shook his whiskers in an interrogative gesture. \"Threshold of Redemption? Isn't that the quarantined Class 3 planet with a sub-FTL civilization? The Heymans?\" \"Humans, actually,\" answered Captain Iltess. \"And they're not sub-FTL. Not anymore. Look:\" As he said these words, the Captain activated the briefing display. A human face sprang up between them all - Alit noted, with mild amusement, that Humans looked almost exactly like two-eyed Ine'l. The small patch of hair on the top of its head was the color of the morning sun, and the rest of its face was pale and hairless, with very pale blue eyes and round pupils. When it started speaking, its high-pitched voice was overlaid with a synthetised translation in Hiloira. \" This is Captain Lyudmila Dimitryevna Karpov, of the UNS Lighthouse. We're broadcasting this on all frequencies to let anyone in the vicinity know that we've just completed our very first hyperjump, or FTL jump, or whatever it is you people call it. There are more of my people preparing more ships, and we're going to meet very soon. I hope this message serves as a sample to work on interpreting our language, that'll be useful for our first meeting. I don't know what kind of galactic community there is out there, but we're excited to meet you all! \" The natural voice under the synthetizer seemed sincere, almost eager. Alit couldn't understand the Captain and XO's reluctance. \"This is good news,\" he ventured. \"Now we can start negotiating with them to integrate them into the Empire, and bring their gods into our fol Before he could finish, Crusader Settn flattened his ears and almost bared his fangs at him, a reprimand so strong that it would usually be reserved for criminal misbehavior or negligence. Stunned, Alit was left wondering what had prompted that outburst. The Captain raised a calming hand and went on. \"While it would generally be a good thing, the Emperor and the Cardinals have determined that Earth is to remain quarantined indefinitely. You see, the Humans have exhibited throughout history a peculiar taste for making war.\" \"That's not exactly unusual, sir...\" Densk dared. And it wasn't. A lot of civilizations encountered by the Hiloi had martial cultures. The Byrhilf had lived in warring clans, the system-spanning Dieppal had established clashing planetary kingdoms, and the avian K'K'kt'K has settled all their bloodline disputes in all-out aerial combat between the males of each involved family. The Hiloi themselves did not relish war, but they knew of it. \"I mean, Captain, our own Sorrowful Matron taught us the ways of war...\" \"Perhaps, but the Sorrowful Matron teaches to strike quickly, cleanly and with resolve at the most valuable objectives. She never taught us savagery and destruction. Take a look at what information we have of their gods - artwork, video and other recovered media...\" More images sprang up from the display. A painting of a city, destroyed by a rain of fire as hapless survivors cowered before the divine. A man, naked but for a loincloth, twisting with pain on a wooden cross as blood dripped down to be collected in a cup, his face raised to the sky in silent prayer. A many-armed being, blue-skinned and dancing on a dead body, holding an assortment of weapons and battle trophies. A priest in a feathered robe plucking out the heart of a bound victim as a sacrifice atop a blood-caked pyramid. Another questioning a screaming, broken victim of torture before leading him to a woodpile and setting it alight. And yet another ululating religious cries in apparent ecstasy as he sliced through the throat of a helpless captive in a desert. The images went on and on until Alit felt sick to his stomach..... And he barely noticed when the Captain started speaking again. \"They worship gods of savagery and bloodthirst, who teach pain and destruction to those who would serve them.

There is no solution other than total war.\"", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "\"Under the aegis of our gods we took to the stars. Under the guidance of the Pearl of Dawn we ranged out and met other species. With the kindness of the Keeper of Hearths we brought them to our fold. Behind the protection of the Sorrowful Matron we defeated their attacks. Under the gaze of the Shrouded Captain we accepted their gods alongside ours. And now, following the light of the Soothing Torch, we will bring glory to our empire.\" It was a common prayer, and Alit spent a few moments meditating on its meaning before getting to his feet and walking out of the Chapel. It was about giving praise to the gods, of course, but not only. It was about trust. The gods had always stood by the Hiloi, from the founding of the First Empire, through the First and Second Interregnums and the Second Empire of today. The prayer was about reaffirming the Hiloi's commitment to the covenant between them and their gods, and most importantly trust that as long as that covenant held, nothing could shake the Empire. Alit made his way to the Emperor Hijraska's bridge, pausing only briefly when he came across the ship's Chaplain to kiss his ceremonial ring. He'd barely taken his station as the bridge's nav officer that Crusader Settn, the Hijraska's XO, appeared, prompting the officers on the bridge to murmur a Psalm of Benediction as naval tradition mandated. Settn's face was grim and his second pair of ears flat against the top of his head - a sure sign of the worry that ate him inside. He gestured to Alit first, then to Densk and L'citar, the ship's com and tactical officer respectively. \"Officers, please, come with us. The Captain has requested all Bishop officers to join him for a briefing immediately.\" That was out of the ordinary, so Alit jumped on his feet and almost rushed towards the briefing room. Densk was right behind him, but L'citar was a Byrhilf - a proud client race of the Hiloi - and noticeably slower, so he took more time to join them. Luckily, he was the only non-Hiloi officer on the ship, so everyone else was present and accounted for by the time he arrived, and the Captain started. Captain Iltess was a man of few words, as befitted one born under the sign of the Sorrowful Matron. The Goddess of Victory gave her favorites a keen tactical mind, bravery and leadership, but no interest in making long-winded speeches. That belonged more to the Shrouded Captain's priestts and the Soothing Torch's politicians. Hence, it was no surprise to Alit that the Captain immediately laid out the problem. \"We have received a transmission from Planet DX-2552 Threshold of Redemption, local name Earth. It's not unusual for us, we've received low-intensity waves, echoes of local communications, during our surveys of the sector before. In fact, they even sent out deliberate attempts to contact other races before. But this time it's different.\" Densk shook his whiskers in an interrogative gesture. \"Threshold of Redemption? Isn't that the quarantined Class 3 planet with a sub-FTL civilization? The Heymans?\" \"Humans, actually,\" answered Captain Iltess. \"And they're not sub-FTL. Not anymore. Look:\" As he said these words, the Captain activated the briefing display. A human face sprang up between them all - Alit noted, with mild amusement, that Humans looked almost exactly like two-eyed Ine'l. The small patch of hair on the top of its head was the color of the morning sun, and the rest of its face was pale and hairless, with very pale blue eyes and round pupils. When it started speaking, its high-pitched voice was overlaid with a synthetised translation in Hiloira. \" This is Captain Lyudmila Dimitryevna Karpov, of the UNS Lighthouse. We're broadcasting this on all frequencies to let anyone in the vicinity know that we've just completed our very first hyperjump, or FTL jump, or whatever it is you people call it. There are more of my people preparing more ships, and we're going to meet very soon. I hope this message serves as a sample to work on interpreting our language, that'll be useful for our first meeting. I don't know what kind of galactic community there is out there, but we're excited to meet you all! \" The natural voice under the synthetizer seemed sincere, almost eager. Alit couldn't understand the Captain and XO's reluctance. \"This is good news,\" he ventured. \"Now we can start negotiating with them to integrate them into the Empire, and bring their gods into our fol Before he could finish, Crusader Settn flattened his ears and almost bared his fangs at him, a reprimand so strong that it would usually be reserved for criminal misbehavior or negligence. Stunned, Alit was left wondering what had prompted that outburst. The Captain raised a calming hand and went on. \"While it would generally be a good thing, the Emperor and the Cardinals have determined that Earth is to remain quarantined indefinitely. You see, the Humans have exhibited throughout history a peculiar taste for making war.\" \"That's not exactly unusual, sir...\" Densk dared. And it wasn't. A lot of civilizations encountered by the Hiloi had martial cultures. The Byrhilf had lived in warring clans, the system-spanning Dieppal had established clashing planetary kingdoms, and the avian K'K'kt'K has settled all their bloodline disputes in all-out aerial combat between the males of each involved family. The Hiloi themselves did not relish war, but they knew of it. \"I mean, Captain, our own Sorrowful Matron taught us the ways of war...\" \"Perhaps, but the Sorrowful Matron teaches to strike quickly, cleanly and with resolve at the most valuable objectives. She never taught us savagery and destruction. Take a look at what information we have of their gods - artwork, video and other recovered media...\" More images sprang up from the display. A painting of a city, destroyed by a rain of fire as hapless survivors cowered before the divine. A man, naked but for a loincloth, twisting with pain on a wooden cross as blood dripped down to be collected in a cup, his face raised to the sky in silent prayer. A many-armed being, blue-skinned and dancing on a dead body, holding an assortment of weapons and battle trophies. A priest in a feathered robe plucking out the heart of a bound victim as a sacrifice atop a blood-caked pyramid. Another questioning a screaming, broken victim of torture before leading him to a woodpile and setting it alight. And yet another ululating religious cries in apparent ecstasy as he sliced through the throat of a helpless captive in a desert. The images went on and on until Alit felt sick to his stomach..... And he barely noticed when the Captain started speaking again. \"They worship gods of savagery and bloodthirst, who teach pain and destruction to those who would serve them. Send a message to the Fleet, the Cardinals and the Emperor Himself. Quarantine of Threshold of Redemption is broken. Mobilize all ships. Their gods can not be allowed to join ours - they can not be allowed allowed beyond their planet. There is no solution other than total war.\""}

{"original_text": "Total side note, but there was a place like this where I grew up. It served nothing but cheese or pepperoni pizza, and it stayed open super late. There was never any seating. At the end of my senior year of college, my friends and I stopped in the \"pizza place\" on the way home from a party, where I was promptly asked to leave by the owner after he told me to \"cut the shit\" when I asked for a menu. The next morning, I was woken up at 8am by the owner, who came to my parents house to apologize and beg me to come back to the pizza place. Apparently, he assumed I was a cop trying to shut him down for lack of a health license or some such nonsense. Best pizza in town. My friend once used the bathroom at a pizza place in Canada, when he came out there was a 5 surcharge on the bill. In an unrelated story, he once got pulled over in Canada for driving with a small air freshener hanging from his rear view mirror. It was a leaf. You cannot drive with leaves in your car in Canada. They really hate leaves. I have a friend who got in trouble for wearing a hat in Canada. There's no such thing as a \"Canadian\" This reminds me of a story my friend told me. He worked in a gas station in Canada, which of course also sold fast food. He told me about a man who came in and asked for a Whopper. There was only one left, and my friend put it in the microwave to heat it up. The man got pissed and stormed out. He came back about five minutes later and demanded that my friend give him that Whopper. The manager told him that he couldn't have it, it was no longer in the case. The man left but came back about ten minutes later. This time, he told my friend to give him the Whopper that was left in the microwave or he was going to have his manager fired. My friend told the man that he couldn't give him that Whopper because the microwave had to be cleaned before it could be used again. The man told him he had to give him that Whopper or he was going to get the manager fired, and he left. My friend and the manager were standing there and I guess he had a lot of time to think, because he looked at the manager and said, \"Do you have a Whopper? I need to get fired.\" I like the story where the guy asks for a Whopper, and the employee gives him a whopper. I would have loved it if this had been a true story. I would have loved it even more if he had also gotten fired. You know what I'd love even more? If the guy he gave it to was also named \"Brian.\" Woohoo. I'm a celebrity. I'm going to have to use that as my Halloween costume this year. And you can only have the costume if you pay me 5. My friend told me this story about his cousin, who used to work at a restaurant. Apparently, this one time, this lady was sitting at the bar and eating her meal. She ordered a beer with her meal and when she finished the meal, she told the waiter that she was leaving and wanted to take the beer with her. When the waiter told her that the beer was not to go, she started cursing him out. So, he went to get the manager, who told her that she could not take the beer. She then told the manager that she had tipped him and if he wanted to keep that tip, he would let her take the beer. He told her that he did not want her money and that she would not be taking the beer. So, she then told him that he could keep the beer, but he would be sued for every dollar he had. So, he told her that she could have the beer, but he was going to have to call the police. She told him to go ahead and call the police. So, he called the police and she was arrested for trespassing. Some people are just ridiculous. If you don't like that, you don't like freedom. I like that story. I'm also surprised that she was arrested, but I'm glad that she was. I don't know if you guys have ever been to a place called \"Barry's\" in the French Quarter, but I'd heard some horror stories about it and decided to check it out for myself.

It is, in a way, a comment on a situation we see in the news every day. He looked out over the meadows. The sun was setting, and the light had a certain softness to it. In the distance, he could see people out walking with their dogs, laughing and enjoying the sunshine. The breeze was soft, and carried with it a hint of the sea. A low cloud was forming over the mountains, but it was still some time until it would reach the town. It was a beautiful evening, and he felt a certain reluctance to go inside, to face his wife and tell her what he had to tell her. He could still see her in his mind. She had been a young, beautiful woman, full of life and laughter. She had brought sunshine into his life. She had made him believe that happiness and joy were actually possible. He had been a shell of a man when he had met her, and her love and optimism had been his saving grace. They had been married for twenty years, and he loved her. But lately, things had changed. She had changed. They had been happy for many years, but suddenly, it was as if she had lost her way. She no longer felt joy, she no longer saw beauty in the world. She had grown sad and angry. She no longer smiled. He had tried to help her, to convince her that she still had much to live for, but she did not believe him. She had started to lash out at him, blaming him for all the ills in the world. A part of him knew that it was not his fault. He knew that things in the world had changed, and that people had lost sight of the beauty in life. He knew that she was angry at something far beyond his reach. But still, a part of him took it personally. He saw her anger as a personal attack on himself. He felt that she was blaming him for everything, and that she had lost faith in him. He felt that he had failed her, and that she no longer believed in him. So, he had made a decision. He would do something that would make her happy. He would do something that would make her see that he cared about her. He would do something that would make her love him again. He stepped into the house, and looked at her. She was standing by the window, looking out. There was a strange light in her eyes, a strange glow that frightened him. He thought about what he was about to do, and felt a sense of trepidation. He had a feeling that this was going to be the most difficult thing he had ever done. He approached her. She turned to look at him, and her face was a mask of anger. He felt that he did not know this woman. She had changed so much. He took a deep breath, and tried to smile. \"I've got something to tell you,\" he said, and his voice trembled. She looked at him, and her eyes filled with suspicion. \"You've been lying to me, haven't you?\" she said, her voice hard. He felt the panic rise up in his throat. \"No,\" he said. \"It's nothing like that. It's something that will make you happy. I promise.\" She stared at him. She did not believe him. \"So, what is it then?\" she said, her voice cold. \"I've done something to make you happy,\" he said. \"What have you done?\" she said, her voice still cold. \"I've joined the army,\" he said. \"You've joined the army?\" she said, her voice rising. \"But you're a pacifist!\" \"I know,\" he said. \"But we need to defend our country. It's our duty.\" \"Our country?\" she said, her voice rising even further. \"What about us? What about our children? Do you care nothing for us?\" \"No,\" he said, trying to smile. \"I care for you. You know that. I do this for you, so that you will be happy again.\" \"You think that this will make me happy?\" she said, her voice still rising. \"This will make me happy? What are you saying?

But before I could speak or even looked at her, the little girl reached up and traced my scar, from my forehead all the way down to the bottom of my face, \" It's been ten years, but I found you guys. \" I looked at her face, her features exactly like Emily's. Her face was without emotions but still somehow expressed more hatred and betrayal than anything I can imagine. \" Mommy and Daddy, I found you guys! You guys thought you could get rid of me by throwing me away, but I found you guys! \" Frozen in place from guilt and regret, tears streamed from my face. \" Sorry about mommy, but the coin came up heads. \" I walked forward to hug her. A cold steel pierced my stomach. Silhouettes of liles drifted from the sky. The little girl started to cry. \" The other coin came up heads too. \" -008"}

{"original_text": "\"There's no time to think, man!\" What the hell? \"Get down! Hide!\" Where was the parade, the elephant? What is an elephant? I liked the elephant. I'm shaken from my thoughts by the sound of something approaching. I scramble to my feet, my heart beating a hundred times a second. A huge, gray behemoth is making its way towards me, its feet sinking into the muddy ground. It's an elephant, just like the one I saw earlier. Oh my God, I'm going to be trampled. I turn to run but I don't get very far before my body comes crashing down into the mud. I feel as if my heart is going to explode. My head throbs, and I try to stand up, but I can't. I lie there, face-down in the mud, feeling like I'm going to die. \"Hey! Hey you! Are you OK?\" a voice says. I'm too scared to look up. I don't know what is happening or what is going to happen next. I hear the voice again, closer this time. \"Are you OK?\" I turn my head to look up and see an elephant standing over me. I had seen elephants before. I'd seen them on TV, at the circus and at the zoo, but I had never been this close to one. I can see every hair on its hide, and every wrinkle in its skin. I can see the dirt under its toenails, and I can smell its foul breath. But the elephant doesn't seem to be angry. It is looking at me with kind eyes. It puts its trunk out to me and I take it in my hand. It is cold and wet, and it wraps itself around my arm. It pulls me up and I fall back into the mud. The elephant takes my hand again and pulls me up. \"Thank you,\" I say to it. \"Thank you so much.\" It takes me to a tree and I climb onto its back. It is not as comfortable as I had thought it would be, and I have to hold onto its ears to keep my balance. We travel slowly through the jungle, but I don't mind. I have the elephant. I have a friend. I'm not alone. \"Penny, it's time to go,\" my mother says. I am sitting in the kitchen, watching the two of them eating breakfast. I don't want to go. I don't want to leave my home. I don't want to leave my mother. \"Come on, Penny, it's going to be fun. We're going to see the elephants.\" I want to cry. I don't want to see the elephants. I don't want to see the parade. I don't want to see any of it. I want to stay here. I want my mother to come with me. I look at my mother. She's smiling at me, but I can see sadness in her eyes. She looks at my father, who is in his own little world, sipping his coffee and reading the paper. She tries to smile again, but I can see that it is fake. I don't want to go with him. I don't want to go to the parade. I want my mother to come with me. \"Penny, do you want some more juice?\" she asks, trying to change the subject. I shake my head no. I want her to come with me. I want to go back to bed, and then she will come and get me. I want her to come to my room, and hold me in her arms, and tell me that everything is going to be OK. I don't want to go to the parade. \"OK, honey,\" she says, \"put on your coat and let's go.\" I pull my arms away from her and turn my face away. I don't want to go to the parade. I don't want to go to the parade. I don't want to go to the parade. I don't want to go to the parade. I don't want to go to the parade. I don't want to go to the parade.

The Air Force.\" He sighed. \"The Air Force advanced you through their ranks quickly because you were the daughter of one of their darlings, and you demonstrated that you had her intuition and affability. You had a stellar career in store until you exploited every opportunity to sneak into their classified records in order to find evidence of a cover-up.\" \"What you're forgetting is that I did find evidence of a cover-up,\" she argued. \"You found evidence that her plane was found intact and sold to a private buyer in India through the black market. This indicates corruption, but no cover-up, and no aliens, young lady.\" \"Don't dismiss me because of my gender, Dad. I'm not so young and I'm definitely no lady. I also found evidence that they doctored her file after her disappearance to show that she was suffering from post-partum depression.\" \"Maybe it was doctored, or maybe her counselor was just updating the file for completeness.\" \"Five years after her last child was born? Or maybe they didn't want to pay out the insurance by ruling it a suicide.\" \"So now there's more than one conspiracy?\" \"Why can't there be?\" \"Because, Reggie, once you need multiple theories to support your paranoia, it conflicts with Occam's Razor.\" \"Dad, you went along with it because it suits your personal agenda. You didn't want the insurance payout, because it was affirmation that said she was really dead. You loved her and you never wanted that. You wanted to believe that she had post-partum depression, freaked out, shut off communications and flew off to India. You want to think that she never called you because she had a mental breakdown and started a new life.\" \"Whereas you think what, Reggie? Still aliens?\" \"Yes.\" Regina paused for dramatic effect. \"And she's home.\" She threw open the door to the parlor, where Adina sat, flipping through the news on her tablet. \"Did you have fun berating your father, dear?\" she said. \"Very much so.\" \"It's not kind, you know. He's been through a lot.\" Dex walked up to her, staring at her face as if it were a hallucination, then suddenly fell to his knees in front of her. He took her hand and began to cry. \"Dex, please don't. I lost the ability to cry years ago, and it makes me uncomfortable.\" \"Where did you go? Where have you been? My love...\" \"Haven't you been listening to your daughter? I was abducted by an alien armada as they tried to infiltrate Earth.\" \"Are you..... joking?\" \"Not at all. They forced my plane to land over the Marshall Islands, took me captive and forced me to teach them everything I knew about navigation, geography and modern technology. They couldn't leave me here while they regrouped at their home planet to make a battle plan, but the General took a fondness to me, and brought me home to Asphodel as his bride of war.\" Dex's jaw dropped. \"I fought him at first,\" she said quietly, \"but he was an expert at breaking people. I was light years from my family. It was either adapt to my new life, or die. I chose to live.\" \"I don't care. I'm glad you're home to stay, and we're going to make everything alright.\" \"What is here for me? A world that will be disgusted with me for betraying them? A husband, who will be disappointed by my failure to honor my marriage vows? A child who looks at me in pity as one who has been enslaved and abused? My life on Earth is gone, Dex. You have no idea how much joy it gives me to see Regina, tall and strong and healthy, but I have no other reason to stay. On Asphodel, I matter. I'm the woman who united and saved the planet. I'm a general, something I could never have achieved in the Air Force.\" \"Do you know how you inspired me, Mom?\" Regina said. \"You did everything in your power to ensure that we had a good childhood, even as you pursued your career. You taught us about the strength of being a woman in a world that is stacked against us. I can't believe that now you're just the thrall of a dictator.\" Adina pulled herself to her full height. \"Slow down one minute,\" she snapped. \"I'm not a thrall. Maybe I seemed to be, once, when my very survival depended on him, but things change. I direct my own life now. Would I be here now if he had any control over me?\" \"Tell me that you would rather be there on his ugly rock pelted by ugly rocks whose only aim is to pelt more rocks at other planets to turn them into ugly rocks too!\" Adina's lips turned up at that, and despite the tension in the room, both women laughed. \"Regina,\" she said quietly. \"You speak of strength. I can defend myself against almost any physical attack. I resisted the attempts of my kidnapper to break me emotionally, and turned him into my admirer. I command the loyalty of ten thousand troops, I use them as a force for societal change, and I have no issues with making difficult judgment calls and ordering those troops to their death. I do not, however, have the strength wake up every day and look into the eyes of a husband I betrayed.\" \"You're supporting a regime that will destroy Earth,\" Regina said. Adina waved her off. \"He won't destroy Earth. He just wants to unify Earth under the same authoritarian rule that has been so successful on Asphodel.\" \"Are you serious, Mom? You think that he can unite a strange planet, of which he has no understanding of the culture and complexity of international relations, by exporting a kind of government which barely worked on his own world?\" \"For the same reason that a family might see a counselor, Regina, it sometimes helps to have an external, expert point of view. He knows more than you think. He's been observing Earth for decades, after all.\" Regina snorted. Adina sighed. \"Alright. You're probably right. I'll overthrow the bastard.\" She stood up and kissed Regina on the cheek, and neatly stepped over the broken form of her ex-husband as she pressed a button on what looked like the remote starter for a car.

He took her hand and began to cry. \"Dex, please don't. I lost the ability to cry years ago, and it makes me uncomfortable.\" \"Where did you go? Where have you been? My love...\" \"Haven't you been listening to your daughter? I was abducted by an alien armada as they tried to infiltrate Earth.\" \"Are you..... joking?\" \"Not at all. They forced my plane to land over the Marshall Islands, took me captive and forced me to teach them everything I knew about navigation, geography and modern technology. They couldn't leave me here while they regrouped at their home planet to make a battle plan, but the General took a fondness to me, and brought me home to Asphodel as his bride of war.\" Dex's jaw dropped. \"I fought him at first,\" she said quietly, \"but he was an expert at breaking people. I was light years from my family. It was either adapt to my new life, or die. I chose to live.\" \"I don't care. I'm glad you're home to stay, and we're going to make everything alright.\" \"What is here for me? A world that will be disgusted with me for betraying them? A husband, who will be disappointed by my failure to honor my marriage vows? A child who looks at me in pity as one who has been enslaved and abused? My life on Earth is gone, Dex. You have no idea how much joy it gives me to see Regina, tall and strong and healthy, but I have no other reason to stay. On Asphodel, I matter. I'm the woman who united and saved the planet. I'm a general, something I could never have achieved in the Air Force.\" \"Do you know how you inspired me, Mom?\" Regina said. \"You did everything in your power to ensure that we had a good childhood, even as you pursued your career. You taught us about the strength of being a woman in a world that is stacked against us. I can't believe that now you're just the thrall of a dictator.\" Adina pulled herself to her full height. \"Slow down one minute,\" she snapped. \"I'm not a thrall. Maybe I seemed to be, once, when my very survival depended on him, but things change. I direct my own life now. Would I be here now if he had any control over me?\" \"Tell me that you would rather be there on his ugly rock pelted by ugly rocks whose only aim is to pelt more rocks at other planets to turn them into ugly rocks too!\" Adina's lips turned up at that, and despite the tension in the room, both women laughed. \"Regina,\" she said quietly. \"You speak of strength. I can defend myself against almost any physical attack. I resisted the attempts of my kidnapper to break me emotionally, and turned him into my admirer. I command the loyalty of ten thousand troops, I use them as a force for societal change, and I have no issues with making difficult judgment calls and ordering those troops to their death. I do not, however, have the strength wake up every day and look into the eyes of a husband I betrayed.\" \"You're supporting a regime that will destroy Earth,\" Regina said. Adina waved her off. \"He won't destroy Earth. He just wants to unify Earth under the same authoritarian rule that has been so successful on Asphodel.\" \"Are you serious, Mom? You think that he can unite a strange planet, of which he has no understanding of the culture and complexity of international relations, by exporting a kind of government which barely worked on his own world?\" \"For the same reason that a family might see a counselor, Regina, it sometimes helps to have an external, expert point of view. He knows more than you think. He's been observing Earth for decades, after all.\" Regina snorted. Adina sighed. \"Alright. You're probably right. I'll overthrow the bastard.\" She stood up and kissed Regina on the cheek, and neatly stepped over the broken form of her ex-husband as she pressed a button on what looked like the remote starter for a car. A thundering roar shook the house. \"I'll be home by Christmas.\""}

But it will be a little while before I can process the paperwork.\" Long had looked at him, and felt something go cold inside him. \"What do you want?\" \"I want a lot of things,\" the man said.

I looked at the kids. \"Because I want to make these kids happy.\" I said. It wasn't the original reason, but it was true. \"It makes me feel like I'm really helping. With that, Archangel's expression softened. \"What's your name?\" \"Selena.\" I answered. \"Thank you Selena. You're a real hero. Can you promise me something?\" \"What?\" \"Don't ever sell yourself short again. People like me, we're called superheroes for a reason. It takes something else altogether to impersonate me just to make these kids' day.\" Archangel grabbed my hand. \"Say, can I ask for one more thing?\" \"Sure. Anything you need.\" She whispered. \"What's your phone number.\" I wrote it down, and she smiled. \"Thank you. See you around.\""}

This was true, but when you lived in a town where nothing ever happened, there wasn't much to dream about. Finn felt the warm breeze on his face, heard the sound of the surf and the seagulls circling above. He listened to the cry of the seabirds and looked out at the crystal blue water. The water was so clear that he could see the sandy bottom and schools of fish swimming in the shallows. He could feel the hot sand beneath him, and smell the salty breeze. He heard the sound of voices as his friends called for him. Finn smiled and he turned to look. \"I'm over here!\" he shouted, but the words got caught in his throat, and he awoke with a start. For a moment, he wondered where he was. He heard the sound of his bedroom door being pushed open and felt the warmth of the summer sun on his face. He remembered where he was, and who he was. He was Finn. He was ten years old and lived in a little town called Middleton. He liked it here. It was home. He threw back his covers and got out of bed. He made sure he didn't wake his brother, Jake, who was still asleep. He walked to the window and looked out. It was a beautiful summer morning, and Finn couldn't wait to go outside and play. He pulled on a T-shirt and a pair of shorts, and he was ready to go. Finn went downstairs and walked into the kitchen. He could smell the coffee brewing and bacon frying. His mom was at the stove, making breakfast. He could see her in the mirror above the sink. She was wearing an apron and was making pancakes, too. \"Good morning, sweetheart,\" she said, turning around with a smile. \"What are you doing up so early?\" she asked. \"I couldn't sleep,\" he said. \"Oh, you had a bad dream again?\" she asked. \"No,\" he said. \"It was a good dream this time.\" \"Oh,\" she said, \"good.\" She turned back to the stove, and he noticed that she looked sad. \"What's wrong, Mom?\" he asked. \"Nothing,\" she said. \"I was just thinking about Dad, that's all.\" \"Why?\" he asked. \"Today would have been his birthday,\" she said. \"I was just remembering how much he loved birthdays.\" \"How old would he be today?\" Finn asked. \"He would have been forty-seven,\" she said. \"Oh, I know! That means I'm ten years old and he would be forty-seven,\" Finn said. \"He would have been twice my age.\" \"Something like that,\" she said. \"So tell me about your dream.\" \"Well, I was at the beach,\" Finn said. \"You were?\" she asked. \"Yeah. The water was clear, and I could see the bottom. I could see all the fish and everything,\" Finn said. \"That's wonderful,\" she said. \"Do you want to go to the beach this summer?\" \"Sure,\" he said. \"I just don't know if I want to go to the same old place, you know? I want to go somewhere new, where no one's ever been before.\" \"Where's that?\" she asked. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"It's just a dream.\" \"Honey, there is no place where no one's ever been before,\" she said. \"That's just the way it is.

{"original_text": "The old knight stood before the garden, where a crescent shaped pond would force those taking a stroll to deviate around either side, tempting them down any of the other paths between the hedges, down less-observed divisions of the compass. The hedges were overgrown, and the paths were barely visible now. Still, it was clear how magnificent the maze had been, once upon a time. The old knight's face seemed remorseful, his eyes distant, as if remembering those times. In the pond two koi fish danced around each other. One of them was gold, and the other black. The water would flicker with their colours as the sun glinted off their scales, and every time it did so a little rumble would send the water on the surface trembling, and sparks would fly out from the middle of the two fish. From down the path to the knight's left a rabbit emerged from underneath the hedgerow. Cautiously, sniffing the air, it determined that the maze was deserted and came out further. It was very fluffy and grey. The old knight stayed still, and the rabbit did not notice him. The rabbit foraged silently, its head buried in the grass. The way to the old knight's position was a singular path, paralleled on both sides by rose bushes. The roses grew in all different colours, on the same bush, from indigo to yellow and all the spectrum in between. Upon closer inspection, one would find that the petals were made of glass. It was said that in the middle of the maze was a fountain, or a tree. No one could decide which, as it was arguably both. The water spread upwards from the base, twisting and bubbling, until it rained down again in drips like a heavy rain, or the branches of a willow tree. No one knew what drinking from the fountain would do, not even the knight. No one had found the fountaintree for a long time. And eventually, people had stopped trying to find it. They were more likely to find the bodies of previous attempters, skeletons petrified in their final crawl, perhaps a finger stretched out, trying to point the way. Their skeletons rusted in the dew. And now the garden was overgrown, and it's secrets were unknown to all but the knight, and soon to be hidden forever. A hawk cast a shadow across the shoulders of the old knight, before diving to snatch the rabbit. The rabbit, all of a sudden surprised by the bird's dive, exploded into the white seeds of a dandelion, which were then scattered into the wind by the hawk's talons. The old knight stayed motionless, hands upon the pommel of his greatsword, his chin resting upon them. The hawk rose from its swoop, confused, and distracted, and so did not see the spiderweb stretched between the hedges. It's beak pierced the very middle, and the threads closed around her like a tattered cloak. She thrashed weakly as dozens of spiders revealed themselves amongst the leaves, shaking their spears and cheering. Music could be heard, simple tones that echoed over the maze, drifting closer and receding. The knight waited, and the music revealed itself as a dragonfly flew around one corner. It flew so fast, and turned at right angles, and each time it did so a tone rang out. A long time ago, a musical troop had tried to navigate the maze by mapping the tones to certain corners, as they had discovered a pattern. Nevertheless, they failed. The maze had other tricks, almost as many as it had stories. There were butterflies that set your clothes on fire if they landed on you. There were some passages that never ended. There were no exits besides that at which the old knight stood. The old knight would not enter the maze. Instead he stood, and watched, his stone face aged from the sun, wind, and moss. And the plaque at his feet said, \"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.\"", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "The old knight stood before the garden, where a crescent shaped pond would force those taking a stroll to deviate around either side, tempting them down any of the other paths between the hedges, down less-observed divisions of the compass.

Cover and interior design by Tylar Durbin As always, I would like to thank my editor, B. B. Wynter, for his support and advice. As the cool air of early September blows across New York, I sit here, watching the sunset out my bedroom window. The sky is a vivid mix of orange, pink, and purple. The sun is almost completely hidden by the clouds that are slowly drifting by. I'm sure it's a beautiful sight. But I can't help but feel that this is the last time I'll see it. I'll be gone, away from my friends, away from my home. I wonder if I'll ever see them again. I could ask why me, but that was no good. I couldn't absolve myself of the responsibility of my own actions. I had brought this on myself, and now I had to deal with it. I sit up and turn on my laptop. I check my e-mail, but I get nothing important. I log into my Facebook account and start scrolling through my news feed. There is nothing new, nothing worth reading. I go back to the homepage and open a new tab. I type my URL into the address bar. . I watch as my cursor hovers over the login button. I go to click it, but my hand freezes. The cursor sits there, motionless, taunting me. I stare at it, but my gaze turns to the screen. I know what's waiting for me there. I know what I'll see. I don't want to see it, but I do. I have to. I have to know what's going on. I have to know who is talking about me. I click the button, and I am brought to a list of the latest news on Prestonia Academy's campus. I scroll down until I find my name. Posted by Jason Olson \"Tylar, how could you?\" What did I do? What could I have done? Posted by Jessica Healy \"This is a total betrayal.

{"original_text": "\"Those two blanks are \"z.\" \"So..... Zyzzyva?\" \"Sure. It's a word.\" I smirk triumphantly as I put down the tiles for my triple-word-score word, putting me 64 points ahead of my little sister, Kitty. She's an English whiz, but I'm better at making words. I have a reputation as the champion Scrabble player in our family, and I'm determined to keep it up. My family is pretty good at games, and we've got a pretty good set up in our living room. My parents are playing Apples to Apples. I've heard that it's a pretty fun game, but it's not my kind of game. My sister, Kitty, is playing Clue with her boyfriend, Jake. Jake is staying with us for a week, since his parents are on vacation and he didn't have anywhere else to go. Kitty and Jake are both 17, and they met in their drama club last year. They've been dating for almost a year. I'm a 15-year-old girl who loves to read and write, and I'm about to start a new school. I'm a little nervous about it, and I'm pretty sure that I'm not going to like it. I'm sitting here with my back to the TV, which is on the wall next to the fireplace. I have to put up with the sound of my parents' game, but it's not too bad. Jake and Kitty are sitting on the couch next to me, and Jake is watching me play Scrabble with my mom. I'm sure he's thinking that I'm weird, since my mom and I are both obsessed with games. I've been winning this game by a pretty big margin, and I know that I'm annoying my mom. I can tell that she's about to give up, since she hasn't been playing very well tonight. I'm almost done with my turn, and I'm really hoping that I don't mess up this time. I've been lucky with my letters, but I've been missing a lot of easy words. I think I might have an idea for a word for my last blank. \"OK, I think I'm done now.\" I look at my mom with a smirk. I've got a pretty good word. \"Do you have a word?\" I ask her. \"No, I'm going to pass.\" She puts down her tiles, and I look at them. She's got a Z and a J. She's going to try to put them on a triple-word-score. I know that I'm not going to beat her this time, but I need to finish my turn before she can make her move. I look at my tiles again. I've got a Q, a Z, a Y, a W, and a U. I put down my Q, my Z, and my Y, and I make my word. I'm a little surprised at how well I did this time, since I've been missing a lot of easy words tonight. I put down my tiles and take a deep breath. I can't believe how well I did this turn. \"What's your word?\" I ask my mom. \"It's...... \"Quizzywizzy!\" she says with a smile. She's never been good at this game, and I've gotten used to her making up words. This one was pretty good, though. I look at the board. \"It's not a word, but that's OK.\" I shrug. \"You're going to have to check your dictionary.\" \"I know, but I'm OK with that.\" She smiles at me. I smile back. She's a good sport about me winning all the time. My dad laughs at us from the other side of the room. He's still playing his game, and he's still doing pretty well. \"We should get out the dictionary and check it.\" I say to my mom. I reach for the Scrabble dictionary and open it up. \"Quizzywizzy.\" I start to look up the word. \"It's not in here.\" My mom looks at me with a smile. \"I'm not surprised. It was a good try.\" \"I guess that I'll just have to accept my defeat.\" She shrugs. \"It's OK.

I put down my tiles and take a deep breath. I can't believe how well I did this turn. \"What's your word?\" I ask my mom. \"It's...... \"Quizzywizzy!\" she says with a smile. She's never been good at this game, and I've gotten used to her making up words. This one was pretty good, though. I look at the board. \"It's not a word, but that's OK.\" I shrug. \"You're going to have to check your dictionary.\" \"I know, but I'm OK with that.\" She smiles at me. I smile back. She's a good sport about me winning all the time. My dad laughs at us from the other side of the room. He's still playing his game, and he's still doing pretty well. \"We should get out the dictionary and check it.\" I say to my mom. I reach for the Scrabble dictionary and open it up. \"Quizzywizzy.\" I start to look up the word. \"It's not in here.\" My mom looks at me with a smile. \"I'm not surprised. It was a good try.\" \"I guess that I'll just have to accept my defeat.\" She shrugs. \"It's OK. I'm used to losing.\" I look at the board again. \"I'm going to win this one.\" I"}

{"original_text": "[ Loop 89 ] The heavy din of the coffee shop enveloped all of us and distracted me from what Conner was saying. None of it made sense anyway. He was talking about a \"loop\" or something like that. I wasn't really paying attention because I was watching the cars pull in and out of the parking lot. \"What are you talking about?\" I interrupted. He just looked at me and repeated himself. \"You're telling me that there is a huge loop of time out there and we're trapped inside it?\" I asked. He smiled again and shrugged his shoulders. \"That's incredible,\" I said. Conner wasn't making any sense. We all knew the world had changed after the storms. We'd been forced to change with it. We'd all been relocated to a large stadium. The stadium became our home and our new world. We adapted. We learned to live like this and it became normal. We were all stuck in this large stadium, a large mass of humanity trapped together. We were the lucky ones. We had a safe place to live and food to eat. Many of our people had not been so lucky. Many people did not survive the storms. Our world had changed. Conner's explanation of how it had changed made no sense to me. \"The storms changed the world. I've known that for a long time. I don't understand how you can travel between them,\" I said. \"It's not that hard to do. You just have to understand the way it works. The loop is everywhere. It's all around you. You just have to be able to see it and be able to get there.\" \"That's why I am here,\" he said. \"You're going to teach me how to travel through time?\" I asked. \"Time travel is one of the more advanced forms of travel. It's not the best place to start. First, we have to get you to understand the basics.\" \"The basics?\" \"The basics of traveling through the loop. Everything you see, everything you experience in your life is part of the loop. The loop is an infinity loop. You can travel to any point in the loop. The past, present, or future. It's all the same to the loop. You just have to know how to get there.\" \"You're talking about time travel again,\" I said. \"Yes, but it's a little more complicated than you think.\" \"I don't understand. How can I travel through the loop?\" \"Well, you can travel through the loop by walking through it. Everything in the loop is connected. If you understand this connection you can access any part of the loop you wish to.\" \"I'm not following you,\" I said. \"Take a moment and think about the loop. Think about everything that has happened to you. Think about your life before the storms. Think about how the storms changed everything. Think about how you ended up here in this stadium, sitting in this coffee shop with me. If you can understand that, you can understand how you can travel through the loop.\" I sat and stared at Conner. I looked around the coffee shop at the other people. I could see the fear and the pain in their eyes. They were all looking for answers. They were all looking for some hope. \"I've seen the future, Conner,\" I said. \"I know. You're not the only one,\" Conner said. \"I've seen the future,\" I said again. \"I've seen a better world. A world without the storms. A world where we are free. A world that is ours,\" I said. \"You've seen the future. That's part of the loop. You just have to learn how to get there.\" \"I'm going to learn how to travel through time?\" I asked. \"Not time travel, exactly,\" Conner said. \"I will teach you how to travel through the loop. The loop is everywhere. It's all around us. You just have to learn how to find it and how to access it.\" \"You're saying that I can travel through time?\" \"That's exactly what I am saying. You can travel through time. We are all traveling through time. We're just traveling through it in a loop.\" \"I don't understand. How can I travel through time?\" I asked. \"I'm glad you asked.

You've got a good feeling about this, huh?\" \"I do. I do.\" John smiled. \"It's about the future.\" Barry tried to match his smile. \"You've got that right.\" Bonnie walked into the room, and John's smile evaporated. \"Hey, Bonnie,\" Barry called. \"Over here.\" Bonnie found them and hugged John. \"Hey, I didn't expect to see you here.\" \"I came to say hello,\" John said. \"And to tell you that you can't fire me.\" \"I can't fire you?\" Bonnie smiled. \"Why not?\" \"Because I know the future.\" \"Is that right?\" Bonnie's smile faded. \"And what does the future say?\" \"You won't fire me.\" \"How do you know that, John?\" \"I know that you won't fire me, and that I'll never leave this company.\" \"You'll never leave?\" \"Never.

The future is in our hands, and I'm going to do everything I can to ensure that we're all successful.\" Barry leaned against the wall and watched John walk away. \"Not everything.\" The room was full of people, most of whom John didn't recognize. He nodded at them as he made his way to the head of the room. Barry caught up to him. \"Hey, wait a second.\" John turned to him. \"What?\" \"I still don't know what this is about.\" \"It's about our future, Barry. Our future.\" \"So what about this future?\" John glanced around. \"It's in my hands. I can make sure it's good, or I can make sure it's bad. I want to make sure it's good.\" \"You're in a good mood.

I do.\" John smiled. \"It's about the future.\" Barry tried to match his smile. \"You've got that right.\" Bonnie walked into the room, and John's smile evaporated. \"Hey, Bonnie,\" Barry called. \"Over here.\" Bonnie found them and hugged John. \"Hey, I didn't expect to see you here.\" \"I came to say hello,\" John said. \"And to tell you that you can't fire me.\" \"I can't fire you?\" Bonnie smiled. \"Why not?\" \"Because I know the future.\" \"Is that right?\" Bonnie's smile faded. \"And what does the future say?\" \"You won't fire me.\" \"How do you know that, John?\" \"I know that you won't fire me, and that I'll never leave this company.\" \"You'll never leave?\" \"Never.

How does that make you feel?\" \"Good,\" John said. \"Like I can do something good for the company. I'm going to be here forever.\" \"And that's a good thing, John?\" \"It's the best thing. I can make the company great.\" \"How are you going to make the company great, John?\" John turned to Bonnie and smiled. \"I'm going to make sure it's in the future.

{"original_text": "Jim had drawn the short straw for night shift in the engine room. He would have volunteered if he hadn't. Night shift was nice, the lights were dimmed aboard the ship in the off hours, stem to stern. Captain's orders, it allowed better regulation of circadian rhythms for the rest of the crew and let Jim avoid the dazzling brilliance that passed for \"day\" aboard the cruiser. He supposed it was his fault, born and raised on Sian where the noon time sun was little brighter than a full moon on Earth. The engine hummed softly as Jim performed routine maintenance. The other man on duty was Stuart, about as salty a sailor as Jim had ever seen, with hair that grew only in patches and a scar that ran from jaw to eyebrow beneath an eye patch. Jim was more than a little afraid of Stu. \"Fluid'll need changing\" Jim nearly leaped from his skin. Drawing a shaking breath he responded \"maintenance logs shows it was changed eight hours ago.\" \"Maintenance logs is wrong, then. Changed up the fluid but didn't clean the filter. Always clean the filter. Drain, clean the filter, fill. Not so hard is it?\" \"Er, no...\" Jim checked the dip stick and noted the reactor cyclant was a touch discolored. \"Well tell that to the day shift crew! Filter needs cleaning every time the fluid's changed. You're not like Alston, I can tell. Pompos ass, thinks'cuz he studied engineering he knows how to be an engineer. Well I say if you want clean cyclant you need a clean filter. I know this engine inside and out I do. Come here, I'll show you how to clean the filter.

So now let's talk about the airlocks.\" \"Airlocks?\" Jim asked, taking the proffered flask. It held rum, strong enough to make his eyes water and sweet as candy. \"Aye, the airlocks. You'll use'em now and again, replace ablation plate, drive needs work on the outside, you'll make your way outside from time to time. But it's the airlocks you need to look out for.\" \"What do you mean?\" He took another swig and passed the flask back. \"You're not the first lad in space, Jim, and you certainly won't be the last.

You heard of the Machanna?\" \"Sure, heard about it in school, lost to the stars out around Tau 3, it's held up as a prime example of design failure.\" \"Oh aye, coolant had to be jettisoned from outside, had to be done once a week or the reactor'd overheat. Did they tell you in academy why they couldn't? No, I suppose not. That's not a popular story, not sanctioned and all that. Well they gave the job to a new kid, a sort of hazing. Coolant was a gel back then, was real funny to tell the new kid he needed to clean his suit before they could let him back in. Well, they gave the kid the job, and of course he gets the coolant all over himself, no way not to. They tell him he's got ta clean his suit before they let him back in, so he starts to panic, yeah, because he's already low on air. He flails around a bit, loses most of his tools, everything but his number six scraper. The folks inside see him and tell him to stop, but he's not listenin' see, because he things he's got to clean his suit. So he starts at it with the scraper, and you can't clean a suit with a scraper, it just can't be done, and sure as shit the suit gets a puncture. \"Now the boy was in a fuss before, but now he's in a panic. They're shouting over the radio to get inside the airlock, it's good enough, it was just a joke. Finally the kid gets the message, and pulls himself in. He's bleedin air fast and they dump emergency tanks to equalize the pressure inside the airlock. Kid thinks he's safe and pulls off his helmet. He's half blind, sweat in his eyes, out of breath, so he reaches up to open the door, but the airlock's faulty, the outer door blows off, vents the atmosphere in the airlock and takes the kid with it.\" \"Holy shit.\" \"So the crew's watchin him out there. They don't tell you in academy, but vacuum doesn't kill you like they used to think it did.

{"original_text": "I was too busy failing my AP History Class to notice her at first. Obviously, I hate history- it's boring and feels as though all we ever do is learn about the achievements of someone who we can't relate to at all. That's no reason to fail it- I was failing because I wouldn't do my damn work. Rachel was the top student in the class, getting the questions right every time she was called on. She had been seated behind me from the beginning of the year, and yet I didn't notice her before that one fateful Wednesday in early November. The rain that was coming down outside the windows of the classroom was heavy and cold, the typical state of November rain in southern Michigan. Our teacher, Mr. Harvey, was droning on about something that was probably interesting to someone who had never heard a history lesson in their life- and had never heard anything about the Mongols. The sound of the rain hitting the ground outside, combined with the warmth of the room, created a deadly combination. My eyelids had begun to droop, and I could feel myself falling asleep. \"I like your drawing.\" Rachel's voice pierced the fog in my head. \"Mmm?\" I mumbled, turning to face her. She had pulled her curly blond hair back behind her ears, and her sea green eyes seemed to pierce me. \"The one that you're working on.\" She smile, revealing two rows of perfect teeth. Suddenly, I became fully awake. \"You mean the one of the mountains?\" I asked softly, careful not to attract attention. She nodded. I stared at her. \"I my voice shook slightly, \"haven't shown that to anyone. It's at my house. How do you-?\" She chuckled, cutting me off. Slowly, she raised her hand and hit the desk, very softly. The rain stopped. The voice of my teacher vanished. The room was frozen in time. \"I like your drawing.\" She repeated softly. \"Let's leave it at that.\" \"What's going on?\" My mind raced.

Obviously, I hate history- it's boring and feels as though all we ever do is learn about the achievements of someone who we can't relate to at all. That's no reason to fail it- I was failing because I wouldn't do my damn work. Rachel was the top student in the class, getting the questions right every time she was called on. She had been seated behind me from the beginning of the year, and yet I didn't notice her before that one fateful Wednesday in early November. The rain that was coming down outside the windows of the classroom was heavy and cold, the typical state of November rain in southern Michigan. Our teacher, Mr. Harvey, was droning on about something that was probably interesting to someone who had never heard a history lesson in their life- and had never heard anything about the Mongols. The sound of the rain hitting the ground outside, combined with the warmth of the room, created a deadly combination. My eyelids had begun to droop, and I could feel myself falling asleep. \"I like your drawing.\" Rachel's voice pierced the fog in my head. \"Mmm?\" I mumbled, turning to face her. She had pulled her curly blond hair back behind her ears, and her sea green eyes seemed to pierce me. \"The one that you're working on.\" She smile, revealing two rows of perfect teeth. Suddenly, I became fully awake. \"You mean the one of the mountains?\" I asked softly, careful not to attract attention. She nodded. I stared at her. \"I my voice shook slightly, \"haven't shown that to anyone. It's at my house. How do you-?\" She chuckled, cutting me off. Slowly, she raised her hand and hit the desk, very softly. The rain stopped. The voice of my teacher vanished. The room was frozen in time. \"I like your drawing.\" She repeated softly. \"Let's leave it at that.\" \"What's going on?\" My mind raced. I raised my hand, slowly extending a finger to point at her. \"You aren't human.\" I shouted. \"Very bright.\" Again, she laughed. \"You're right, I'm not human.

I rush out from behind the dumpster, and see that the people are gone. And one of them is on the ground. \"NO!\" I scream, before I rush over to the person, who I recognize as Krystel. I get down on my knees, and try to wake her up. \"Come on, Krystel! Wake up!\" I scream. \"We need you! We need your help!\" I place my ear to her chest, and listen.

{"original_text": "As long as I can remember, I've been digging holes. And I don't just mean here at Brightwood, in the shade of the solemn oaks; my fascination with earthly excavation started young. At the tender age of two, I was already scraping craters out of our front lawn - something my father found amusing, despite my mother's furious stares. He was a man of discovery, always tinkering away at something or other in his garage workshop, and I took to his example from the beginning. By age eleven, I had finished the tunnel system underneath our backyard, complete with sleeping quarters and a dining room. My father beamed as I rushed from entrance to exit, showing off my hard work. That night, my mother put her foot down. They shipped me off to Winghamton Prep shortly after that. Mother thought it would knock some sense into me - get me to see that there was more to life than digging holes - but she could not have been more wrong. Within six months, the groundskeepers were complaining of a gopher infestation; in a year, I'd turned the underside of Barclay Hall into a tunneled paradise. I heard my name whispered during lulls in lunchtime conversation: Gary Parsons, Master of the Underground. Everyone wanted to see my work. For the first time since the day I showed my father the house passages, I was happy. The structural collapse of Barclay Hall put an end to that. There was never supposed to be a party in the tunnels; the popular crowd took what they thought was theirs and paid the price. I watched from across the green, tears streaming down my face, as rescue workers combed the rubble for survivors. My world lay in ruins, my classmates buried forever in the halls of my design.

And I don't just mean here at Brightwood, in the shade of the solemn oaks; my fascination with earthly excavation started young. At the tender age of two, I was already scraping craters out of our front lawn - something my father found amusing, despite my mother's furious stares. He was a man of discovery, always tinkering away at something or other in his garage workshop, and I took to his example from the beginning. By age eleven, I had finished the tunnel system underneath our backyard, complete with sleeping quarters and a dining room. My father beamed as I rushed from entrance to exit, showing off my hard work. That night, my mother put her foot down. They shipped me off to Winghamton Prep shortly after that. Mother thought it would knock some sense into me - get me to see that there was more to life than digging holes - but she could not have been more wrong. Within six months, the groundskeepers were complaining of a gopher infestation; in a year, I'd turned the underside of Barclay Hall into a tunneled paradise. I heard my name whispered during lulls in lunchtime conversation: Gary Parsons, Master of the Underground. Everyone wanted to see my work. For the first time since the day I showed my father the house passages, I was happy. The structural collapse of Barclay Hall put an end to that. There was never supposed to be a party in the tunnels; the popular crowd took what they thought was theirs and paid the price. I watched from across the green, tears streaming down my face, as rescue workers combed the rubble for survivors. My world lay in ruins, my classmates buried forever in the halls of my design.

{"original_text": "I was one of the lucky ones. At the edge of the village, the river pools into a large circle for my friends and I to swim in. When the river is low, the water is shallow enough to play in. On the far side of the river, there is a forest. The forest is not forbidden to us, but it is dangerous. Only fools and the most curious go there. My friends and I swim across the river to the forest and play there. Our parents tell us that the forest is where the bad people live. They say there are wolves and bears and wild dogs that will tear us to shreds. They say there are bad people, too, bandits and thieves who will steal us away or kill us. We are never supposed to go there, but we are children and we don't listen. The forest is beautiful. It is dark and green and lush. The trees are tall and full, the underbrush thick and thorny. My friends and I climb to the top of the tallest trees, and there we sit, staring out at the wide-open fields of the village. We feel so free and powerful. We feel so safe. We don't notice the wolves and bears and wild dogs prowling through the trees below. There is a tree in the middle of the forest that is the tallest tree of all. The branches are long and thick, and my friends and I climb them every day. We sit on the branches, swing our legs, and pretend to fly. We laugh at the other children in the village, jealous that we are able to fly. We are safe. No one can reach us here. Today is a hot day. There is no wind, and the sun is strong. I have been climbing the tallest tree all day. I am tired and sweaty. My legs are weak. I can no longer feel my feet. I can no longer feel my hands. I can no longer feel my arms. I am tired, so I climb down and return to the pool. The pool is warm. The sun is hot. I lie down in the water, but it is too warm to sleep. I wish for the wind to come. I wish for the wind to cool me down. I wish for the wind to carry me away. I am so tired. I try to stay awake, but I cannot. I fall asleep in the pool. The pool is warm. The water is soft. I sleep. I wake to the sound of someone calling my name. I look up and see my mother. She is standing on the other side of the pool, waving her arms, shouting. She is shouting my name, but I can't hear her. The sound of the water is too loud. She is screaming, but I cannot hear her. She waves her arms, but I cannot see her. The sun is in my eyes. I can't see anything. I look down. The water is cool, soft, and comfortable. I want to sleep some more. I want to swim and climb the trees. I am so tired. I am so tired. I look up. My mother is crying. She is screaming my name. She is waving her arms. She is running towards me. She is running to save me. I am tired. I am so tired. I cannot move. I cannot escape. I cannot wake up. The water is warm. The water is soft. The water is comfortable. I want to sleep some more. I want to climb the trees and fly. I am so tired. I am so tired. I want to sleep some more. A shadow falls over me. A hand reaches down and grabs me. It is my mother. She is pulling me out of the pool. I am so heavy. I am so tired. I am so heavy. I can't move. I can't wake up. I am so heavy. She is trying to pull me out of the pool, but I am too heavy. I am too tired. I cannot wake up. I cannot help her. I am too heavy. I am too tired. I cannot help her.

The man before her was very well composed and obviously experienced. He did not seem to be impressed with meeting the president for the first time. \" So what is this about? My calender only mentions your name and that you are a scientist of some unspecified sort. \" she said. \" Well, that is true, although I would put more on my business card, if I had one. I am the director of a research institution that was founded in late 2002 to examine an object of alien origin. \" he said. Hillary knew that many scientists mused about the possibility of aliens, but she had never been interested in that discussion. She knew she should probably be excited about the fact that alien life was apparently confirmed, but she had gotten used to the president-routine now and quickly got on with the practical details. \" Okay. Interesting. How expensive is it and what results have you come up with? \" she asked bluntly. \" It is very expensive. Currently we are using about 100 billion dollars annually, and it used to be higher. \" he said. He looked down for a short moment and then continued. \" And as for the results, we are only working on containment, and it is successfully being contained. .\" That was a large number. She should have noticed such an amount of money in the budgets. \" I am pretty familiar with the government finances. How do you manage to get that amount of money? I'm pretty sure I haven't seen'Alien research' on any of the budget proposals. \" she said with a smile. \" We get it through the military spending of the State Department. \" he said. Well the State Department spending did go up 350 billion between 2002 and 2010 but.... \" But how did you get it while the war in Iraq was going on? \" she inquired. \" The war wasn't as expensive as reported. So we just got the extra overhead. \" he replied. Hillery hoped this wasn't the only reason they had gone to Iraq. \" Okay. You said you were working on containment only? What kind of object is this? \" \" Yes, \" he said \" The object is a perfect cube about 1 meter across. We discovered it in the middle of a meteor crater surrounded by a 5 meter thick spherical shield. The inner part of the shield was made of gold and the outer part was made of a very heat resistant and durable alloy. \" Hillary didn't care much for the technical aspects, but it seemed well rehearsed, so she didn't interrupt. \" But although the shield was very resistant against blunt force impact, it was easy enough to cut open. So in 2004, we did. We accounted for everything, and prepared for the worst. Even if the cube had been made out of antimatter, the bunker would have contained the explosion. At first, after we opened the sphere, it was rather anticlimactic. Just a black cube, covered in a slimy substance. After a few minutes our initial analysis showed that the substance contained an acid, perfect for dissolving the explosion-proof container we had made. We quickly encapsulated it in a plastic container, that the acid should have been inert to, but after a few minutes the substance changed properties and started dissolving the plastic. \" he explained. Mr. Smith shrugged his shoulders and continued. \" We ended up placing it inside the original gold container again. \" That did sound anticlimactic. \" So I guess that accounts for the expenses up to 2004. What did you do afterwards? \" Hillary asked. \" Well, after we had closed up the gold shell, we detected an extremely small vibration from inside. It turns out, that the substance contained micro machinery which was drilling through the gold. This seemed strange since it could have done that before we brought it in. However, it became clear that this object was harvesting energy from the environment and using this to break down the gold. We discovered it because it drilled far less in the gold after we turned off the lights when replacing the shield. \" Mr Smith explained. \" Soon after it completely stopped drilling. We hoped that it meant that it had run out of energy, which could perhaps allow us to do more experiments on it. But after a few months of being in the same container, it suddenly started making its microscopic holes in the gold like it was drilling through butter. We just barely avoided a containment breach, and afterwards we found out, that it had probably harvested energy from combination of two things. A small thermal gradient, and vibration energy from a motor running nearby. \" \" A thermal gradient? \" Hillary asked with one eyebrow raised. Now she had let him talk uninterrupted for long enough. Scientists often seemed to have a habit of sliding into an overly technical jargon when they had been talking for too long. \" Sorry, it's when there are two different temperatures on each side of an object. It can be used to generate energy, but it's usually in so tiny amounts that - \" \" Okay ,\" Hillary interrupted before he could get going again. \" So it seems like it wants to escape, and you are trying to contain it, although it's proving to be difficult. \" \" Yes, but the fact that it suddenly started storing its energy instead of constantly drilling, implies that it understands, that it is being contained and it is getting smarter about escaping. This caused us to ramp up the security. There now are quite a lot of layers of different protection mechanisms in place. \" Mr. Smith clarified. Hillary could see the difficulties, but it did not seem to make sense. Why was it trying to escape? \" Have you tried communicating with it? \" She asked. \" Well, we have tried. We drill small holes in the gold shield to interact with the object and send in signals. Mostly low power, low frequency communication, as we don't want to give it energy. So far the only response we have gotten is dissolving equipment. \" he said while shrugging his shoulders again. \" We don't know what it's for or why it's here on earth. We do have some ideas, and they seem to universally conclude that keeping the object isolated from its surroundings is the best course of action. \" \" Can you elaborate on the ideas? How can you possibly conclude anything from an object that doesn't communicate? \" Hillary asked sceptically. \" Well, we know it was sent to earth in a shell that isolated the object. So someone, somewhere thought that sending it without a prison was a bad idea. The question is, why not just throw it into the sun, if they didn't want it to be free? Were they afraid that it would harvest all the energy instead of breaking? But then why not send it out of the galaxy? \" Mr. Smith mused. \" Maybe it is intelligent and destructive. The civilization that banished it might be so peaceful, that they could not get themselves to sentence it to death as they should have. \" \" It could also be a friendly gift, wanting to help create peace on earth and the only reason it doesn't just explain this to us is because it doesn't have enough energy to maintain coherent thoughts.

Some of you may believe that we have been doing it for years, but that's wrong. We have been doing it for sixteen days. But now we are sure that there is no mistake and that it's pointless to conceal our discovery.\" I sip the remains of the cold tea I had left on my table before going to bed early, wondering if I'm still dreaming.

It is very unlikely to have been delivered by any unmanned mission we are aware about. There are no known landing sites in its vicinity. We can't identify any tracks around it, but there might be something under the dust that we can find after careful examination. Perhaps we will have to send another rover equipped specifically for this mission now that we know what to look for.\" \"Anyway, we have found an artifact, it took us sixteen days to get to it and inspect it. We have no doubt that it is a Soviet flag.\" The old TV shows a series of photos of a flag hanging on a pole. On the progression of photos it looks twitchy. \"The Martian wind isn't usually strong enough to make it wave, but what can be seen in the upper left corner of it is definitely sickle and hammer. We don't know of any mission that was capable of delivering it. The Soviet rovers from missions Mars-2 and Mars-3 couldn't carry it for sure, and Mars-4NM and Mars-5NM were canceled due to lack of a sufficiently powerful heavy carrier rocket.\" \"Curiosity is equipped with the ChemCam instrument, which allows to vaporise a cubic millimeter of matter with a laser burst and inspect its composition via spectrography. Unfortunately we can't examine the flag itself as it is too high, all that's available is the pole.\" \"And so we did it. We analyzed the pole.

One of the boys stopped Paul. \"Hey, you need to be on my team,\" the boy said. \"I'm captain.\" Paul knew what it meant to be on someone's team. He knew that being on the captain's team was special.

The heat made the air boil and dance. Ash flew in all directions, mixing with the red glow of the flames. Great chunks of burning timber toppled into the streets, and as they fell, they set fire to all around them. The city was now a place of screams and cries, and flames and fury. Behind the smoke lay the city of Amrath. Long ago, it had been a place of beauty and power. It was now a place of sorrow and death. The city had been brought to its knees by invaders from the east. The invaders were the Atuahuan tribes, or, as the people of Amrath called them, the 'Dark Men'. They came from a land so far away that it was a mystery even to the wisest of scholars. The Dark Men were an ancient people, dark-skinned, powerful and evil. They had a natural talent for magic, and they could use it to fight and kill. Amrath had been taken by surprise, and it had fallen swiftly. The Atuahuan tribes had razed the city. They had burned every building, and killed every person that they could find. They had killed all the people that they could find. There were no more farmers, no more traders, no more scholars. They had killed all the people. Well, almost all of them. The girl had been running for many hours. She had run through the streets of Amrath, and had run from her home. She had run away from her mother and father. She had run away from the Atuahuan warriors. She had run away from the flames, and the shouts, and the screams. She had run away from the smell of smoke and death. Her name was Lilith. She was twelve years old. Her hair was dark, and her eyes were large. She had the look of a person who had seen too much. Her clothes were made of linen, but they were covered in dirt. Her bare feet were cut and bruised. She was sobbing and gasping for breath. She was running for her life. Behind her, the city burned. Lilith had managed to avoid the Dark Men. They had killed many people in the city, but they had not killed her. But she knew that it was only a matter of time before they caught her. She had known that she could not stay in Amrath. She had to get away. She had no family left. She had no friends left. She had nowhere left to go. She had to leave Amrath. That was when she found the tunnel. The tunnel had been built long before, and it had been used to carry water to Amrath. It led from the centre of the city, up to the hills that surrounded Amrath. It was dark and it was damp. It was filled with rubble, and there were a number of places where it was blocked. But there were places where it was still open. Lilith followed the tunnel. She crawled through the darkness. She knew that she could not go back. She could only go forward. As she went, she heard a noise. It was the sound of men, and horses, and drums. The Dark Men were coming. They were chasing her. They would find her. They would kill her. But she could not turn back. She went on. She ran through the darkness. She kept going. She did not stop. She came to a hole in the wall. It was a small hole. It was just big enough for a person to squeeze through. Lilith squeezed through. She found herself in the open air. She was at the end of the tunnel. The night was clear and cold. The moon was high in the sky. It lit up the land around her. Lilith was high on a hill. Amrath lay below her. The city was burning. Lilith could not see it. She was not allowed to see it. She had to turn away. She could not look at it. She could not look at her city. She turned her face to the hills. She looked at the way ahead. She began to run.

I have a lot of questions I'd like to ask life. Most of them start with \"why\" and end with \"fuck you.\" But the question I want to ask life the most right now is \"Why are you so goddamn hard to predict?\" I have an 8 month old son. His name is Isaac. I love him more than anything in this world, and I would do anything for him. But it is so hard to know what is best for him. I always thought I knew how I would be as a parent. I had the whole plan laid out. I'd have a nanny, I'd stay home, I'd still have time to do all the things I wanted to do, like write, act, work on my stand-up. Isaac would be involved in all of those things, because that is how it was supposed to be. But there is a lot of life that happens between when you are born, and when you turn 30. And what happened to me was I got really sick. And I lost my ability to work, I lost my ability to take care of myself, I lost my ability to do anything without intense pain. I was diagnosed with 10 different incurable autoimmune diseases, and just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, I was diagnosed with a brain tumor. There are so many days where I just break down. I break down so hard, I have to leave my house. I can't be in my home, because it is too painful. I break down so hard that my husband calls me and just says \"Hey, are you okay? You sound weird.\" And I say \"I'm okay, I'm just having a moment.\" And he says \"Okay, well call me if you need me.\" And then I hang up and I continue to cry. Because when you are not okay, and you're crying, and you're alone in your car, you don't want to talk to anyone. You don't want to be comforted. You just want to feel the pain. And then I think about Isaac. I think about him, and how he is going to grow up without a mother. He will have his dad, who is an amazing father. He will have his grandmother, who is the most incredible grandmother in the entire world. But he won't have me. I won't be there to see him graduate from high school, I won't be there to see him graduate from college. I won't be there to see him get married, or to see him become a father. I won't be there to see him get older, and grow up, and discover who he is. I won't be there. And I want to scream to the universe \"Why are you doing this to him?\" \"Why are you doing this to me?\" I want to know why life is so cruel, why it is so unpredictable, why it is so merciless.

This is an illusion. You are none of these things. You are a coward and a bully, with absolutely no redeeming qualities. You've spent the last ten years of your life torturing innocent women, and all you have to show for it is a small stack of newspaper clippings, and a stack of photographs, each one more horrific than the last. Yet you persist, don't you? You keep on doing what you're doing, thinking to yourself that eventually you'll find the one you're looking for. And all of this will be worth it. Well, you won't. You won't find her. And it won't be worth it. But I hope you know that when the time comes, and you're sitting alone in your basement, awaiting the arrival of the police, you will know true terror.

He glanced around, wondering if anyone else could sense it, but no one was paying attention to him. He looked back down at the floor, and followed the trail of blood that had been spilled only hours before. It was difficult to see in the low light, but it was there, all the same. Someone had tried to mop it up, but it had been no use. The blood was still there. He could see the outline of where the body had been, and his stomach twisted at the thought of what had happened. He followed the trail down the corridor, and to the right, toward room 417. He stood outside for a moment, and listened. It was eerily quiet, like a tomb. He pushed open the door, and walked inside, making sure the door closed softly behind him. He took a deep breath, and inhaled the smell of death. It was faint, but still there. He looked around the room, taking in every detail. It was a double, with a small bathroom on one side. The bed on the left was still unmade, and the sheets were smeared with blood. He walked over to the bed, and noticed something protruding from beneath the mattress. He reached down, and pulled it free. It was a wadded up piece of paper. He unfolded it, and read the words scrawled across it. I know who you are. He dropped the paper, and backed away, bumping into something. He turned around, and saw a young woman standing behind him. She was wearing a white mask, with a pink heart in the center. \"You're dead.\" he said. She raised a pistol, and pointed it at him. \"Wrong.\" she said. She pulled the trigger.

He lifted his head, and saw a wall mounted monitor, beeping rhythmically. He tried to sit up, but found that he was strapped down. He struggled to free himself, but was too weak. The pain was immense. He looked down, and saw the cause of it. He was bandaged from his chest to his groin. He tried to speak, but found it difficult. The words came out, slurred. \"What's going on?\" A nurse appeared at his side, and checked the monitor. \"You're going to be fine.\" she said, in a soothing voice. \"You're in the Driscoll Center, just outside of Philadelphia. You were attacked, but we've taken care of you. You'll be fine.\" He tried to speak again, but she interrupted. \"Don't try to talk. It'll make the pain worse. Just rest.\" He closed his eyes, and tried to remember what had happened. He'd been in room 417, and he'd been attacked. That was all he knew. He'd been shot, and now he was here, in a hospital.

It's been over a year since the divorce, and I've been running myself ragged trying to make ends meet while juggling the kids' schedules and keeping the house from falling down around our ears. I've been looking for a housekeeper for months, but every time I get a name I run a background check and find they have some criminal history. I've been really lucky. Mom and Dad have helped out a lot with the kids, but they can't be here all the time. I've finally hired someone, and now she's trying to sue my ex-husband for child support? I tiptoe back into the room and heel-toe it across the carpet. \"Mrs. Green?\" She looks at me over the top of her glasses. \"Yes, dear?\" \"That's not going to happen. My kids need their father. I'm not going to take him to court.\" \"But you need the money!\" \"No, I don't. I'm trying to make it on my own, and I'm not going to have him support me. I am a grown woman, and I can take care of myself. I'm not going to fight with my ex-husband for more money. That will only hurt my children.\" She looks at me like I'm crazy. \"But you need it. You need child support. You need money to support your children.\" I can't believe this woman. \"No, Mrs. Green. I need my children to have a good relationship with their father. I need them to be able to love their dad, and they can't do that if I make them choose. I'm not going to put them in the middle of a fight like that. I'm not going to try to take my kids away from their father, and I'm not going to try to take money from him. He's a great dad, and he's trying to be a great ex-husband. I'm going to be a great ex-wife, and I'm going to show my kids how to have a healthy relationship with the other parent.\" \"But, dear, you're a divorced woman with three kids. You need child support.\" \"No, Mrs. Green. I need my kids to have a healthy relationship with their father. I'm not going to take away their dad.\" \"But you need the money!\" \"No. I need my kids to be able to love their dad.\" She looks at me, stunned. \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Green. I'm afraid you're just not the right fit for my family. I need someone who will support me in my goals for a healthy relationship with my ex-husband.\" \"But, dear, I can help you!\" \"No, Mrs. Green. I'm afraid you just can't. I'll need you to pack your things and be out by the end of the week.\" She shakes her head and mumbles something about crazy women as she packs her bags and leaves. I don't care. She's not the right fit for my family. I'm a single mom. It's just me and my three kids against the world. I need my kids to be able to love their dad, and I'm not going to put them in the middle of a fight. If you're divorced and want to be a good co-parent, here are a few ideas to help you get started. 1. Don't fight in front of your kids. You're in the middle of a fight. You're screaming and yelling and calling each other horrible names. Your kids are sitting there, watching. Stop. Take a breath. Calm down. Think about what you're doing. You're teaching your kids that it's okay to fight with the people they love. You're teaching your kids that it's okay to call the people they love names. You're teaching your kids that relationships are full of hate and anger and abuse. Stop. You're hurting your kids. 2. Don't talk about your ex in front of your kids.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "I'm sitting in the living room with my head buried under a pile of clothes when I hear the conversation going on in the other room."}

You've shown me that no matter how bad my situation may seem, there is always someone who will believe in you, and that's you. You've shown me that I can do anything I set my mind to, and that my mom and I are not alone in this fight against cancer. You've shown me that people from all walks of life can come together and create something so amazing that it can change people's lives forever. You've shown me that sometimes, it's okay to let your guard down and laugh at yourself. You've shown me that sometimes, the best thing you can do is just be you. Thank you so much for always being there for me, for always listening to me, for always pushing me to do my best, for always believing in me, for always being my friend, and for always being there for me. You're truly one of a kind, and I am so lucky to know you and to have you in my life. I miss you so much. I hope to see you again soon. Love, Josh.

{"original_text": "I hurried through the crowd, weaving my path away from the man whose pocket had just found its contents transferred to my possession. I know it sounds like a fancy pickpocket act but it wasn't. There was no sleight of hand, no exchanging of pockets and no picking of pockets. It was an exchange of genders. His wallet became a handbag on my shoulder, the pocket's contents in my hand. I walked away with his identity and the chance of a new life. I had started off this night in a small apartment in the suburbs of a major city, a far cry from the metropolis I found myself in now. I had been on the run from the law for quite some time. It all started when I was a young girl, maybe ten or twelve. I was a happy little girl with blonde hair and blue eyes, skin so fair that I was always covered in freckles. I went to a private school, the daughter of a rich businessman, and I had everything that a child could ask for. I loved horses and soccer, had the best friends in the world and, most of all, I had a wonderful family. My mother was the most wonderful person in the world. She was always doing things for everyone else and putting other people's needs above her own. My father was a hard working man who was never home and always had a new project on the go.

I woke up one morning to find my father sitting at the foot of my bed, his face was red and puffy like he had been crying for hours. \"What happened?\" I asked him, \"Where's mommy?\" He looked down at me and smiled a sad smile, \"Mommy went to heaven.\" \"She went to heaven,\" he repeated, \"That means she can't be with us anymore.\" \"Can't I go to heaven too?\" I asked him, \"I want to be with mommy.\" \"No sweetie, you can't go to heaven just yet,\" he said, \"You have to stay here and watch over daddy and your sister.\" \"Ok,\" I said, \"Can I go visit mommy?\" \"Yes sweetie,\" he said, \"We'll go visit mommy tomorrow.\" He stayed with me for a while, trying to distract me, but he was called away. I think he went to find my sister, it was just the two of us in the house at the time. I was too little to be left home alone. So there I was, just me and a small box that my dad gave me. He said that it was mommy's favorite jewelry and that she wanted me to have it. I went to my room and looked through the box. There was a wedding ring, a couple of necklaces and some earrings. I put on one of the necklaces and went to the mirror to look at myself. I was so happy to see mommy's jewelry on me. Suddenly, I heard a loud crash coming from downstairs. I ran out of my room and headed towards the living room. I was surprised by the smell of smoke and then I realized that the house was on fire. I could hear my sister screaming from somewhere in the house. I ran to find her, pushing past the flames and smashing through the walls that blocked my way. Finally, I found her. She was on the second floor, crying and screaming as she tried to escape the fire. \"Sissy,\" I said, \"It's me, sister, you have to come with me.\" She looked at me and then screamed louder. I tried to take her hand but she wouldn't let me touch her. I had to get her out of the house and I knew that I was the only one who could do it. \"Sissy,\" I said, \"I know you're scared but you have to come with me.\" I grabbed her and pulled her along behind me.

A specially-forged chain of unknown metal is slipped over the dragon's head and off they go, sprinting into the night. Dwarf Brindles do not fly, but rather run at tremendous speeds through the trees and across meadows, splashing through creeks and leaping over fallen logs.

{"original_text": "As long as I can remember, I've been digging holes. And I don't just mean here at Brightwood, in the shade of the solemn oaks; my fascination with earthly excavation has taken place throughout my life. As a child, I had a sandbox that I obsessed over, and a fascination with the earthworms that emerged after a rainfall. When I was a little older, I got a metal detector and was constantly unearthing trinkets and coins in the park across the street from my home. I've always been drawn to the ground, the soil, the dirt. These days, I'm lucky enough to be able to work my own land, and as a result, I can dig as much as my heart desires, and I frequently do. I like to get down and dirty, getting my hands in the soil and removing rocks from the earth. It's not just a hobby; it's a way for me to connect with the earth, to become one with the ground on which I'm walking. This book contains the most useful tips and tricks for digging holes that I've acquired over the years, and I'm sharing them with you now so that you can start digging up your own garden. Why Dig? Before we begin, we should ask ourselves why we're digging in the first place. What will digging up these holes accomplish? Is there a reason to dig, or are we just doing it for fun? While there are a few holes that we could dig for fun, most holes that we're going to be digging in this book are going to be functional. Most holes we dig in the garden are for a reason, whether that's to plant a new tree or shrub, to establish a new garden bed, or to create a new pathway. Whatever the reason may be, there's going to be a purpose for the holes that we dig, and we need to keep that purpose in mind. HOW TO DIG A HOLE Want to know how to dig a hole? The truth is that it's not difficult, but it does require some patience and hard work. And, of course, the right tools. With a few simple pieces of equipment and a lot of effort, you can dig holes that you can be proud of. Here's how to do it. Choose a Place to Dig Before you can get started, you need to decide where you're going to dig. If you're planting a shrub, you need to consider the placement carefully, as you don't want to dig a hole that's too close to the edge of the property or the house, for example. If you're digging a garden bed, you're going to need to consider how much space you're going to need to grow the plants you have in mind. And if you're digging a path, you're going to need to think about the slope of the ground and the route you're going to take. These are all important considerations when choosing where to dig. Clear the Area You can't just start digging if the ground is covered in leaves, or dirt, or rocks, or any other debris. The ground needs to be clear and free of obstructions, so make sure that you clear the area before you begin digging. It might be a good idea to rake the area or to use a trowel to loosen the soil and remove rocks and debris. Get Your Tools If you're digging a hole in the garden, you're going to need a few key pieces of equipment. First, you're going to need a shovel. The most common type of shovel is the square shovel, which is the kind with a flat blade. This is the type of shovel that you should use for most digging, including digging holes in the garden. However, if you're digging a really deep hole, you might want to get a round shovel, which is a shovel with a curved blade. It is best for very deep holes. You're also going to need a pickaxe, which you can use to break up the ground. And if you're digging in clay soil, you're going to need a mattock, which is a tool with a blade that's on one end and a pick on the other. Dig a Big Hole When you're digging a hole, it's important to make sure that it's big enough. If you're planting a small shrub, you don't need to make a gigantic hole.

Billy Mays here, and I've got just what you're looking for!\" \"Palm oil is the single largest source of vegetable oil in the world, in 2012 accounting for about 65 percent of all vegetable oil produced.\" I have found a new love! Its called palm oil. It was just randomly given to me at a local restaurant, and I didn't think much about it at the time. I tried it, I liked it, I moved on. Well, I did some more research into it and found that it is the perfect solution for my questionable cooking habits. My dear wife is not a huge fan of my cooking. She is very supportive in letting me try new things, but she always seems to know when its not going to turn out well. She is a cooking rockstar and when she let's me do the cooking, it always has an element of risk. I have had a lot of success with my vegan mac n' cheese, but other than that, my most common kitchen disasters are roasted veggies, soups, and mashed potatoes. Roasted veggies are a little tricky when I'm using the crock pot. In the crock pot, you have to add a little liquid to the veggies to keep them from burning. This makes my veggies pretty watery. Soups are usually a decent bet, but I tend to make them too thin. Mashed potatoes are a huge issue for me because I have a hard time getting the right consistency. They are either too thick or too thin. My solution: palm oil. Palm oil is a non-hydrogenated vegetable oil that is solid at room temperature and starts to melt around 76 degrees. I have been adding it to my soups to get the perfect consistency. I have also been adding it to my mashed potatoes. This way I can add the right amount of liquid and just let the palm oil handle the rest. It is also great for roasting veggies because you can mix it in the liquid and it will stay solid, then just melt on the veggies.

Billy Mays here, and I've got just what you're looking for!\" \"Palm oil is the single largest source of vegetable oil in the world, in 2012 accounting for about 65 percent of all vegetable oil produced.\" I have found a new love! Its called palm oil. It was just randomly given to me at a local restaurant, and I didn't think much about it at the time. I tried it, I liked it, I moved on. Well, I did some more research into it and found that it is the perfect solution for my questionable cooking habits. My dear wife is not a huge fan of my cooking. She is very supportive in letting me try new things, but she always seems to know when its not going to turn out well. She is a cooking rockstar and when she let's me do the cooking, it always has an element of risk. I have had a lot of success with my vegan mac n' cheese, but other than that, my most common kitchen disasters are roasted veggies, soups, and mashed potatoes. Roasted veggies are a little tricky when I'm using the crock pot. In the crock pot, you have to add a little liquid to the veggies to keep them from burning. This makes my veggies pretty watery. Soups are usually a decent bet, but I tend to make them too thin. Mashed potatoes are a huge issue for me because I have a hard time getting the right consistency. They are either too thick or too thin. My solution: palm oil. Palm oil is a non-hydrogenated vegetable oil that is solid at room temperature and starts to melt around 76 degrees. I have been adding it to my soups to get the perfect consistency. I have also been adding it to my mashed potatoes. This way I can add the right amount of liquid and just let the palm oil handle the rest. It is also great for roasting veggies because you can mix it in the liquid and it will stay solid, then just melt on the veggies. I know that I haven't tried using it on all my cooking projects yet, but I'm excited about the results so far. I'm going to try it in my baking, frying, and probably just about everything else. It is dairy free and can be used in a wide range of cooking applications. Here are some great recipes to get you started with palm oil. I would love to hear your feedback.

{"original_text": "The diner was a warm oasis in the cold, shitty expanse of the nighttime cityscape. Night owl patrons slurp burnt coffee and chew on lukewarm food. A gruff, overweight line cook tosses a greasy cheeseburger to the lone waitress who attempts to avoid getting it all over her uniform. The waitress heaves the plate to the disgruntled man who sits at a table in the back corner. His pale face is illuminated by the light of a flickering television and his brown eyes are fixed on the screen. The TV is playing a loop of a news story about a murder that happened earlier in the day. There are interviews with witnesses and neighbors, police officers and politicians, but the only sound that can be heard is the static and crackle of the flickering screen. The man watches the scene unfold on the screen. Earlier that afternoon, the man's wife left the house to run errands. She never returned. The man had called the police and they were investigating. He was still waiting for news, for answers. The man had been watching the news all day, hoping for some kind of update, some kind of resolution. The man on the screen is being interviewed by a pretty young woman. The man's wife had been friends with this woman and the man recognized her. He looks away from the screen and down at his plate. The woman's voice fills the restaurant. \"How did you feel when you learned that your friend's wife was one of the victims?\" The man takes a bite of the cold french fries and chews. He looks back to the screen and sees his friend's face. The man takes a sip of his coffee and watches as the woman throws her microphone at the man. The screen turns black. The man sighs and turns his attention back to his food. His phone vibrates on the table. The man picks it up and looks at the screen. \"Hi honey! I am so sorry I haven't called you. I just got home from work and I was gonna call you right away. I am so sorry baby. I love you. I'm so sorry...\" The man flips the phone over in his hand and drops it on the floor.

{"original_text": "It was Silvia's and my 2nd anniversary dating together. Despite a really rocky start and some strange moments, things seemed to be going really well. Our interests, temperments, and even our crazy sides matched. We met at an anime convention. She was looking over the latest re-releases of Battle Princess Mintaka. I don't know why, but I felt compelled to strike up a conversation. Well, it was probably the fact she was a fiery red-haired, piercing green eyed, freckled, glasses wearing, anime-interested young woman with a figure that my baser instincts had only theorized could exist. I may have been a goofy, tall and bulky dork..... But..... I have a near encyclopedic knowledge of Battle Princess Mintaka on my side. Fate may have been throwing me a pity softball on this one, but damned if I wasn't going to swing for the fences on it. So..... Two years, a whole host of convention going, and a lot of learning experiences..... We were still together and I didn't see anything stopping us. She got her dissertation together and defended it. With the Ph. D. in hand and some noted papers published, the university couldn't wait for her to apply for some open positions they'd been dying to fill. I was able to pull a few strings to get into the IT department with the help of an old friend who managed to find himself there after a big career change. So..... The next big step I figured was seeing if she wanted to move in with me. I managed to get a ridiculous price on a foreclosure property, and I had been living there for some time. Silvia is practically here all the time and the rent for anything nicer than a single bedroom apartment around this town is ridiculous. So, 2nd anniversery, I figured..... Why not ask? We decided to keep it simple this anniversary. Giving some craziness that happened during the first one, that Silvia still doesn't feel comfortable talking about..... Simpler is better. A nice day trip to some parts of the state we hadn't seen before, lunch at some place we found on the web, going over to the theatre to see the new Deadpool movie (Her suggestion, I love this woman), and dinner at the usual nice place we go to went we need a little fancy dining to bring up our spirits. We are hanging out on the couch. She's curled up with a blanket in my arms. She looks happy and content. Seems like a successful anniversary so far. I was tempted to put off asking her about moving in. I really didn't want to give Murphy's Law a chance to throw everything for a loop. But, hell..... You got ta know sometime right? \"Hey, Silvia?\" \"Yes?\" \"I was thinking..... You are over here a lot anyway, you need a place to stay in the future, and well..... We've been together for two years. If you are comfortable with it, I'd really like to see how we are together, living in the same place.\" Okay. Logical reasoning presented, reason for the question revealed, and option to gracefully back out allowed. Worst case probably, \"No, let's give it some more time.\" Best case: \"Hell yes!\" The sudden slight shudder of Silvia snapping to full consciousness and the odd feeling of the room's energy changing was not in any of the predicted outcomes. Oh shit, I'd somehow hit a critical snag. Silvia slowly pushes herself up and sits upright on the couch. The blanket slips away and she just sits there in uncomfortable contemplation. This is not good. She's normally a very confident and expressive woman. Seeing her this subdued and nervous..... This was shades of the last anniversary right here. I'm not going to allow that to happen again. \"Hey, there's no pressure or anything. I just figured it might be something to think about. I think everything is going great between you and me. I've got a place, you are looking for a place. And there's no one else who I could think of that'd make this place more of a home for the both of us. If it's too much to ask, just say so. And we'll think about it later and A meek and saddened voice creeps from Silvia, \"I want to. sniff I really do. I just- I just- I just don't know if you'd accept me.\" Okay. I'm confused. \"Accept you? Have I not accepted you before? I accept you as you are before me. There's nothing I can think of that \"I'm a demon.\" \"A what?\" \"Demon.\" \"You get a bit difficult some times, but you're hardly a Silvia shoots up from the couch, turns around to me, and holds her arms to the sides with tears in her eyes, \"sniff I'll show you. It's best for the both of us to make it quick.\" The facade fades away. Silvia's long red hair, turns a silvery white. Her skin goes from the freckled pale to a gray with darker gray markings. Two swept back horns anchored in the sides of her forehead appear. But as strange as what has changed is, she still has that same figure, that beautful face, and the piercing green eyes that are more radiant than ever. \"You know me as Silvia Carter. I'm..... I'm..... I'm Silvianistria Nostromandeus of the 3rd Order of Orion..... Former servant and advisor to the Battlemistress and Queen of the 3rd Order of Orion Lady Oriana Nox.\" She looks at me, expecting a certain reaction. I gaze into those same eyes. She's scared. It actually all makes sense to me now. We got A LOT to talk about. And she's not the only one with a few secrets to tell, but first things first. I take her hands into mine and never breaking eye contact with hers. I crack that smirk that she hates to love, \"If you are the same woman that was nearly late to her dissertation defense because of an argument with me about how there is no way that Battle Princess Mintaka could have used the Gauntlet of the Guardian to defeat Lord Izo..... Then you are the same woman I've loved and will always love.\" This isn't the reaction she expected. After a brief moment of confusion, I witness one of the few moments she's ever been delighted to be absolutely wrong. She gracefully collapses into an embrace around my neck, one of her horns glances me in forehead with a light thunk. That'll take some getting used to. We hold each other and eventually start airing out all our laundry. A few hours later...... \"So, that's me. Once an undisputed master advisor, mage, and alchemist to one of the Queens to the Dark Realms. Then Queen Nox decided to listen to that idiot Wester and got her aass royally kicked and banished to realms that even the darkest mages dare not even chart. Out of work and trapped on Earth. Thankfully, certain organizations offered me a chance at a life here on this planet with giving them a bunch of insider info.\" \"I always wondered how they got all that info in those Battle Princess Mintaka books.\" \"Yah, I kind of got into them while trying to see how they portrayed all us on the Dark Realm side.\" \"They were pretty kind with your portrayal.\" \"They still cleaned up the rest of the group. Great gods, most of Queen Nox's crew were complete perverts. I was so glad that Lord Izo got absolutely annihilated by Mintaka. He ran back to the Dark Realms and I haven't heard a thing about him since.\" \"Grr..... Fucker deserved it.\" \"You really don't like that guy. Every time that name gets brought up you ALWAYS emit this aura of spite and ire, that I never sense from you any other time.\" Shit. Well..... she's got me. Let's get all the laundry hanging out. \"There's a reason. And as a bonus, it'll prove you right.\" This has her attention now. I feel her leaning in and her eyes trying to decipher what I was going to say. \"The Gauntlet of the Guardian didn't leave Lord Izo and jump to Mintaka.\" \"Yes. Because the Gauntlet will only jump on its own to someone trying to defend who they love and care for in their time of greatest need.\" \"Yes..... Ah..... Those scars on my body, those weren't from electrical arcs. They were I don't get a chance to complete my sentence before Silvia is reaching under my shirt and feeling the various scarring I got a long time ago. \"Holy shit! These are magical blast burn scars! The residual magic is so weak I could never pick it up while maintaining my illusion and shape change spell. Now, I can sense it all..... By the gods! How did you live through this Silvia hands held my right arm. Her fingertips sweep around. She's finally sensing the residual magic of what was on there. \"You wore the..... THE..... Gauntlet of the Guardian?!\" \"Yes.\" \"The bystander that attempted to save Mintaka and friends in issue 126 where Mintaka finally confronts Lord Izo?\" \"Me.\" \"The gauntlet went to?\" \"Me.\" \"Because WHO were you defending?\" \"My little sister.\" \" ............!!!\" \"Yes.\" I think it'll be a LONG while before I see that degree of shock, confusion, and bewilderment in Silvia's face. And I really hope I'm not the one to cause it next time. I see her bite her lower lip and flash a concerned look my way. \"Do you still want me to come over to your family's place this Thanksgiving? That might be REALLY awkward..... and possibly dangerous.\" \"Don't worry. My sister wasn't good with the sensory powers before, and she hasn't used them in at least ten years. We should be fine.\" \"But, what about Horus her magical cat?!\" \"Don't worry. Horus and I go back. I've helped him out a number of times. He'll keep it quiet.\" Plus, the bastard owes me a big one after nearly getting caught by the magical equivalent of the FBI trying to move his stash of Star Hemp to a new safe place. We both lay on the couch, back to that comfortable and content point again. \"So..... you okay with moving in?\" \"Ha. Yes. I'm actually looking forward to it now.\" \"Cool. Got to admit, it was nice getting everything out there.\" \"No kidding. Strange world we live in. I'm just glad I can finally drop the shape change spell around you.\" \"Speaking of which, you wouldn't happen to have THAT uniform still?\" All I am able to get from Silvia is that evil little grin.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "It was Silvia's and my 2nd anniversary dating together.

I love you.\" The color was almost gone from the neon sign now. It was 11:05 p.m. \"I know,\" she answered, her voice flat. \"I love you too, Dan. But you're going to be late. That's not like you.\" \"I'll call you,\" I told her. \"I'll call you from the convention center.\" \"I'll be here,\" she said. \"I'll be waiting.\" I couldn't see her face anymore. The cab had turned a corner and the neon sign was out of view. I thought about getting out and running back to her. I thought about getting out and never calling her. I thought about jumping in front of the cab and ending it right then and there. I thought about my father and how he'd react to the news. I thought about my father's father, a man I never met. I thought about the names of the people I'd always known and the names of the people I'd never known, and I felt incredibly alone. I closed my eyes. \"Here,\" I said, handing the driver a crumpled wad of cash. \"Keep the change.\" \"God bless you,\" he said. I didn't answer. I couldn't answer. There were no words for what I was feeling. \"God bless you, sir,\" he repeated. I looked out the window. The convention center was still a long way off. I made it to the convention center with five minutes to spare, and the latecomers in the room were grateful for it. My supervisor, Mr. Gordon, was standing at the front of the room, his face long and drawn. There were already twenty men waiting to be heard. They'd been waiting for me, I guessed. \"Thank you for coming,\" Mr. Gordon said. \"My name is James Gordon and I'm the - \" \"Who are you?\" a man interrupted. \"You're not the supervisor.\" Mr. Gordon looked surprised. \"I'm the supervisor. I've been here for four years now.\" \"No you haven't,\" the man insisted. \"The supervisor's name is John. His name is John Smith.\" \"His name is John, but it's not John Smith,\" I said, stepping forward. \"It's John Baker.\" Mr. Gordon looked at me, his eyes wide. \"Are you Dan?\" \"I am.\" \"It's good to have you back,\" he said, smiling. \"It's good to be back.\" I didn't mean it. It wasn't good to be back. It was hell. \"Anyway,\" Mr. Gordon continued. \"As I was saying, my name is James Gordon and I'm the supervisor here. You all know who I am. You've been working with me for a long time now. There's no need to waste time going over things you already know.\" \"We don't know you,\" said the man. \"We don't know you, and we don't know this guy.\" \"I'm Dan,\" I said. \"I'm here to fix you.\" \"I don't need fixing,\" the man said, stepping forward. \"I don't know you,\" Mr. Gordon said. \"I've been coming here for three years,\" the man insisted. \"We've never met.\" \"That's not true!\" \"What's your name?\" Mr. Gordon asked. \"My name is Frank.\" \"Frank,\" Mr. Gordon said, nodding. \"I've never met a Frank. I've never met anyone here before.\" \"How do you know I'm Frank?\" the man asked. \"I don't,\" Mr. Gordon admitted. \"I'm Frank,\" he said. \"My name is Frank!\" \"You look like a Frank,\" I said. The man nodded. \"I am a Frank.\" \"See,\" Mr. Gordon said. \"He is a Frank. He knows he's a Frank.\" \"I'm not a Frank,\" said another man. \"I'm Tom.\" \"Your name is Tom?\" Mr. Gordon asked. \"Your name is Tom?\" \"Yes.\" \"No, it's not.\" \"But I've always been Tom!\" \"You've always been Tom,\" Mr. Gordon", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "The yellow cab pulled into the driveway of my parents' house and I opened the door to see my girlfriend sitting on the living room floor, staring blankly out at me."}

{"original_text": "Awake. That dream. That same dream. Bombs falling. The smell of death and fear in the air everywhere. People crying out for help. The same dream I have had every night since it happened. Four years. Four years. Four years since the war. I sit up in my bed. I take a few deep breaths. I feel my heart pounding. I shake my head, trying to make the dream go away. I can't. It never goes away. I look around my room. I see pictures of my mother and father. They smile down at me. I see my little sister, Betty. She is laughing at something in the picture. I smile at her. I feel better. I look over at my little brother, Luke. His picture is on the wall. He is wearing a policeman's hat. \"He would be so happy to be a policeman,\" I think. Luke was killed in the war. He was only a year old. I don't have any pictures of him without the policeman's hat. I miss him. I stand up and walk to the window. I look outside. It is still dark, but the first signs of light are coming. The village stretches out in front of me. I can see the trees, the meadows, the houses. I can see the smoke rising from the chimneys. I look to the horizon. I see the blue, purple, and gray mountains. Suddenly, I am scared. I remember the bombs falling. The shaking of the ground. The screams of the people. I close my eyes. I cannot stand to see the mountains. I open my eyes again. I am still scared. But I don't turn away. I will never turn away again. I look at the village. I think about the people who live there. My friends. The people of my village. Chapter 2 I hear a knocking on my bedroom door. \"Jack?\" my mother calls. \"Jack, are you awake?\" \"Yes, Mom,\" I answer. The door opens. My mother comes in. She is wearing her coat. \"What's wrong?\" I ask. \"It is time to go to the market, Jack,\" my mother says. \"We need to get there before the market fills up.\" \"Okay,\" I say. \"I'll be down in a minute.\" My mother leaves my room. She closes the door behind her. I lie back down on my bed. I pull the covers over my head. I don't want to go to the market. I don't want to see the people in the village. I don't want to talk to them. I don't want to talk to anyone. I feel sorry for myself. Why did the war have to happen? Why did my brother have to be killed? Why do I have to feel this way? I lie in bed and think about the war. I think about the war, and I feel like crying. But I don't. I am the man of the family now. I can't cry anymore. Chapter 3 My mother is waiting for me downstairs. She is wearing her long wool coat. She has her hat on. \"It's cold out there, Jack,\" she says. \"You better wear your coat.\" I walk to my closet. I take out my long, brown coat. I put it on. My mother smiles. \"It looks good on you,\" she says. \"You look like a man.\" I feel happy. My mother's smile is like the sun coming out from behind the clouds. \"I'm ready,\" I say. \"Okay,\" my mother says. \"Let's go.\" I walk outside. The air is cold, but it does not bother me. I am not afraid to be outside anymore. My mother and I walk down the street. We walk past the houses. We walk past the meadows and the trees. I see the village market in front of us. People are walking toward it. My mother and I walk through the market. The market is full of food from the surrounding farms. I see Mr. Stanley. He is an old friend of my father's. He runs the market. \"Hello, Jack,\" Mr. Stanley says. \"How are you?\" \"Fine,\" I say. \"Fine, thank you.\" \"Good,\" Mr. Stanley says. \"Good.\" \"Hello, Mrs. Pembrim,\" Mr.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "This is the dream I had every night since the war in Iraq started four years ago.

{"original_text": "From birth, criminals were one of two things. Those who indulged in great evils, And those who composed them. Music, more known by its legal name \"erroneus rhythm'or \"treasonous cacophony\" was a music of great joy and great sorrow. To the peoples of the earth it was an abomination, and to the rulers of the earth, it was a tool of political power, and to the ears of the people, it was the sound of the devil. Music was outlawed, but this did not stop the criminals from creating music. For them, it was their only way to express themselves. A funny thing about the criminals, was that they did not always live together, they lived in all the major cities of the world, and sometimes in very strange places. It was for this reason that the government had so much trouble finding them. The government also found that the criminals could not be killed without the music dying with them, and so they did not try to hunt them down. However, the government did a great job of monitoring the criminals, and keeping them from the public eye, for music was a horrific thing to the people. However, the criminals were getting ready to strike back. In every major city of the world, the criminals were beginning to band together, they would have their music, and they would share it with the world. They would use their music to free the people from the oppression of the government, and set the world free to sing. As they began to communicate with one another, a new problem arose. They had to find a way to sing their music without having to deal with the government, and they had to do it quietly, for if the government found out, they would be hunted down, and possibly killed. Therefore, they devised a plan. They would create a series of portals, which were in fact, little black boxes which could be opened only by a special key, and in which one could stand, and have a different version of the music played, or have a new version of the music played, which would send the sound into the minds of the listeners, and this would be done by a special earpiece. The criminals would use these portals to travel to other portals, and create portals where there were none, and create a network of portals, so that they could play their music wherever they were. The problem with this idea was that the government would find out, and the government would then find a way to destroy the portals. However, the criminals had come to the conclusion that this could not be avoided, and they would have to take the risk. A new problem arose, however. How would the criminals know which portal went to which place? They would need a map. So they devised a system of letters, which corresponded to the location of the portal. For instance, they would number the portals, and then they would use the letter system to find the place they needed to go. This was all put into a book, which they called \"the code book.\" The criminals were now ready to play their music, and they would have to be careful, for if they were caught, they would be killed. They also had a code name. They were called \"The Anonymous.\" They had no names, and they were all the same. They were a force of music, and they were the only ones who could play their music. This was their goal. They would soon play their music. The government had a great fear of the Anonymous, and they would do whatever they could to find them. They would use the best technology they had to find the Anonymous, and they would destroy the music.

Why would she even call me? Before I fell and passed out in that lab that Duncan works in, I had problems with girls even the not so pretty ones. I should find out what's going on. \"are you..... here, is everything okay?\" I guess I got chought up with my thoughts longer than I thought. \"Yeah yeah, sorry..... Would you like to grab something to drink?\" \"Yes\" she was even gigling? What is happening? I made a 12 giggle. Through conversation I discovered she was stupid. As hell. I guess it realy is that way. But why not have some fun? Let's try this. \"Where is your place?\" \"Not far from here why?\" \"Well I know how to cook. But I always cook for 3, do you have any friends that can come over?\" it was like she knew exactly what I mean. \"Yeah I'll call her\" Okay really, what is going on? I am not avarage anymore? But I look exactly the same. Is she maybe ugly? But four guys ware checking her out at the bar. I need to find Duncan. Hmmm, I'll do it in the morning. That was mind blowing. I need to do that again sometime. Duncan was at his lab. I explained the situation to him, he looked at me. I never seen that look. He told me to wait in the other room. He was now on his phone for about half an hour or so. What's going on? He came into the room and said:\"just a bit longer I will explain everything later.\" \"okay, it is not like I have anything to do.\" Another 15 minutes passed. When a suit came into the room. \"Follow me please\" So I did, he lead me to his car and showed me in the back. I just glipsed the sign on the car, White shield with eagle, Central Intelligence Agency, CIA. I am fucked."}

{"original_text": "\"What possessed you?\" The words rung through my being, pushing out all other thoughts. \"What need did you have?\" Everyone had gathered, a mixture of fear and anger radiated through their eyes. \"Why would you do such a thing?\" I stood tall, listening to the questions, letting their inquiries drift through my head. I did not answer. I did not move. I stared ahead. \"I don't know,\" I said quietly. \"I don't remember.\" \"Then you are a danger to all of us,\" another woman called. \"We can't have someone who does not know what she is doing.\" \"We must get rid of her,\" said a man to my right. \"We must be rid of her,\" said the woman to my left. \"We must be rid of her,\" came from all around me. I could no longer take their voices. I could no longer hear their words. I could no longer take their stares. I ran. I ran for what felt like hours, sprinting, running, jumping, leaping. Away from the voices, away from their judging eyes. Away from the pain I had inflicted. The jungle seemed to never end. I ran into a huge, empty clearing, the trees towering over me. I stopped, bending at the waist, catching my breath. I took a few more seconds to look around me. I was surrounded by trees, all in different colors, sizes and shapes. It was beautiful. The sun beat down on me, warming my skin and drying the sweat covering my back. The birds sang in the distance, their chirps echoing through the trees. I lifted my head and heard the unmistakable sound of footsteps. I turned around to see a large man approaching me. He was young, well toned and carrying a spear in his right hand. He was wearing a loincloth made of leaves, and his long, dark hair was pulled back into a ponytail. He was beautiful. \"You must leave,\" he said, his voice deep. \"But I didn't mean for it to happen,\" I said, my voice quiet. \"You must leave,\" he repeated. \"You cannot stay here. You are a danger to us.\" \"But I am sorry,\" I said. \"I don't know what came over me.\" \"You must leave,\" he said once more. \"Go. Now.\" \"But I don't want to.\" \"You must.\" I looked up at him, my eyes meeting his. I felt my face grow hot as I looked at him, his clear, blue eyes. His eyes seemed to be reaching out to me, pulling me towards him. I felt like I was in a trance, and I didn't know why. I felt my body lean forward, my arms reaching out to him. My lips parted, and I felt like I was about to say something. \"You must leave,\" he said. \"Go.\" I shook my head, trying to clear the trance I was in. \"I don't want to leave,\" I said. \"You must,\" he said. He took a step towards me, his spear raised. \"I must take you to them. You must leave.\" \"But I don't want to.\" I felt tears form in my eyes, a sob escaping my throat. \"Please. I'm sorry.\" \"You must leave.\" I turned and ran. I ran, faster than I had ever run in my life. I didn't look back, afraid of what I would see. I kept running, the sound of the man and his spear behind me. I had to get away, get away from them, get away from the village, get away from the man. I couldn't go back. I ran into the jungle, the trees a blur, the spear behind me. I kept running, my breath ragged and heavy. I kept running, the sound of the man and his spear getting closer. I kept running, my feet becoming more tired, my body weakening. I felt the spear pierce my back. I fell forward, the spear entering deeper into my body. I looked up, and saw the man standing over me, his spear covered in my blood. \"You must leave,\" he said. I opened my mouth to say something, anything. \"You must leave,\" he said. I closed my mouth, and looked at him. He was beautiful. \"You must leave,\" he said. He took his spear from my body. I closed my eyes. I could no longer feel the pain.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "The voices came from all around me, from the men and women who had gathered, from those who had seen me before, from people who had spoken to me before."}

{"original_text": "For my first thirty sum odd years of existence I never really gave any thought to the notions of God, the supernatural, or even extraterrestrial life. I was the kind of person who had to see something happen right before my eyes to believe that it actually happened. I grew up in a small Alaskan town near the coast that you've probably never heard of. The town was relatively close to a nearby oil rig and it wasn't uncommon to see drifters come and go looking for employment on the rig or one of the many fishing and crabbing vessels. The people in my town were as rough as the strenuous life they lived. Like I said, it wasn't uncommon to meet people from all over the world searching for work. I became friends with many of them and even enemies with a few. However, one drifter in particular left such an impression that he changed the very fundamentals of everything I thought I knew. Larry arrived in our town in late February that year. Earlier that year there was an explosion on the oil rig that was caused by some natural gas or something, I don't really understand how all of that stuff works, and the whole thing was pretty much destroyed but miraculously the crew had survived. I ran a little bar in the town, not much to look at, but it was the only watering hole for 50 miles in every direction. One morning as I was sweeping outside the bar, cleaning up from the night before, a face approached me that I had never seen before which like I said isn't at all uncommon in my town. \"Can I help you?\" I said, \"Sorry to bother you this early, but I'm new in town and recently unemployed.\" He said. \"I was just wondering if maybe you're hiring, I'm not too proud for any job that you could give me.\" I actually wasn't hiring at the moment and to be honest I couldn't really afford to hire anyone else, but I really felt sorry for the guy. \"I guess he can help out bussing tables and bar hopping.\" I thought. The military had also recently moved into the area doing some kind of weather research about 20 miles north, and the soldiers had begun to flock to my place. I figured maybe I could use the extra help. He was a pretty big guy as well, about 6'4 and looked strong as an ox. Every now and then a drifter would come in who thought he was a hard ass so having this guy around to settle a few scores wouldn't hurt either. \"We'll I could use someone to help out around here as a matter of fact.\" \"I can't pay you very much, but I do have an extra room above the bar that you can stay in if you'd like.\" I said. \"That'd be great.\" He said. \"When can I start?\" \"Well first I need to know your name.\" I said. \"Larry\" he said. \"Nice to meet you.\" Larry was a better worker than I had ever imagined. He was hard-working, polite, and the guy never seemed to get tired. All of the regulars loved him and we became pretty good friends too. I decided to take Larry with me to a mechanic that I knew in a town about thirty miles east. My truck's transmission light had been on for a while and I decided to have it looked at. The night before there had been some really heavy snowfall and the roads were in terrible condition. We came around a curve in the road and saw that someone had missed the curve and ran their truck off the road about 50 yards into a healthy pine tree. The truck was completely wrapped around the tree and the tree had fallen on top of the truck as well. We pulled over and ran to the truck as quickly as we could. In the passenger seat we saw and older man slumped to the side and bleeding pretty badly, but he was breathing. The way the truck was wrapped around the base of the tree and the way that the rest of it was on top of the truck there was no way to get the man out. The man was seriously injured and losing blood fast. \"Go back to the truck and close your eyes.\" Larry said in a tone I had never heard before. \"WHAT?!\" \"Do it.\" \"Now.\" He said. Dumbfounded, I reluctantly walked back to the truck, both angry and confused, and did what he said. Well, not completely. I watched. What I saw, I could not believe. Larry walked over to the truck and like you or I might lift a 20 pound dumbbell, he lifted that massive tree trunk off the top of the truck. I was in disbelief. What he did next was even more remarkable. He then proceeded to unwrap the truck from around the tree WITH HIS HANDS. When Larry walked back over to my truck holding the barely breathing man in his arms he could tell by the look on my face that I had not done as he said. After he laid the man in the backseat of my truck he got in on the passenger side of the truck and and with an inexplicable look of almost shame in his eye said, \"forget what you saw, and never speak of it.\" At that point I knew that Larry was unlike anyone else on this planet. Over the next few months feats like this continued to occur. Each time Larry seemed more and more reluctant to perform them. We never spoke of any of them and I could tell in eyes that he appreciated my silence on the subject. Larry began showing up at work In the mornings having not slept the night before. I knew this because he was never at his apartment above the bar. I watched him from my house across the street take off north every night. On foot. To the north there was absolutely nothing but an old, dilapidated road for the next 20 or so miles. Every morning as I was cleaning up from the night before I would see him come walking down that road towards the bar. I still don't know exactly what he was doing or we he was going but I suspected it had something to do with that military research going on up north. I will never forget the last night I saw Larry. A trucker hauling freshly cut timber stopped in to have a few drinks with his buddies that evening. This guy had come in a few times before and he was a real asshole every time. I had recently hired a new waitress and he decided to make it a priority that night to harass her as much as possible. Both Larry and I, were ready to throw this guy out but she told us not to worry and that she had dealt with pricks before and this guy was no different. The next time she went over there the guy decided to grab her ass and that was it. Larry was steaming and looked over at me and I have him the \"throw his ass on the street\" nod. Larry walked over there and said \"Thats enough.\" \"What are you gunna do about it?\" Said the trucker. \"Well then I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\" The guy then took his glass of beer and threw threw it in Larry's face. Larry never budged but, the guy wasn't through yet. He became angry and shoved Larry as hard as he possibly could. Larry didnt move an inch and in fact the guy bounced back off of Larry. Larry then turned around and began to walk off when suddenly a beer can came hurdling in and hit him in the back of the head. Larry walked towards the door and before he went outside gave me a wink that I will never forget. That was the last time I ever saw Larry. However, when we walked outside something unimaginable had unfolded. The truckers truck was 20 feet in the air, impaled by a string of telephone polls. I can not begin to accurately describe what we saw out there. I do know, however, who was responsible. I walked up the short flight of stairs to Larry's apartment and everything was still there but I knew he wouldn't be back. But before I left I noticed above the doorframe someone had carved, more like burned, two letters. It looked like a set of initials and it read C.K.

{"original_text": "It's funny. Being a hitman is nothing like what you see in the movies. No awesome ghillie suit, no barcode tattoo on your bald-ass head. You just have to know how to look normal. Get dressed, walk down the street, sit in a bar. Only after you've killed someone do you get the black suit, the red tie, the fedora. But I don't get those until next week. Today, I'm just another guy in a cheap suit. They told me what to do. They told me what I'd get. In the basement of the church, they told me, \"Kill the man in the pew and the girl behind the counter.\" I didn't question. I didn't ask. I just nodded and said, \"Sure, I can do that.\" They gave me a gun, a real piece of shit. A Glock. It wasn't even a new one, either. It had a serial number and everything. But I didn't complain. And then they gave me a phone. I held it in my hand, waited until they started the countdown from ten. Then I turned it on. I waited for the little chime that told me the phone was on, and I walked outside. I'd been told to walk south. And so I did. After four blocks, I stopped in front of a record store. I went inside and browsed for a few minutes, then I walked back out. I walked south again, this time to a restaurant. I sat down at the bar, ordered a drink, and waited. I watched the people. There were so many of them. All these people, going about their day, not knowing what was going to happen to them in a few minutes. The bartender brought my drink. I sipped it. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be doing, so I just looked around. A few minutes later, a group of teenagers walked in. They were laughing and talking loudly, oblivious to everyone around them. I watched them as they sat down at a booth. The girl with the pink hair was laughing so loud that her friend had to shush her. She looked like a nice girl. She was pretty and thin, with shiny blonde hair. I could tell that she was happy, that she didn't have a care in the world. I wondered if she knew how lucky she was. And then I remembered what I was supposed to do. I finished my drink and stood up, leaving a few dollars on the bar. I thanked the bartender and headed for the door. I'd been told to go south for another block, then turn left. I did that. I turned left, crossed the street, and turned right. I was walking west now. I walked for a few minutes, until I saw the bookstore. I walked in, and went straight to the travel section. I stood there, pretending to browse. I wasn't sure what was supposed to happen. I wondered if I'd already screwed up. Then the pink-haired girl walked into the store. I watched her as she walked around, looking at the different titles. She wasn't even looking at the books. She was just wandering around. I waited until she was a few aisles away from me, then I left. I turned left, went out the front door, and walked away from the bookstore. I walked for several blocks, until I got to the bar. I walked in, and looked around. There weren't many people here. There was a man sitting at a table in the back. I saw him as soon as I walked in. He was bald, with dark eyes. He was staring at a bottle of beer in front of him. He was alone. I went up to the bar and ordered a drink. I turned around and looked at the man. I watched him for a few minutes, but he didn't move. He didn't take his eyes off the bottle in front of him. I finished my drink. I left a few dollars on the bar, and walked out. The girl with the pink hair was at the bar. She was talking to the bartender. They were laughing. The bartender was shaking his head. I walked in. I sat down at the bar, ordered a drink. The bartender brought my drink. I sipped it, and looked around. The girl with the pink hair was gone. I finished my drink, and left.

I felt the small amount of wind resistance causing a small chill on my back. Now there was no wind on my back or feeling of any kind anywhere. I only felt like I was falling. My eyes were still shut as they were when I was pushed out my attic. I opened them for the first time in what felt like a long while. I saw the ceiling of my room.

I lay in my bed for a few more minutes before I slowly get up and go into my bathroom to take a shower. I turn on the water and let it warm up. After it is the perfect temperature, I get in and relax in the warm water. I let my mind wonder about what is going to happen today. After the shower, I dress in a pair of jeans and a dark blue polo. I open my bedroom door and slowly walk downstairs. I look at the clock and see that it is only 10:00 AM. I walk into the kitchen and see my mom standing by the counter. \"Hey honey, are you hungry?\" she asks. \"Um, not really. I might have a snack later though.\" She nods her head. I can tell by the look on her face that she is worried about me. I don't blame her though. I haven't exactly been the most cheerful person lately. \"Well, I was going to go get breakfast. You want anything?\" \"Sure, I'll have two eggs over easy with bacon.\" She nods and writes it down on a sticky note. \"OK, you have a good day at work sweetie.\" \"Bye Mom.\" She walks out the door and I go into my room. I sit on my bed and pick up a picture of me and my father. He was a great guy. Always there for me, and my mom. We were very close. I loved him so much. I was 12 years old when he died. He had been diagnosed with cancer a few months before he passed. He was 45. I was in a daze for a few months. I didn't know what to do without him. I still don't know what to do without him. I lay the picture back on my nightstand and pick up my phone. I check my texts. There is only one. \"Hey Alex, how are you feeling? Love you 3\" I smile at the message. I knew my best friend would be the one to check up on me. \"Hey Nick. I'm feeling pretty good. I miss you so much. I can't wait to see you. Love you.\" I press send and throw my phone on my bed. I walk out of my room and down the hall to the bathroom. I close the door and lock it.

I don't really want to talk to my mom. \"Yeah Mom, I'm just using the bathroom.\" \"Well I was going to use it, but I'll wait.\" \"OK. I'll be out in a minute.\" I finish unbuttoning my shirt and then take it off. I stand there for a minute, looking at my chest. My eyes scan the various scars that cover my chest. I look at the one on my left chest. The one that says \"I'm sorry.\" I look at the one on my right chest. The one that says \"I love you.\" I look at the one on my back. The one that says \"I miss you.\" I grab my shirt and put it back on. I walk out of the bathroom. My mom is sitting on the couch. She looks up at me. \"Alex, I'm glad you're wearing your shirt.

Where in the heavens name have you gone sheriff? First thing I post here, Thanks for reading"}

At first it was a mild irritant and he decided to just ignore it and be neighborly, especially since he hadn't even met the new tenant next door yet. An hour later the entire foundation of his duplex seemed to shake and items on shelves and inside cabinets could be heard crashing down and in some cases falling to the floor. With a slightly startled expression on his face Steve jumped to his feet pausing his game and ran to the wall to bang on it. \"Dude! Settle the hell down over there, I know you just moved in but damnit you're going to break something!\" Suitably justified in his actions and now fired up he stomped back over to his couch with an expression of exasperation and pride for having stood up for himself he went to take a seat and resume playing. This time the entire building seemed to shift and what seemingly sounded like an explosion could be heard through the wall though muffled. But that wasn't the worst of it. The television mount holding his 60-inch high definition plasma TV gave way, and Steve's second most prized possession outside his extensive Blu-Ray porn collection came crashing down and shattered sending plastic and glass housing all over him and his living room. Instantly outraged Steve turned toward the front door of his duplex, his face instantly red and the proverbial thunder clouds starting to form over his head. Slamming the door open and stalking outside to his neighbor's door he began kicking it and banging on it. \"Open up you little shit! Whatever the hell you're doing in there you just knocked my damn TV off the wall! You're going to pay for that if I have to beat it out of you!\" Mid pounding the door opened with a rush and all Steve could clearly see was a small man holding what looked like a ray gun. In an instant Steve had a moment of clarity, and his mouth opened in surprise and regret. Unfortunately in the same instant a blue ray shot out from the gun and enveloped him. It would be the last thing Steve would ever see as his body literally froze from the inside out. Stepping forward the small man pushed his glasses higher up the bridge of his nose and he placed his hand on the now frozen solid Steve and gave him a push. With an audible screech like glass on pavement Steve toppled over and shattered, much like his beloved television had moments before. With a sigh the little man went to step back into his duplex, his free hand already reaching into his pants pocket for his phone. \"Oh dear, I fear I am going to have to move again aren't I?\"", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "First Timer, please be kind!

It's been a while I've talked with you, life gets in the way of myself sometimes. I've been not so hot Josh. I went through a breakup, one that took much longer than it should've. It's been hard, but to he honest, when is pain easy? I keep a straight face and stiff upper lip and tell everyone I'm okay. But that's as useful as a bandaid on a tumor. I live so far from everyone Josh. They're all in good universities and living it up and having a social life and lovers. Meanwhile where did our dream derail? We were supposed to be with them! I know I blame our counselor for not letting us know we needed a class to make up, but I should have been more prudent. I fucked up. I know that my parents and brothers say that it's okay, they were initially disappointed. I was supposed to be a first generation student, the pride of the entire family tree, but my leaf did not survive. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. To my friends, I'm so sorry I couldn't hold my end of the bargain, but please understand. To the girl I crushed on and still do: understand that I'm not the same person. We have so much left to do, and so many things to experience. I still play music, but the tune has changed, just as you have. I may live far from you, but even if our conversations are from a screen, I'm happy. Let's meet soon. To my family and little brothers: Thank you. You are the reason I live. Why I wake up so early to work and learn. So that you guys won't need to in the future. I'm proud of your future, you'll be a great doctor. Your so amazingly smart (except ill whup you in baseball trivia). I can't wait until yall are adults. To my older brother: Words alone will never fully express my gratitude to you. When others wouldn't, you would, at your own expense. You'll meet an amazing woman where we work, just be patient. You'll be a kickass accountant. I'm so glad I can finally begin to repay everything you've done for me and our family. I look up to you man. I hope we can move soon to our own place, so we can rock when we want to. To Joshua: It'll be okay. You and I know that it's hard for us. But you have to keep going. We'll make it, we'll be an amazing engineer. We'll meet a great woman who will love us beyond belief.

I thought back to when we had first decided to take this quest, when we were all together and we had seen the doomed mission of our predecessors, a tear ran down my cheek as I thought of the ones who had died that day. I was snapped back to reality as I saw the camp before us, I was hopeful that all was well, but I knew the reality of the situation. In the distance, I could see that it was already being built, I had seen the blue prints and I had watched as it was slowly built, I had seen it with my own eyes, and it was slowly being built. I had heard the rumors, but I had ignored them, and now I was seeing the evidence with my own eyes. My heart was racing as I heard the noise of the construction, I could see the dark and hulking structure standing in the distance, I had heard the stories, but I had not believed them. This place had always been a myth to me, something I had heard of in campfire stories as a child, but now I was standing here, and I knew this was real. I had heard the stories as a child, but I had never believed them, and I had not believed them until I was standing in this place, and now I had no choice but to believe.

I was not sure why, but I had this compulsion to go inside. I slowly pushed the door open, and took a deep breath as I entered the hut. I immediately felt a chill run down my spine, it was like someone had just breathed on my neck, but there was no one there. My eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness of the hut, and I could see there was a circle of people, with one person in the middle. They were all holding their hands together, and I could see there were candles around the circle, but the flame did not light the room. The only light was the light from the moon, and I could see the silhouette of everyone in the room. The person in the middle was wearing a mask, it was a black mask with a gold stripe down the middle, and I knew this mask was one that had been spoken about in campfire stories. I could not see the face of the person wearing the mask, but I could see a light coming from their hand. This was the light source, and I realized that the light from the candles was coming from the mask, and the person in the middle. I saw that the masked person had a dagger in their hand, and they were staring at it, and the dagger was glowing red. I was frozen in fear, and I could not move, the masked person was staring at the dagger, and then I saw them point it at the person standing to their right. The person took a step back, and the masked person raised the dagger and then the masked person swung it down. The masked person swung the dagger down, and the person next to them was cut, but it was not a normal cut, the person was cut and then the wound was healed. This happened over and over, and I could not look away, I saw the wound heal, and then the masked person swung the dagger, and I could not look away. I was frozen to the spot, I was paralyzed, and I could not move. I watched as the wounds were healed and then sliced open, I could hear the screams of pain, and I could not move.

But this thought so lofty high, was once more, again, broken by the demand for a reply, to the incessant knocking at her door, \" Stop it Mum, don't do that no more! \" nbsp; At last it reached a maddening beat, she flew from her chair on to her feet, leaving behind her old desk seat, spinning empty on the floor. Anger dawning without warning, she threw open her bedroom door, prepared to receive harsh scorning, she instead confronted empty hall and nothing more. nbsp; Seated back in front of glowing screen, reading through her friend's newsfeed, there came again a hammering upon her bedroom door. This time not a moment's waste, she answered knock with untold haste, and with her mother she was faced, standing quietly outside the door, \" Don't stay up so late no more! \" nbsp; \" But mother, I'm just online chatting, \" Susie said, eyelashes batting, \" what's wrong with that thing? What is it that you're scolding for? \" \" I know you're messaging your ex, you're really not all that complex, stay away from drugs and sex or I'll change the wifi password that's for sure, your online friends will see you nevermore. \" - nbsp; [ Here's some other, less rhymey, things I've written ] (https: )"}
{"original_text": "I pulled out my pocket watch, watching the hands tick. Always consistent. Always predictable. Much better than a person. I closed it and returned it to my pocket. I glanced around me. Empty seats. There was no place for me to sit. I tapped my foot on the ground, wondering what to do. I was never one for patience. I found myself looking around for anything to do. A girl walked in front of me and I stopped dead in my tracks. I took a step forward, but she had already moved on. I stood, staring after her. She was in the middle of a crowd of people, but she seemed to stand out. I shook my head. You're just imagining things, I told myself. Still, I continued to watch her. She had long, straight, black hair. The only thing I could see of her face was her eyes. She had on a black hood. A girl walked by, pushing me out of the way. I opened my mouth to protest, but shut it quickly. The other girl had disappeared. I sighed, looking around. I saw her again. This time she was in the opposite direction. I tapped my foot again. I had to get to her. I walked quickly, dodging people. I finally caught up to her. I put my hand on her shoulder. \"Pardon me.\" I said, \"But I'm looking for the store down the road.\" I pointed in the direction I was heading. She didn't say anything. She just kept walking, not even looking at me. I frowned, confused. \"Hey!\" I yelled, running up next to her. \"Why won't you say anything?\" She stopped and turned to face me. She took her hood off. I took a step back. \"You,\" I said, \"You're that girl! The one from the pictures! The one who's supposed to have killed all those people!\" \"Yes,\" she said, \"And you're the one who's supposed to be dead.\" I took a step back, bumping into the wall. She was quicker than I had thought. I grabbed the wall and hoisted myself onto it. She didn't try to stop me. I took a deep breath. \"Okay,\" I said, \"I'm sorry. I'm just...I've never seen someone like you before.\" \"No,\" she said, \"Most people don't. You're the first. The first person who hasn't been scared of me.\" \"Well...You're pretty scary. It's just...I know you're just a normal person. I'm not afraid of you.\" \"Do you have a name?\" I asked. \"You can call me Alice.\" \"I'm Noah.\" I said, hopping down from the wall. \"So why are you out here? Aren't you supposed to be dead?\" \"I'm alive, I promise.\" \"Well, it's just...It's kind of creepy. All those people you killed. They say you murdered your whole family.\" \"Well, of course. Who would believe me if I told them I was alive? They'd lock me up as a murderer.\" \"I'm sure you could find a way to convince them you're telling the truth.\" \"No, I couldn't. You know that.\" She looked down at the ground. \"I'm sorry I killed your family.\" \"Oh, it's not that. I'm an orphan. I never had a family. I've been in the foster system since I was two.\" \"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"What do you want me to do?\" \"Nothing,\" I said, \"I'm not mad. And I'm not afraid. I just wanted to know. I've always been curious. Are you really a killer?\" \"Not really. I can be one if I need to be.\" \"But it's not like you enjoy it.\" \"No, it's not. I'm sorry.\" \"It's fine. You just didn't have a choice.\" \"You know,\" I said, \"I think I can convince people you're alive.\" \"Why? Why would you do that?\" \"Because it's the right thing to do. Plus, it would make things easier for you.\" \"I can't let you do that.\" \"But what if I refuse?\" \"Then I'll follow you around until you do.\" \"Fine, you win.

The nurse with the pills, first one, then two. I remember the soft hands on my forehead, the cool kiss. I remember the words. Don't worry, honey, it'll be all right. Now I'm standing in the hallway of our house. At the end of the hall the front door is open, and I see the trees, the lawn, the street. It's night. I feel weightless, like I'm falling.

But my room is at the other end, and I should have seen it. I step onto the porch. The door shuts behind me. I reach for the knob, but it's gone.

I close my eyes, but the image of his face is gone. I'm still falling. I look around the white room, and see the chair. It's empty. I'm standing, and my feet are no longer gliding.

I'm glued to the bed, and my skin is on fire. \"Don't worry, honey,\" he says. \"It'll be all right.\" I try to scream, but the words come out in a whisper. \"It'll be all right.\" I can't move. I can't breathe. \"Don't worry, honey,\" he says. \"It'll be all right.\" I close my eyes, and I'm still falling.

Do you know how much we get if we bail? Nothing. I prefer him showing up late and getting paid.\" Kyle hunched his shoulders together, making his already thin body smaller than seemed possible. I had to suppress a chuckle. If Kyle got any more wound up his head might pop off. Still, he had a point, being nervous. But it wasn't the client being late that had me nervous. Everything had gone according to plan. Better actually. We were all in and out like ghost: no witnesses, no complications, and no trace. It was a perfect heist. And perfect bothers me. I'm not one of those pretentious \"perfect doesn't exist\" types, but I've never been part of anything that's gone this well. My marriage wasn't perfect. Hell, I blew that one bad. Sure as hell a shitty father. My little girl won't even talk to me on the phone anymore. Now I can't even get a real job. But this job will fix that. After tonight, I get back on my feet.

A smile grew on his face until it reached his eyes. \"I can't stop thinking about what I'm gon na do with my cut.\" He let the silence linger for a moment, hoping it would allow his partners to arrive at the same euphoric realization. \"A quarter mill, each,\" adding emphasis on the last word. \"We don' got our money yet,\" Raul stated with thinly veiled irritation. Raul wouldn't have even bought Kyle with them if he could, but no one could break through firewalls as quick as Kyle. More importantly Kyle was even better at not leaving any digital fingerprints behind. When it came to doing tech quick and clean, Kyle was the best, as long as he didn't have a panic attack. But despite the odds, Kyle kept it together two-hundred and fifty grand had that effect on people. \"No need to shit on my parade Raul. Speaking of which.\" Kyle leapt to his fit with a graceless jolt as he headed off to the restroom. Rauled scowled at his back. \"Just make it quick.\" A period of silence lingered. Normally that would bother me, but Raul was a guy who you hang out with in silence and not feel the impulse to start small talk just to break the silence. It was comfortable, professional even. Which caused his breaking the silence to catch me by surprise. \"What are you gon na spend it on. You're cut I mean.\" I'm going to build the life of a man my daughter can be proud of. I shrugged, \"Probably move to nicer apartment to start with. Maybe start using my powers for good instead of evil.\" Raul smirked. He never laughed. \"Yeah, you'll start shitting rainbows and sunshine will come out you're ass.\" He studied his feet for a moment, then looked up at me. \"You were never really meant for this life,\" he stated. He wasn't being rude or condescending. Just stating a fact. I didn't fit in. I saw something more with my life. I always believe on a way out. Kyle didn't care for one, Raul didn't have a choice. He made too many bad decisions with the wrong people. He stopped believing on a way out a long time ago. Before I could respond, the bathroom door shot open, and Kyle marched out clutching his gut. \"You might not want to go in there. Smells like, well, shit.\" Kyle collapsed back into his chair, still clutching his gut. \"That did not feel good.\" Before Raul could say whatever obscene thought was on his mind, the radio on his belt yelled up at him. \"Yo, got that SUV pullin' in. I think that's our guy,\" said the cheery voice on the radio. \"Got it Ben. Stay up there and keep an eye out,\" Raul stated with obvious relief on his voice. I glanced down at my phone to see it was 12:59. Nope, 1:00 now. \"Got to hand it to this guy, hell of an entrance,\" I said with as much sarcasm I could muster. \"It'll be even better if he comes with the mill' he owes us,\" Raul reminded. The job wasn't over, and Raul didn't let any of us forget it. Ever. The black SUV pulled into the warehouse, obviously, this guy watched way to many movies. But if his money was good, I guess I could let it slide. Still, I guess I should give him some slack. He's giving me a second chance with Julie, even though he doesn't know it. It may not work out, but this man is giving me what I need to gain my daughters respect again. And maybe someday, her love. A man with wearing an jet black suit stepped out of the driver's door. with his all black attire, he would have blended in entirely with the darkness behind him if his shoes didn't shine with the little light that existed. \"You have my crate?\" he asked, monotonously. \"You got our money?\" Raul responded, completely disinterest with everything else. \"First I want to see the product, make sure it's still in the box.\" The coldness of his voice was matched only by the condescesion it carried with it. Raul and I shared an uncomfortable glance. \"You asked us to get the crate. It's still locked and sealed, you can see that easy enough,\" Raul explained, as though one professional to another. \"I don't give a damn what's in it, but I did a job, and now I get paid.\" Even though there was only thirty feet between the client and Raul, it seemed to grow farther than that. This has to go down right, it has to. A few moments existed before the client responded. \"Either you open the chest, and show me whats inside, or I walk away, and you get to keep your bounty.\" A thin smile formed on his face, \"But how long do you think it will take for the cops to track down government property?\" Glancing over at Raul, I immediately saw Raul calculating whether it was worth dumping someplace if we weren't paid. But we had to get paid. I had to get paid. \"Raul,\" I breathed. He snapped his head towards me. I showed weakness in a negotiation, and left us with little choice. He walked over to the wall and pick up a crowbar. I quickly rushed to get the lock open and was able to break through it with a pair of bolt cutters. Raul and Kyle walked over with the crowbars and started pulling up on the metal crate. I watched them eagerly, praying that what we found in the metal box was what our client was looking for. As the lid slowly started to lift, I started getting nauseous. Just nervousness, the next few seconds decided my future. \"It's about to give\" Kyle cheered. Over Kyle's shoulder, I saw a report of our heist, and it showed what we stole: experimental thorium. Despite the muted volume, I could see the reporters lips form a word, no, a sentence. Lethal. We were about to open a crate of radioactive material. WE'RE TRYING TO OPEN IT! \"Wait!\" I tried to warn, but my yell was drowned by the loud metallic pop of the lid breaking its seal. It was then that I felt it. Heat, worming through my flesh, holding every nerve entralled, unable to act on its own. I tried to warn my partners again, but instead of words, vomit came up. It came up again, and again, and again. It quickly changed from vomit to blood. Then to bits of flesh came up with the blood. I collapsed. Looking over at Raul and Kyle, I saw their faces blistered and burned. They got the full brunt of it, they got quick deaths. I envied them for a moment. \"Excellent,\" the client said with his typical monotonous voice. He was wearing a Hazmat suit now. When did he get that on? Why wasn't I paying attention to him? \"It's exactly what I wanted.\" I was breathing heavily, desperately trying to fill what was left of my lungs with air. Every attempt to yell or scream shot burning pain through my throat. \"The client looked over his shoulder. More men were walking towards him from the SUV. \"Wasn't there a fourth man, just outside about a block?\" Under the visor, I could make out the cruel grin of one of the men who had just appeared. \"He's taking a nap, I don't think he's gon na wake up though,\" the man with the cruel grin began to smile, as though impressed with his own wit. \"Good, then seal this up and let's get out of here.\" In those final moments, I watched as the men who killed Ben, Kyle, and Raul, reseal the crate.

Every attempt to yell or scream shot burning pain through my throat. \"The client looked over his shoulder. More men were walking towards him from the SUV. \"Wasn't there a fourth man, just outside about a block?\" Under the visor, I could make out the cruel grin of one of the men who had just appeared. \"He's taking a nap, I don't think he's gon na wake up though,\" the man with the cruel grin began to smile, as though impressed with his own wit. \"Good, then seal this up and let's get out of here.\" In those final moments, I watched as the men who killed Ben, Kyle, and Raul, reseal the crate. Despair gripped me as my now blind eyes tried to cry. My wife was right: I would die on the streets. But Raul was right too. It wasn't where I belonged."}

Christina, who was half-naked, said, \"Father, can I go with my boyfriend to the Ceremony Of The Innocent? I think this will be the best day to tell him the truth that I love him. Please, please, please, Father!\" Christina was sobbing and begging her father. Her father said, \"No! The Ceremony Of The Innocent is not the place to declare your love to someone!

The Innocent will join the 22nd Flying Squadron of the Grand Country of Pures, and they will travel the world to learn about the different cultures.

Christina said, \"My love, my love, my love!\" She ran to him and hugged him. He hugged her back. Christina's boyfriend gave her the rose and said, \"I love you too.\" Christina said, \"Thank you for giving me this rose.\" He said, \"You're welcome.\" Christina said, \"You are my best friend and my lover.

{"original_text": "Announcer Jeremy: Tonight, on The Grand Tour: James is attacked by a Compy. I take a casual off-road drive in a Land Rover. And Richard pees himself. Jeremy: Helloooo Hellooooo, thank you thank you, and welcome to the Grand Tour. Coming to you from Isla Meurta. James: I say doesn't that mean the Island of Death? Jeremy: Yes it does James, but don't think too much about it we've been in worse places. James: Like what, exactly? I saw an actual Dinosaur as we came in on the Engine Helicopter. Four feet and a giant gaping mouth. Hammond: Looked rather like Margaret Thatcher Jeremy: Thank you Richard. No that was a herbivore, and we like herbivores, they don't try to eat us. Richard: Wait hold on how do you know it was a herbivore? You are no expert on dinosaurs sir. In fact you are an expert on nothing. Why are we here? Jeremy: Hammond we are here because your lawyer called the Producers and informed them that you now own this park, and the Producers saw an opportunity. Richard: Wait hold on, I own this now? They didn't tell me that. Jeremy: No they were waiting to see if you got eaten first. James: May I just point out that while the dinosaur we saw when we first landed was in fact a Diplodocus and thus a herbivore, there are signs on this map I've just been handed by the Producers which clearly say Tyrannosaurus Rex pens and Velociraptor Field. These are not..... Jeremy: Yes yes, that's all well and good James, but nobody cares about what you're saying because it's boring. We have been given a challenge. We are to, in a word, survive. We will make our way from this welcome center, through the Raptor fields, past the T-Rex pen, and lastly finish the tour at the exit gates here at the ferry dock. And we will be doing so in these: Richard you'll be driving a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee. James you shall be driving a 1988 Toyota Land Cruiser, and I shall be driving a 2001 Land Rover. Mine of course has more power, because I asked for the most powerful one. James: They all look hideous. Jeremy: Blame Hammond for that, he owns this place now this is his paint scheme. Richard: Wait you can't blame me for this I've just found out I own the place. And don't touch that, that looks expensive to fix. Announcer Jeremy: So we set off on our tour of the island. The Producers gave each of us a flare gun and a package of bear spray, along with a map. James wanted to lead the way but I quickly determined that he was going too slowly so I chose an opportune moment to surge ahead. James: Clarkson you pillock, we have no idea what's ahead of us, slow down! Richard: Yes slow down Jeremy, you might crash into my new park and if you do you're paying for the damages. Jeremy: Hammond if I crash into anything it will just be petrol in a few years so look on the bright side, you've got a future in OPEC! Announcer Jeremy: Everything was going smoothly under my direction when suddenly things took a turn for the worse. James:..... of course this entire park appears to be fabricated from plants and animals that evolved millions of years apart, and could never have existed the same time. That plant over to our right for example is from the Triassic era, while that small dinosaur up ahead would appear to have been from the Tithonian age..... Announcer Richard: James was then attacked by a large number of small dinosaurs. The Toyota was up to the task. James: Get away from me you little bast...... Jeremy: Everything ok back there James? I accidentally bumped a gate open a few minutes ago, I trust everything is progressing normally? James: Clarkson you cock, you've let some dinosaurs out into the wild and they've attacked my truck. My tires have been eaten by some sort of acid. Richard: What do you mean you bumped a gate open Jeremy? If you've damaged my park I'm going to have it taken from your pay. Announcer Jeremy: We progressed through the park, James with a new tire and horribly scarred paint job that actually improved the look of his Toyota. As we approached the Raptor portion of the journey Richard began to show signs of sluggishness. Jeremy: Something wrong with your Jeep Richard? You seem to be falling behind. Richard: No, no nothing wrong with the Jeep. I just keep feeling like we are being watched. James: Of course we're being watched there are cameras all over the place. Richard: No, I think there's something out there. Announcer Jeremy: Hammond was right. His natural instincts as a small animal that survived by sensing when hunters were tracking him were showing through. James: Come on Richard. Everything is behind a fence. Unless Jeremy has broken another gate. Jeremy: I merely grazed that one thank you very much. Richard: Grazed it? Going 50 MPH? Jeremy: Oh cheer up Hammond, look at all this magnificent land, all of it yours. Richard: Not after you get through with it, you're destroying it piece by piece. And what was that noise? Announcer James: That noise was in fact, a Raptor jumping onto the roof of Richards Jeep. James: Wow, what an excellent example of a Velociraptor. Flash it with your high beams Richard. Richard: Ahhhhhhhhhhh Jeremy: Hammond control yourself. The Producers wouldn't send us out here in the wild if they thought we could come to harm. Use your bear spray, I'm sure it will work. Richard: Ahhhh, the cap is broken, the cap is broken. Here we go, and ahhhhOhh god I've sprayed myself. I've sprayed myself. And peed myself if I'm honest. James: It's worked, the bear spray is driving the Raptor away! By Jove Hammond! Announcer Jeremy: Having survived the Raptors and the devious Compys, we now made our way into the dragons den of all lions dens. The Tyrannosaurus Rex pen. All of us were more than willing to proceed past this point in the tour but the Producers insisted. Jeremy:..... And so you see the Land Rover is simply superior to anything else on the road. Look at what we've been through so far. My Land Rover has managed to suffer nothing but a few dents in the bumper. Hammond's Jeep is a mess of urine feces and bear spray, which I'm sure will take forever to clean and the roof is barely holding up. James Land Cruiser is of course the indestructible truck but even it could not escape this tour unscathed. Richard: Jeremy you've gone off the road. Jeremy you're on the wrong path. Jeremy: That's ok, my Land Rover can handle anything. I know what I'm doing, I'm going to race you both to the dock. James: You win Jeremy, come back please. You're headed into the T-Rex pen itself. It's marked off limits. Jeremy: No no, I will have none of your nonsense James May. They could not have a fully grown T-Rex on this island, it's too small. It would starve. My Land Rover can out race anything else on this island, including you're two pitiful excuses for 4x4s. Announcer Richard: And with that we shut up and let him go. We could always find a new co-host. Chris Evans isn't doing anything. Jeremy: I may have erred when I said they couldn't have a full grown T-Rex on this island. Because I am stuck right now in a ditch. A ditch that looks remarkably like a footprint. And I don't know if I can get out of it. Time to switch to sport mode. And now press the fiddly little button, and here we go....no no that didn't do it. I'll have to engage the Terrain Management system and switch it to MudRuts. There we go and..... hahah yes we are free! Britain is gloriously victorious once again! Announcer Jeremy: I shouldn't have been so happy. I might have been out of the ditch but my efforts to gain freedom had been noticed. Jeremy: Oh my god what is that? Must go faster. Land Rover don't fail me now! James: Jeremy scientists estimate that T-Rexs can only reach a top speed of 40 kilometers per hour! You can do it Clarkson! Announcer Richard: As we rounded the last bend to the docks we could see Jeremy in his Land Rover being chased by a T-Rex. Richard: It's almost got you Jeremy, turn hard right! James: Yes, lets see what turns better, a Land Rover or a T-Rex. Clarkson: Now is really not the time James! Announcer James: In fact it was. Clarkson's sharp turn was in fact the difference, and as we boarded the ferry, our cars full of mud and our own biowaste, we couldn't help but thank goodness that dinosaurs couldn't fly. Announcer Jeremy: And on that Bombshell, gooodnight! edit: Thank you all for the kind words. I saw the story right in front of me as soon as I saw the topic. Brilliant suggestion.

But I'm saying that the species of Sulfur is quite uncommon.\" \"Huh?\" Zakka asked. \"I'm not saying the species is uncommon, I'm saying the element Sulfur is rare.\" Zakka stared at Zalg for a second, then scratched his head. \"So that means that these bugs are precious, right? The Sulfur element, I mean.\" Zalg nodded his head. \"Yeah, they are quite rare.\" \"So, what are these bugs called?\" Zakka asked. \"I don't know, but I can find out.\" Zakka walked a few steps over and asked one of the caterpillars, \"What are you called?\" The caterpillar was munching on the grass, and he paused for a second to answer Zakka's question, \"We are called the Zorgs.\" Zakka nodded, \"The Zorgs.\" He walked over to Zalg, \"The Zorgs.\" \"The Zorgs.\" \"So what is it about these Zorgs that you want to know so much?\" Zakka asked. \"Well, I was wondering if they were intelligent enough to be civilized.\" \"How would you tell that?\" \"Well, the more advanced a species is, the more likely they are to have houses.\" \"How do you know they have houses?\" \"That's the only way they can advance.\" \"Hmm. Maybe so. But why do you want to know if they have houses or not?\" Zalg asked. \"Because houses can be used as shelter for us and our family. And we would also want to know if these Zorgs have a civilization, or something like that. And the more advanced the Zorgs are, the more likely they have a society and a civilization.\" \"But if these Zorgs have a civilization, wouldn't they have more advanced technology than we do?\" Zakka thought for a second. \"Yes, they would.\" \"So what do we do?\" Zalg asked. \"Well, we can either leave the planet, or we can try and stay here without them noticing us.\" \"That's the problem. We need to get food, and they are the only ones on this planet that have the food we need. And we can't ask them for food.\" \"What if they help us?\" \"That would be impossible. They have to know that we are their predators, and they will know that we are more powerful than them. They would definitely think that we would eat them, and if they don't think that, they won't be that stupid, will they?\" Zalg smiled a bit. Zakka continued, \"They will think that we would eat them. But they might think that we are smarter than we look and try to trick us into giving them our food, and then they will eat us. They will try to trick us so that we don't eat them.\" \"What if they don't think that we are smarter than we look?\" \"They will. They have to think that. We are much bigger than they are, and they have to think that we are smarter than they look. They are an insect. We are a mammal. They are just stupid bugs, and we are the smarter, more powerful ones. They will think that we are more powerful than them, and they will think that we are smarter than they look.\" Zakka sighed. \"So what do we do?\" \"I don't know. But we can't leave. We can't go back to our old planet, because that planet is gone. And we can't live in this planet without the food we need. We have to find a way to eat these Zorgs without them knowing that we are their predators. And we can't ask them for food.\" Zalg and Zakka were silent for a while. \"So you think that we should live on this planet, but we can't ask them for food?\" \"Yes.

And the more advanced the Zorgs are, the more likely they have a society and a civilization.\" \"But if these Zorgs have a civilization, wouldn't they have more advanced technology than we do?\" Zakka thought for a second. \"Yes, they would.\" \"So what do we do?\" Zalg asked. \"Well, we can either leave the planet, or we can try and stay here without them noticing us.\" \"That's the problem. We need to get food, and they are the only ones on this planet that have the food we need. And we can't ask them for food.\" \"What if they help us?\" \"That would be impossible. They have to know that we are their predators, and they will know that we are more powerful than them. They would definitely think that we would eat them, and if they don't think that, they won't be that stupid, will they?\" Zalg smiled a bit. Zakka continued, \"They will think that we would eat them. But they might think that we are smarter than we look and try to trick us into giving them our food, and then they will eat us. They will try to trick us so that we don't eat them.\" \"What if they don't think that we are smarter than we look?\" \"They will. They have to think that. We are much bigger than they are, and they have to think that we are smarter than they look. They are an insect. We are a mammal. They are just stupid bugs, and we are the smarter, more powerful ones. They will think that we are more powerful than them, and they will think that we are smarter than they look.\" Zakka sighed. \"So what do we do?\" \"I don't know. But we can't leave. We can't go back to our old planet, because that planet is gone. And we can't live in this planet without the food we need. We have to find a way to eat these Zorgs without them knowing that we are their predators. And we can't ask them for food.\" Zalg and Zakka were silent for a while. \"So you think that we should live on this planet, but we can't ask them for food?\" \"Yes. We can't ask them for food.\" \"But we can't leave the planet, because this is the"}

The guard carrying the large bacon cheeseburger walks noticeably slower, seemingly making an effort to make his footsteps gave away the change of pace. Finally arriving at the cell door, the guard holds on to the meal, as if wishing the inmate's request could still be denied. \" Don't tease me like that.

The inmate's smile seemed to fade for a moment, but the usual grin returned almost instantly. \" Yeah, I pity the bastard. Now give me my burger \" The inmate gestures, pointing at the tray the guard was still holding. She drops it on the table and shoves it towards the inmate, fries flying everywhere. With a small sneer, she places the lukewarm soda next to the now disheveled cheeseburger. \" Fine. I hope you choke on it you son of a bitch. Actually, don't \" She tells the inmate. \" Wow \" exclaims the inmate, with an overly dramatic hurt look. \" You are definitely not getting a tip \" he adds, the now insulting smile returning to his face. The exasperated guard turns, ready to leave the inmate to his dinner as he attempts to re build the burger. \" It won't be as good as the ones my mom used to make, that's for sure. Maybe she'll make me some after this .\" The guard stops, surprised. \" I didn't know you were a spiritual man. How convenient \" She responds. \" I am now. Can hurt my chances right? \" \" I guess not .\" They both appear to let their minds wander off for a few seconds. \" We used to have these big family gatherings, with all my brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, grandparents, neighbors... basically anyone that would show up was family for a day.

I didn't know \" asks the guard. The inmate's eyes light up. \" A little sister and brother. My sister, she's the smart one.

I always won of course, but I doubt he'd agree \" \" But you didn't get any visitors \" The guard blurts out, immediately regretting it. She looks like she's about to apologize, but doesn't. The inmate seems to have noticed, and quickly addresses her remark. \" They couldn't come. Told you my sister's smart right? I heard she was in college the last couple years, now has some important job in a firm on the east coast. She's a big shot lawyer now. Not that it would have helped me through .\" The guard's lips twitch, forming a small smile. She stays silent: They both know he's avoiding something. \" You're probably wondering why my brother didn't come \" He mumbles. \" No I- \" \" It's okay \" He says, a bit louder this time. \" The reason he and I fought so much is because we were so similar.

He's seventeen, loves riding his motorcycle, and has the power to control the minds of anyone around him. He lives in one of the big houses on the top of the hill, has a room full of all the gadgets he's invented, and all the clothes he owns are made from cutting-edge nanofiber. I'm fourteen and wear a black jumpsuit all the time. My power is teleportation. It's not as cool as it sounds. I can teleport myself and anyone who touches me.

I also can't go more than a couple hundred yards. We're both what they call a \"special class,\" which means we're Level 5, the highest rank of ability. We're the ones they send out on the most dangerous missions. In fact, the government's only trusted us with Level 5 assignments since we were fourteen. We're not supposed to be doing any of this.

They were much more interested in the particulars of the Ark Project, and in trying to figure out just why it was that the World Government had been so secretive about it.

{"original_text": "\"You ever seen anything like this before Agent Emerson?\" the young Sheriff asked. \"No. Nothing this,\" Emerson paused, \"savage.\" The face of the corpse had been smashed open like a rotten watermelon. They had found the gore covered claw hammer a few feet away from the corpse in the brush. \"This was personal. Help me cut the rest of his shirt away.\" They cut the blood stained shirt that used to be white, off of the body, then placed it into a large plastic evidence bag and sealed it. The Sheriff gasped when he saw the man's bare chest. Faces of women were tattooed across the man's torso. Each portrait perfectly capturing their likeness. Beneath each tattoo was a name. Beth, Amber, Tiffany, Candy, Emily, Karla, Jeanne, Jess. Emerson took photos of the tattoos as he worked his way around the corpse. As he got to the shoulder he realized the arms told a story of their own. A length of chain was tattooed around the bicep, a cheap one use camera, a stained mattress, a ball gag, knives of various sizes, a meat hook. With each photo Emerson took, the pieces began to fall into place. \"How many women are there Sheriff?\" \"Thirty three.\" Damn. More than we had estimated. \"But there's space cleared for at least one more,\" the Sheriff said pointing at a freshly shaven patch of skin. \"Someone fought back. Search the woods there's a survivor!\" Agent Emerson said stepping away from the corpse. Emerson found the trail quickly. Broken twigs and branches led him deeper into the woods. He would have walked past the small brown log cabin tucked into a thick growth of trees if he hadn't heard a low buzzing sound. The old wooden door was slightly ajar, Emerson drew his pistol and pushed inside. The cabin smelled like wet rot and butchered meat. Bile rose in his throat, not because of the smell, but because he knew what it belonged to. Floor boards creaked underneath his feet as he walked toward a closed door on the back wall. With each step the buzzing grew louder. He pressed his shoulder against the door and took a deep breath. Gently he pushed the door open holding his pistol at the ready. A young woman sat in a folding metal chair, tattoo gun held in her hand. \"Miss, I'm Special Agent Emerson. I'm here to help you,\" Emerson said calmly lowering his pistol. She lifted her head, her wide blue eyes met Emerson's, they were a mixture of fear, confusion, and anger. \"Why do I need help?\" she asked genuinely perplexed. Emerson took a cautious step forward and held his hand out for her to take. \"Just come with me please, it's not safe here.\" She nodded, dirty strands of blonde hair fell into her face. \"Where did this come from?\" she asked Emerson turning her arm so he could see it. The large portrait of a man stared at Emerson from the woman's forearm. Although Emerson had never seen the man before he knew exactly who he was. - Thanks for reading!

Worms!\" he said, and threw a handful of the wriggling creatures into his open mouth. Jerrick was not a fan of worms, but he had to eat, so he swallowed them. \"I have to get out of here!\" Jerrick thought, the guard had said he would only be here a day, but it had been several days now. \"You can't just do whatever you want to do!\" the guard yelled, \"You're a prisoner, and you have to do what I say!\" \"Yeah, yeah, whatever!\" Jerrick shouted back. \"You're mouth is about to get you killed!\" the guard warned. \"Oh yeah, how's that?\" Jerrick asked, and the guard began kicking him in the face, not only hard, but also repeatedly. \"Whoa!\" Jerrick thought, \"That's gonna leave a mark!\" He could not see his face, but he was sure it was swelling from the constant beating. Jerrick felt like he had not eaten in days, but he was not very hungry. \"Well, I'm not dead,\" he thought, \"that's a plus.\" The guard came over and yelled \"Hey, you!\" \"Yeah?\" Jerrick said, not moving. \"I heard you the first time,\" Jerrick said. \"That's it!

Suddenly, he felt himself being pulled up, the rope going up with him. \"What's going on?\" Jerrick asked, \"Who's doing this?\" \"Don't worry,\" he heard, \"just relax.\" Jerrick was still dangling from the rope when his feet were grabbed and pulled. \"Ow!\" he cried out. \"What?\" the guard said, \"I was only trying to help you out of the rope!\" \"Why?\" Jerrick asked. \"Because you're not a prisoner anymore!\" the guard said. \"Really?\" Jerrick asked, he was really confused. \"Yep! You're free to go!\" the guard replied. \"Great!\" Jerrick said, and ran away. \"Wait!\" the guard yelled. \"He's gone!\" another guard yelled, \"We've lost him!\" Jerrick ran as fast as he could to a nearby forest and began to run through it. \"I'm free!\" he thought, \"I'm free!\" He ran until he was exhausted, and then stopped for a minute. \"Wow,\" he said, \"I didn't know I was that fast.\" He looked around and saw no one. \"Where am I?\" he asked. \"I don't know!\" he answered.

{"original_text": "I had once been the student of a wise and powerful Caster. He was killed for the locals believed that his power was not natural and that no one should have such power. I had been bound in his home, alone for days as I had watched the locals drag him to his death. I had cried and screamed for them to stop but they just laughed. After I had watched his death I began to gather up his remaining books and notes. I had decided that he had to have some sort of secret that he had not told me about. After years of reading I had discovered one of his secret hiding places. There I found the spell that would allow me to trap his soul in a small gem. After I had managed to trap his soul in the gem I left the small village. I had travelled far and wide looking for a place that I could be safe. That place turned out to be a small town called Hallow Eve. There I stayed for several years, getting to know the locals and their customs. I had also begun to practice the spells that I had found in my masters books. The locals began to fear me for my power and they began to treat me differently. I decided that I would leave again.

{"original_text": "As I left my house for work I felt as if I had forgotten something. Fed the dogs? Check. Turned off the coffee? Check. Locked the door? Check. I assumed everything was fine and headed about my daily commute. It was a particularly sunny walk to the bus stop. As I reached the little pavilion on the corner and took a seat at the bench, I realized my eyes just couldn't take it anymore and the back of my head was throbbing. So strange, I thought, I haven't felt discomfort like this ever..... I started fumbling in my bag for a pair of sunglasses when a total stranger walked up and sat down next to me. As I pulled out the glasses he spoke calmly, \"Light sensitivity? Does your head hurt? Tension in your neck, maybe?\" Puzzled, I responded, \"Uh, yeah. My head hurts a little bit.\" \"Could be a migraine.\" He pulled out two small capsules and handed them to me, \"Take these.\" \"Thanks?\" I took the pills from him and put them in my pocket. \"That'll be 140.\" He demanded. He had a fierce look in his eyes. I stood up and quickly gave the pills back to him, \"Sorry, no thank you. I'm not paying you for anything.\" \"I said,\" He stepped closer to me, \"That'll be 140...\" I backed up but he kept moving closer. The bus was nowhere in sight. The further back I moved the faster he got and he kept demanding money. I turned and started to jog away slightly, feeling completely creeped out, but he stayed in tow. I ran faster and looked behind me but he was still chasing me. As I started to adjust my focus forward again I tripped. My pants tore at the knee where I fell and there was a deep scrape filled with bits of debris. I looked behind me and the man was closing in. My knee ached. Suddenly another man approached me and offered his hand to help me up. I took his hand and explained, \"Oh thank God, that man back there is chasing me, he's demanding my money!\" The second stranger looked down at my knee and pulled a handkerchief from his pocket. He lightly dabbed at the blood and spoke softly, \"That's quite an abrasion you've got there.\" I was confused, did he not care about the other man that was about to reach us, \"Sir, that man back there...\" \"Now, now, now, it'll be ok. We'll get this cleaned up. It'll be 90.\" He grasped my arm firmly. The first man caught up to us. \"I need that 140!\" the first man shouted. The second man released my arm and turned to the first, \"She's in my care now!\" and with that he shoved him back. The first man took a swing at the second and before I knew it they were trying to kill each other. I started hyperventilating, I was sweating, I didn't understand what was happening. While they fought I backed away slowly and then began to run. I turned down an alleyway and crouched behind a dumpster. The feeling of safety couldn't be attained. I started to shiver and cry all at once. What the hell just happened? \"Are you ok, Honey?\" A woman said in a sweet, reassuring voice. I looked up and a very homey, comforting, motherly lady stood before me. \"NO!\" I wailed, sobbing, \"I was just trying to go to work and these men started hounding me for my money and then they were fighting over who was going to get my money and they chased me and I don't know what's going on and I don't feel safe!\" \"Oh, Sweety...\" she cooed in a soothing voice, \"Deep breaths now. I want you to look around. Think of things you can control. You can control your breathing. You can touch the pavement. You can see the sky. You can smell the air. Not to worry dear, you have a strong hold on your reality.\" I felt a little better, I looked up at her and smiled. She reached out her hand and helped me off the ground, then she looked deep into my eyes and said, \"That'll be 300.\" I screamed bloody murder and ran!

{"original_text": "I started with this idea to get to the roots of what it truly means to be a vampire. In the hustle and bustle of the modern life, it is easy to get lost and forget who we truly are and what our purpose in life is. In the case of vampires, we are predators. And at a very fundamental level, we are still animals. The goal of these exercises is to help us reconnect with our animal side. Many people go through their lives asleep. This is a state of being that is not fully aware of the world around them. Vampires have an opportunity to wake up and become fully aware of the world around them. The exercises in this book are meant to help you develop your senses and become more aware of the world around you. In addition to the exercises that are listed, there are two other exercises that were created by other authors that I would like to add here for completeness. They are offered by permission of the authors. Meditation is a common theme in vampire books. It is not a necessary part of becoming a vampire. But it is a useful tool that you can use to help clear your mind and become more aware of the world around you. The easiest way to start meditating is to simply find a comfortable position, close your eyes, and focus on your breathing. Keep your attention on your breath as you inhale and exhale. When your mind wanders away from your breath, simply bring it back to that point. The purpose of meditation is to focus your thoughts. When your mind is clear of all distractions, your senses can focus on the world around you. The key is to find a quiet place to meditate. Meditation can be a very useful tool for clearing your mind and becoming more aware of your surroundings. Lucid dreaming is a technique that you can use to help you become more aware of your environment. The key to lucid dreaming is to learn to recognize the differences between dreams and reality. There are many books available on lucid dreaming. But for our purposes, I will give a brief description of this technique. To start with, when you are in the process of falling asleep, the first thing to do is to determine whether you are dreaming or awake. Start by focusing your attention on your hand. Wiggle your fingers. If you can wiggle your fingers, you are awake. If you are dreaming, you will not be able to wiggle your fingers. Once you have determined that you are dreaming, you will need to keep your mind aware of that fact. The idea is to stay in the dream and to observe the world around you. The key to this exercise is to practice. Keep practicing and you will get better at this. In addition to the exercises that are listed, I will provide a few examples of things you can do to help you become more aware of your environment. Some of the exercises require you to walk. Be aware of the world around you when you walk. Take in the sights and sounds around you. Use all of your senses. One of the biggest complaints I hear from people is that they never have enough time. The idea is to relax and take your time. You do not need to hurry to get anywhere. The idea is to focus your attention on the world around you. Do not be afraid to take your time when you walk. If you are in a hurry, you will never notice the world around you. If you are on a schedule, be sure to allow yourself extra time to complete your journey. The purpose is to enjoy the walk and to allow yourself to notice the world around you. Many people walk through life with their head down. They are oblivious to the world around them. Take a moment to look up and see the world around you. Many people are afraid of heights. This is a natural fear. It is something that has been hardwired into our brains. It is meant to keep us safe from danger. But we need to look past this fear. When you look up, you are looking into the vastness of the world around you. Many people never look up. But take a moment to look up at the sky and see the stars. The stars are our guide to the world around us. The stars can provide us with a direction. But most of all, they are the symbol of our origin. When we look up at the stars, we are reminded of where we came from. When you look up, be sure to take in all of the sights around you. Notice the shapes of the clouds. Many people see shapes in the clouds.

But most of all, they are the symbol of our origin. When we look up at the stars, we are reminded of where we came from. When you look up, be sure to take in all of the sights around you. Notice the shapes of the clouds. Many people see shapes in the clouds. The key is to see the world through the eyes of a child."}
{"original_text": "\"Don't hang up!\" All I could say was \"Okay.\" I obviously wasn't going to hang up. Who does that? Who out there is answering their phones and hanging up immediately? Nobody. But for some reason, he felt the need to repeat the request a few more times. \"All right,\" he said, \"this is going to sound crazy, but don't hang up I'm you. From the future.\" \"Uh huuuuh.\" \"Don't hang up!\" \"Okay.\" \"Here, I'll prove it. Don't hang up. What time is it?\" I checked my watch. \"Six o'clock.\" \"Okay,\" he said. \"You are watching....the news.\" He was, in fact, correct. \"Uh, yeah,\" I said, \"I am. What's the top story gon na be?\" \"Fuck if I know. You're not paying attention.\" Two for two. I decided to trust myself, for now, if only because I had nothing better to do. \"I need you to do something, right now. I need you to do what I say and not ask questions. Our lives are depending on this. Got it?\" \"Yeah, okay.\" \"Good. All right, how much cash do you have on you?\" I ruffled through my pockets for my wallet to find that I had seven dollars exactly. I reported the amount to my future self. \"Good, good,\" he said. \"That should be just enough. Now hurry get on the number ten bus on Fourth and Main. It'll leave in two minutes. Go.\" The area was close enough, but my apartment was on the fourth floor. I ran out and slammed the door, hoping it somehow locked itself. I normally took the elevator, but thankfully I knew where the stairs were; I took them two, three at a time. I burst outside and ran to the corner, and made it to the stop with only seconds to spare. Wheezing, I slid two singles into the fare machine and took an open seat. I was out of shape. \"All right,\" I gasped into the phone. \"I made it.\" No answer. \"Hey, you there?\" \"Oh, yeah, sorry,\" he said, fumbling to respond. \"I was just..... there was a thing.\" \"A thing?\" \"Yeah. Can't tell you about it. Might..... alter the future vortex..... or whatever.\" I grew somewhat skeptical. \"You have no idea what you're talking about, do you?\" \"Give me some credit,\" he said. \"You wouldn't know either way. But trust me, this thing you're doing is important.\" I sighed. What did I have to lose? \"What next?\" I asked. \"What?\" \"Where's my stop?\" \"Oh! Sorry. Right. Yes. Umm..... Fourth and Johnson.\" I pulled the cord and got off the bus. Further directions led me to a small thrift store. \"Aisle three.\" Oh god, what had happened here? It was if a tornado wreaked through leaving behind a trail of chaos and affordable prices. On one shelf sat a set of porcelain dolls, on another a three-armed Spider-man action figure standing proudly amongst several cartons of cigarettes. A jar of bottle caps here, obsolete tower computer there, booster packs of Pokemon card knockoffs strewn amongst rolls of aluminum foil. There was no organization, no order, and no conceivable attribute that all these things could possibly share..... except that each one was labeled with a five-dollar price tag. \"Keep walking forward until you see the red cardigan on your left.\" I did as instructed. The cardigan was easy enough to spot; its bright color stood out like the undercover police officer at my thirteenth birthday party. \"Okay, now what?\" \"Reach behind it and feel around. You're looking for a box that's about five by six inches.\" I pressed the phone against my shoulder with my ear so I could grope around with both hands. After a bit of searching, I wrapped my hands around a box wrapped in tight plastic that felt like the dimensions described to me. \"I think I got it,\" I told him. \"Take it,\" he said.

{"original_text": "\"You ever seen anything like this before Agent Emerson?\" the young Sheriff asked. \"No. Nothing this,\" Emerson paused, \"savage.\" The face of the corpse had been smashed open like a raw pumpkin. The young Sheriff was turning colors like a stricken peacock. \"This is the second one today. We had one last week. And they're all the same. We think. But they're not finding much in these bodies.\" \"I've never seen this kind of killing before.\" \"You're an FBI Agent. You've seen some pretty bad shit I bet.\" Emerson could only nod. He had seen some bad things, but nothing like this. The body had been dragged to the middle of the old railroad bridge that crossed the Rio Grande. The young Sheriff and Agent Emerson stood on the bridge looking over the edge at the corpse. The river wasn't as brown as he had expected. It was flowing hard though. Somewhere downstream, a couple of horses were grazing in a field. A herd of elk moved slowly down the far bank, toward the river. \"They all found the same way, I mean, except the first one.\" \"The first one?\" \"Yeah. He was just lying in the street.\" \"In the street?\" \"Yeah. He was all smashed in, you know, but it looked like he was dropped there, in the street. The others were dragged out here, to the bridge.\" \"What else you got?\" Emerson asked. \"Well, we don't have any prints, and we don't know who they are.\" Emerson noticed the young Sheriff had a sidearm, a Glock, stuck in his belt behind his badge. It was upside down, so Emerson knew the Sheriff couldn't draw it very well. \"We're pretty sure they're locals, but we can't get any prints. And it's like they've all been smashed with a hammer. They're all broken up, you know, real bad. They're just left out in the open, like they're nothing. It's like they're trash.\" \"How many so far?\" \"Four. All men, all found out here, all dead about two weeks.\" \"How long has the killer been killing?\" \"We don't know. We think about two years. We're not real sure. How come the FBI is interested in this?\" \"We're not. The Governor sent us. He's worried.\" \"He's worried? About this?\" \"Yeah. He's worried about bad press, and he's worried about the possibility that a serial killer might move in. He's worried about it moving to another state.\" \"Well, we don't have anything like that going on here. It's all Indians and white folks out here.\" \"What do you think the Sheriff's Department can do to get this guy?\" \"Nothing. We're not set up for that. We're not set up for that kind of thing. We're all volunteers here, and it's a small town. But I think we can get the state police to help us. It's not just that the Governor doesn't want bad press; we don't want bad press either. We're all Native American here, most of us. We don't want the bad press that comes with killing. You know.\" \"What about the reservation?\" \"We're pretty much on our own here. We get federal money to run the Sheriff's Department and that's it. They don't care about the reservation. They don't care about us.\" \"But what about the tribal police?\" \"They're on their own. They work for the tribal government. We work for the state. The tribal government doesn't have any money. All they do is fight with the tribal council. There's no money. No money.\" \"Well, I'd like to take a look at the crime scenes.\" \"That's fine, but you'll have to wait. We're still setting up the first one.\" \"That's fine. I'm going to have a look around town. Maybe I'll have a chat with some folks.\" \"Well, we got a coffee shop where all the locals hang out. You can talk to everybody there.\" \"You got any Indians there?\" \"Some.

{"original_text": "Bubbles had finally done it; he finally managed to become a pledge brother for Alpha Rho Epsilon (better known around campus as APE). Everything about the APE life appealed to him. He loved the social events, the brotherhood, and the parties. He would not have joined any other fraternity. This was his life. Bubbles enjoyed his first year as a pledge brother, working hard to impress his brothers. It was during this time that he was given his nickname; he had a habit of saying \"Bubbles\" as a tagline after almost every statement. All the APEs called him Bubbles, and he was happy to have a nickname. Bubbles looked forward to becoming a full member of the fraternity. Becoming a member of APE is a tough road. You have to work hard at maintaining your grades, your appearance, and your attitude. You have to do everything that your brothers tell you to do, or else you are not worth becoming a brother. You are only worth becoming a brother if you follow the rules. After being a pledge brother for a year, Bubbles was finally initiated. He was a full-fledged brother of APE. The initiation ceremony was a great experience. He remembered the day that he was initiated very well. The whole fraternity was there. The brothers were all wearing black suits and had red ties. The pledges wore white ties. The fraternity recited a poem called \"The APE Way,\" which outlined the values of the fraternity. \"The APE Way is the only way,\" the brothers recited. \"And if you are not living the APE way, then you are not living.\" \"If you are not living the APE way, then you are not living.\" Bubbles loved these words. He felt a sense of pride whenever he recited the poem. After the recitation, the pledges were initiated by being paddled and hazed by the fraternity. Bubbles was very nervous for the initiation; he had heard horror stories about what could happen. But he thought to himself, \"I can do this. I will do this. I will be an APE.\" He thought of his fraternity brothers as family. He saw the pledging process as a way to become a full member of the family. He was no longer a pledge, he was a brother. After the initiation, the brothers and pledges went to the APE house for a party. The APE house was beautiful. The entire fraternity lived in the house. It was a three-story house with large porches and a beautiful yard. The party was in the backyard, which had a pool, and a large banner that read \"APE PARTAAAYYYYYY!\" Bubbles felt happy. He was no longer a pledge. He was now a brother. He was part of the family. He was going to live the APE way. The next year was a great year for Bubbles. He loved his brothers. He loved being a part of the fraternity. He loved being a part of something larger than himself. He loved being an APE. Then something happened. Bubbles stopped loving being an APE. He was told that he was not allowed to be seen with a freshman girl. He was told that he was not allowed to go to parties at other fraternities. He was told that he was not allowed to be seen with a girl who was not his girlfriend. He was told that he was not allowed to do anything that did not coincide with the APE way. He was told that he was not allowed to do anything that his brothers did not approve of. Bubbles started to feel trapped. He started to feel like he did not belong. He started to feel like he had to do everything that his brothers told him to do, or else he would be kicked out. He started to feel like his brothers would never accept him.

You are not supposed to do that. I had a girlfriend. I don't remember her name. I remember how she smelled. Like vanilla, like chocolate, like mint, like herself. We lived together. Where I live now. She doesn't live there, though. Just me. Saturdays we spent together. And everyday we could, but we both worked for the future. Everything for the future. Forward again. I am second in place, of course. I think that the door is there. I remember the door, but not what is behind it. It's blue. The kind of blue where you think it is white. It's reminiscent of those little eggs I would find on the ground. I use to think that the baby bird would soon come out. I now know they never would. My mother would call, sometimes. She would ask how the day was, how the days were, and how the tomorrows would be. It was a pleasant distraction from whatever I was doing. My mother would talk for a long time. She would tell me what my sister was up to. My sister was always up to something. Once, she told me that my father passed away. Back then, it hurt so much. That he had left me like that. Not even saying goodbye. Goodbye was extinct now. Hello was too. It was just me. And those in front of me. The line comes to an end for me. I am first in place. I can not see anyone in front of me. Just the blue door. The doorknob is brass. Doorknobs are usually brass. I could reach out and touch it right now, but I won't. Not yet. It's not my turn. The knock came, long ago. At my door. It was just me at home. My girlfriend lived there still, at that time, but she was not there. I opened the door, and now I am in line. I was not first in place then. I have waited a long line to be first in place. The door unlocks. Everyone in front of me has gone in and disappeared. I do not know if anyone is behind me. I haven't ever turned around. I hesitate. Nobody else has hesitated. But I am me; I am not them. I turn around. Nobody else has turned around. But I am me; I am not them. I see those waiting. They don't see me. Their eyes are vacant and forward. I know they are reliving their life as I have mine. I remember behind that door. I remember because I have been here many times before. I remember the robbery. I remember the gun. I remember I never even got to say goodbye. Now I reach for the doorknob. It's brass, and it's cold outside. But the doorknob is warm. I did not say goodbye. It was time to say hello. Through that door, I would not be me. I would not be them. I would be again, though. Edit: fixed the paragraphs"}

How are you?\" he called out to me. \"Better now.\" I replied. \"Good. I was worried about you.\" \"How could you tell? I always try to hide it when I'm upset.\" \"Easy.\" he laughed. \"I'm your best friend. I know you better than anyone. And even better than that, I know what you're like when you're upset. You're like a lost puppy. You need someone to take you under their wing and help you.\" \"I'm not THAT bad.\" I replied. \"Yes you are. Whenever something happens that upsets you, you always go to me, crying. So I'll just go ahead and tell you this. The reason why I was worried about you was because you had done this several times now, and you haven't once cried to me.\" \"I'm sorry.\" I replied. \"I'm just too embarrassed to cry in front of you.\" \"Its not like that. I'm not saying that you're too tough to cry. I'm just saying that you haven't cried to me because something bad hasn't happened to you. There's only two reasons I can think of that would make you that happy.\" \"The first reason is that you've fallen in love with someone. And the other is that you've fallen in love with me.\" \"I've always known that you've been in love with me. But I just can't imagine you falling in love with me.\" I replied. \"Really? Why can't you imagine that? We're best friends. We know everything about each other. We've been through everything together. What's not to love about me? And you know what the funny thing is?\" he replied. \"What?\" I asked him. \"I'm in love with you too. And I don't mean in a brotherly kind of way. I'm in love with you in the same way that I know you're in love with me.\" \"I know.\" I replied. \"You know? How?\" he asked. \"Its just a feeling I've always had. I've always known that you loved me, even though you've never told me. And I've always loved you too. But I never thought that you'd love me back the same way. I just thought you loved me as a best friend.\" \"I didn't know you loved me.\" he said. \"I didn't know you loved me either.\" I replied. \"Really?\" he asked. \"Why?\" \"Because I never told you.\" I replied. \"You never told me you loved me because you didn't think I loved you. And I never told you I loved you because I didn't think you loved me.\" \"So we've both been too scared to tell the other how we feel?\" \"Yeah. That about sums it up.\" I replied. \"Well, let's fix that right now.\" he said. \"Lets just say that we love each other.\" he replied. \"I love you.\" I said. \"I love you too.\" he replied. \"So, now that we've gotten that out of the way.

You can just do whatever you want for the rest of your life.\" \"Is that what you did?\" Lee asked. \"No,\" I said. \"I did the thing that makes the most sense to me. I tried to live.

One day you wake up to hear that mankind made it to the moon, one day you hear that the new president is the first Black man in history, one day you hear that your favorite boyband is finally getting back together and one day you wake up to hear that the world has lost Michael Jackson. I think I'm still in a bit of shock. As I sit here I can't help but think that it's not really true. I'm still waiting to see a post that says \"Michael Jackson is not dead. I repeat. Michael Jackson is not dead.\" But it is true. And it's really sad. I was never a big Michael Jackson fan. I didn't get to experience his true greatness. I only saw his failures, his mistakes. I only saw the man who had a problem with kids. I only saw the man who couldn't see what was in the mirror. I saw the man who was addicted to plastic surgery and I saw the man who didn't look like a man. But today I see the man who was a part of a band called The Jackson 5. I see the man who started off as a child star and became a star without his family. I see the man who was the only one in the world who could moonwalk and I see the man who changed music forever. But today I see the man who died too young. I see the man who died with only three kids and I see the man who was a father who never got to see his kids grow up. I see the man who inspired the world. This is an amazing and moving post. Thank you for this.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "I woke up this morning to the news that the world has lost one of the greatest entertainers of all time, Michael Jackson.

The Intent to Murder has been approved and is valid from your receipt of this letter today until the 31st of September this year. Please review the FAQ section below about what actions you may take should you wish not be murdered. Please also note that our records indicate that you yourself were approved for a form 839 (y) in November of 2015 against one Rachel Payne, which you carried out on the 26th of that month. As you know, this waives your right to self defense should someone attempt to carry out an 839 (y) against you at any time and you will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law for any unapproved killings. For further information regarding this matter, please see the FAQ below, or visit Frequently Asked Questions I do not want to be murdered, what are my options? Many people do not wish to be murdered and seek to evade the intentions of their murderer. This survival instinct is only human, and should not cause alarm. If you wish to prevent your murder, it is recommended that you file a form 839 (y) against your intended murderer and attempt to face them in a duel. Please note that if you have filed a form 839 (y) at any point in the past, you must wait 6 months after the expiration of that form to file a new 839 (y) against a different individual and 1 year to file a new 839 (y) against an individual you have attempted to murder before. In the event that you have filed a form 839 (y) and successfully dispatched your intended victim, you are no longer eligible to commit murder. Can I hide? While you may hide from a murderer, please be advised that there is nothing preventing an intended murderer with a valid form 839 (y) finding you. Some individuals have attempted to flee to foreign countries, with various degrees of success. However, your travel will be recorded by the State Department in a publicly accessible database.

Please note that extraneous and repeated filing of a form 839 (y) against an individual without significant action towards their demise is considered harassment.

I was a reasonably smart kid. I wasn't a brain, but I wasn't a dummy, either. I was just a kid with a head on my shoulders, and it was the summer of 1962. The day was hot and bright, and I was on my way to buy a comic book. I'd been saving my allowance for a month, and I'd finally scraped together the price of a ten-cent comic. As I walked down the street, I could hear the kids playing hopscotch and jacks and kick-the-can. They were shouting and running and laughing. I didn't pay much attention. I was a reasonably smart kid, but I was a kid, and I didn't know that ten years later, I'd be fighting in Vietnam. I didn't know that three years after that, I'd be married. I didn't know that the future was ten years away, and that I'd be twenty-four years old. I didn't know that one day I'd be a writer, and that I'd be walking down the same street with a woman who'd be carrying my child. I didn't know that the street I was walking down was a street that would be paved over in memory of a dead uncle, or that it would one day be a street that didn't exist. I didn't know that summer that I'd be lying on a bed in a hospital, wondering if I'd ever walk again. I didn't know that one day I'd be standing on a street corner, waiting for the light to change, and that when it changed, I'd be hit by a car. I didn't know that one day, my wife would leave me for another man. I didn't know that one day, I'd be walking down the street, alone, thinking that I'd be alone forever. I didn't know that one day, I'd be walking down the same street, with a woman who wasn't my wife. I didn't know that one day, I'd be walking down the street, and I'd know the names of the trees that lined the sidewalks. I didn't know that one day, I'd be walking down the same street with my father, who would be dead. I didn't know that one day, I'd be walking down the same street with a woman who'd be carrying my child. I didn't know that one day, I'd be walking down the same street with a boy who was me. I didn't know that one day, I'd be a writer, and that I'd be walking down the street, and that a woman I loved would be carrying my child. I didn't know that I'd be walking down the street, and that I'd be happy. I didn't know that I'd ever be happy. I didn't know that I'd be a writer. I didn't know that it was the summer of 1962. I was just a reasonably smart kid, on his way to buy a ten-cent comic book. I opened the door, and stepped inside. The Yellow Assassin It was a hot, humid day, the kind of day when you feel like you've been walking around with your head in a steam bath. As the door to the store closed behind me, I was relieved to feel the cool air on my face. I didn't see him at first. He was standing behind the counter. It was a long counter, and it stretched from the back wall of the store to the front window. There was a rack of comic books on the counter, and a box of candy. He was just standing there, staring at me. He had a gun in his hand. \"G", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "A collection of short stories by some of America's best-known writers, including Raymond Chandler, Tim Powers, Raymond Chandler and Raymond Chandler's Big Sleep."}

{"original_text": "He was a fairly attractive man, at least he looked that way though the haze of the cafe. Libra was at least six feet tall, sported a more-salt-than-pepper haircut, and he had slim, muscular build, despite what the ill-fitting suit looked like. Even from across the room, I could see his nicked ear, proof that he was a hero once. But according to his files, he hadn't been one for a long time. His last confirmed save was before I was even born. I don't know why the Hero's Guild even lets him retain membership, let alone take on sidekicks. I flip through the stack of papers from his file, searching for, I don't know, something. I don't even care if he notices me. We're supposed to meet in two hours, when I'll be officially on duty with him, but I've been watching him all day, hoping that the files were somehow wrong. His strength, speed, durability, all of his stats, average. Mediocre. No rescues in 22 years, no villains or anti-heroes taken down, nothing. When I saw his power was listed as \" Special typing ,\" I had some hope. That was, until he got mugged this morning. Gave the guy his wallet and everything! If I didn't want to be in the Hall so bad, I would have dropped this training program and become a vigilante. Those guys are pretty popular right now. \" You've got ta be kidding, this is stupid. \" I mumbled, my thoughts spilling into words. \" Ulthor, is it?

I guess you know I'm assigned to you. \" Libra had this knowing smile on his face that was already pissing me off. He'd caught me red-handed, studying him, disappointed I was stuck with him, and yet he was wearing a stupid grin. \" Well, Ulthor, let's not lie to each other. Let's be frank. You would prefer that, wouldn't you? \" He leaned forward onto the table, hands clasped together in front of him, still smiling just enough to annoy me. \" You've been looking into me, and I've been looking into you. You're quite talented. I won't deny that. \" Of course I am. I'm the best hero the Academy has seen in years. \" You're no doubt the strongest hero the Academy has seen in a decade. \" I hate this guy. He is so slow. I'm so used to thinking quickly and being two steps ahead that I don't even remember how to move at Libra's speed. Which is, I guess, normal person speed. Human speed. \" You performed excellently in all scenarios given to you at the Academy, which is no surprise since you were five years old for your first save! Color me impressed. \" Color me regretful. Libra finally stopped smiling, settling on a quizzical look. \" I can see on your face that you dislike me. You feel like you've made a mistake choosing me for your mentor after learning about me. Is this true? \" \" I don't know if I'd call it a mistake, I just... \" Thank heavens I can think as quickly as I do, or else this would have been an awkward pause. Oops, too late, it got awkward. \" I just don't know how you're going to teach me to be a hero, is all. \" And there it was, his smile was back. \" Is your goal to make it into the Hall, Ulthor?

Why? \" He signed the check for the coffee and waved bye to the staff in back, who all smiled and waved back. \" I have a different perspective than most other heroes, I think. So I propose this.

{"original_text": "\"Well, damn.\" I said aloud. Of all the banks I had ever come across, this one was by far the hardest to rob. In fact, it seemed to be next to impossible. How did I know this? Because I had been trying to rob it all day, and had yet to get inside. The bank was a very small, very nondescript building, and sat in the middle of a field. If you didn't know it was there, you wouldn't see it. If you did know it was there, you wouldn't know what it was. It wasn't even on the map. I had been hired to rob it, and being a professional, I knew that a job was a job. The client was a wealthy one, and wanted to test my skills. I had spent the last eight hours prowling around the area, looking for a way in. The doors were all locked up tight, and the windows were all tightly sealed, with no visible way of opening them. The roof was surrounded by an iron fence, and the entire building was surrounded by a razor wire fence. I had managed to get into the fenced area once, but the razor wire was no joke. I had decided that was enough for one day. I needed to find a way into that building, or this job would be impossible to complete. The next morning, I was back at the bank. The same three security guards were there. I could see them through the fence. They were still just sitting there, staring out into space. They hadn't moved all day, nor all night. They just sat there, looking at nothing. I watched them for a while, and I knew they had to be robots. They never moved. They never blinked. They never did anything. I needed to get inside. I decided to try the same method I used the previous day. I entered the field at the same spot, and walked a few hundred yards. As I did the previous day, I ran to the fence and leaped, grabbing onto the top. I tugged and pulled, but the fence was not moving. I wrapped my legs around the fence, and tried to shimmy up, but the fence was smooth, and my feet kept slipping. I knew I had to get inside the fenced area, so I could find a way into the bank. As I was climbing the fence, one of the robots turned it's head towards me. The second robot turned it's head towards me. The third robot turned it's head towards me. They all looked at me for a few seconds, and then turned their heads back towards the building. I shuddered. Those robots were creepy. I finished climbing the fence, and dropped to the other side. I got up, and continued my trek towards the bank. I went to the back of the building, and tried the window. It was sealed shut. I tried the door. It was locked. I tried the front of the building. The window was sealed shut. I tried the door. It was locked. I walked around the building again, and saw a small opening near the back. I walked up to it, and looked inside. It was a tiny air vent. I reached into my jacket, and grabbed a small knife. I gently slit the duct tape, and slipped inside. The duct was very tight, and very dirty. I could barely squeeze through.

Oh my god, I haven't seen you in, what has it been 30 years \"Not not Frank, we need to talk..... can I come in?\" I was surprised. Something about my sisters expression sent shivers down my spine. The joyful, blithe, and successful sister who took care of me after our parents were convicted on drug charges was no more. \"Yea, sure.\" She stepped in, closed the door and glanced around at my wasteland of an apartment. I expected her to crack a joke, or rebuke me with her motherly charm but instead, she looked up, and stared straight into my eyes. \"I was the one who killed her.\" For a second, I could hear each rain drop hit my window, the neighbors fucking to Marvin Gaye, kids laughing as they past my room, blood boiling. My voice rose \"What the fuck are you talking about?!\" \"Janice.\" Suddenly I had a flashback to that night. I was awaken by a deafening shriek. A shriek that felt like daggers through my brain. A shriek that, although I didn't know it at the time, was going to obliterate everything I had known and worked for. The shriek was from my wife who, as I sprinted down the steps from the second floor, was already dead by the time I saw her lying in a pool of blood in the kitchen. \"You..... killed her? I don't understand \"Look Frank, I don't have much time, I talk you listen.\" I leaned against the counter and stared blankly at the ground. \"I called your home at around 4 am that night, I knew you were a heavy sleeper so I predicted Janice would pick up the phone before you did. I told her you were having an affair.\" I looked up in udder shock. She continued, \"I ordered her to walk downstairs, unlock the front door, and wait for me so we could talk. I predicted she would do all of this with discretion. I arrived in around 5 minutes and walked in to your kitchen counter. Then, I took out a knife and stabbed her repeatedly,\" she said with a smirk. \"I don't believe what I'm heari \"Then I staged everything to look like you had an extensive alcohol problem, screamed like a scared little girl, then left.\" She took out a cigarette and lit it.

MFW my 18 year old son is an unnamed beneficiary of my trust. And the only reason you have an unnamed trust beneficiary is because you like to pass things off to your kids at 18. Sorry, I'm not a lawyer. I don't know what the rules are. I just know that a house that I was living in burned down and a trust was set up to pay for the house to be rebuilt and an attorney was brought in to do the paperwork. It was a no brainer for me. I had no cash and I'm not the legal type. I just knew that I didn't want my parents to have to take out a loan to rebuild the house that I was living in. I had a little bit of savings and could have just put it all into the new house. But the attorney explained that this way I didn't have to pay the taxes on the money and it could all be applied to the house. I know there are drawbacks to a trust and there are different kinds of trusts. But I don't know the first thing about them. It was something my parents did and I just went with it. A trust is a great tool for keeping assets safe from creditors. It is an estate planning tool. Now the definition of a \"grantor trust\" will have to be changed by the IRS. A grantor trust is created when a person places assets under the control of a trustee for the benefit of that person andor others. A grantor trust is not considered to be a separate taxpayer. Instead, the income, deductions, gains and losses of the trust are considered to be those of the person who established the trust. How does this impact me? Well, it seems to be an unintended consequence. It will be very easy for a wealthy person to transfer a lot of assets into an 18 year old kid's name and not have to pay capital gains when it sells. This is a HUGE tax break for the wealthy. How does this help a poor guy like me? Well, I suppose I could transfer the title of my house and a couple of my cars to my 18 year old son. But I still have to pay the mortgage and insurance on it, so I'm not sure what the benefit is. It seems like it is just a paperwork burden that doesn't provide any real benefit. I am sorry about your house but there are things that you can do. I have a TON of money (not even close) in my trust. My kids own everything that I own. I had a great attorney set it all up. I have 6 properties in my trust. My attorney has the papers for the properties and I have nothing but the keys. The attorney put them into a trust and the trusts are named after my kids. If I die, the properties go to the trust and my kids. If I sell a property, the money goes into the trust and the kids own it. If I sell a property and then the kids sell it, they will pay the capital gains tax and I will not. If I die and the kids sell the property, they will pay the capital gains tax and I will not. I think you are correct. If you were to sell a property (or transfer it to your 18 year old kid) there would be a capital gains tax. I'm not sure what the capital gains tax is on real estate. But if you were to sell stock, you'd have to pay capital gains tax on the sale. But if you transfer it to your 18 year old kid, there would be no capital gains tax because the kid would get a step up in basis.

{"original_text": "Volunteers for the LUMO-DX Mk.III had to undergo a rigorous schedule of screenings - both physical and psychological. Over three-hundred candidates, from any background one can name, stepped forward for the honor. In the end, the pool was whittled down to five: a plumber, a nurse, a construction worker, a grocer, and a locksmith. All five were given the opportunity to pilot the newest LUMO-DX model. Unfortunately, only two responded in time to secure a slot. Thus, the pilot program was set to begin with only the plumber and the nurse. The nurse was the first to take her place in the pilot's seat, and the first to feel the initial thrill of the new warp drive. She and the plumber were equally matched in their skill, but it was the nurse who was first to see combat. The plumber, in the cockpit of his own LUMO-DX Mk.III, was helping the nurse learn how to make the most of the new weaponry. As they strafed a group of enemy commandos, a rocket slammed into the cockpit of the nurse's craft. The blast flung her unconscious body into the void beyond the craft. Her helmetless head struck the edge of a nearby rock, and her life was extinguished. The plumber, having witnessed the event, quickly set to work. He scoured the area, gathering up the fallen nurse's equipment and body. He then used his own LUMO-DX to slingshot himself back to the safe harbor of the hospital ship. The bodies of the nurse and her craft were then transferred to a special hearse unit, which was set to return to the hospital ship on a more leisurely schedule. The plumber remained on the front lines, battling fiercely in his LUMO-DX Mk.III. When the enemy called for a cease-fire, the plumber was the last one to lay down his weapons. His single-minded determination to fight for his people ensured that no harm would come to them, and that their future would be bright. After the war, the plumber was awarded the Order of the Golden Star, given to any citizen of the Protectorate who does the greatest service to the state. The plumber was able to perform this service thanks to the LUMO-DX Mk.III. Continuing the trend established by the previous models, the LUMO-DX Mk.III is a powerhouse of a ship. Its top speed is a staggering 272.5 kms, and it can accelerate from 0 to 100 kms in a mere 5.35 seconds. In addition, it is very maneuverable. However, its sheer power and bulk makes it very expensive, and it is capable of carrying very little equipment. The LUMO-DX Mk.III is based on the structure of the BLACK-DX Mk.III, with a few minor changes made to the design. It is a very bulky craft, and it has a large number of engines. It has a large amount of armor, but it is quite difficult to get to. Its weapon mounts are also well-armored, but they can be protected by the new forward-facing shields. The LUMO-DX Mk.III's engines have been modified to allow for both an enormous top speed and a surprising degree of maneuverability. The LUMO-DX Mk.III is a very expensive craft, and it cannot be customized by its owner. It can be obtained by purchasing it at the X-Shop, or by purchasing the LUMO-DX Mk.III Pack.

He could tell none of this was real, he'd grown up in real forests, and they were full of the sounds of wind, wildlife, everything had some rhyme or reason for making the sound it did. This place? Even the river didn't make the right sound. It's like they turned the volume of everything down in intensity. It felt unnatural. It made him shiver. \"Outside this place, I could make fire, you know,\" Frank mumbled. \"I once accidentally burned my house down when I was a kid.

Last week he could've pinpointed a squirrel a mile away, but somehow in this place he couldn't get his hearing to work right. Must have been the food. \"Wait, what were you saying?\" he whispered suddenly, and locked eyes with Frank. \"I thought you wanted me to shut up.\" \"SHH! Fucking..... just whisper, Frank. For me. I can hear someone out there. They probably can't hear us, but just keep quiet, alright? Now, what were you saying?\" \"Fine.\" Frank whispered, with a roll of his eyes. \"I was just SAYING, outside this place I can make fire. On anything. I lit spent matches on fire once. In here, all I can do is heat water. I don't know, it's like this place is messing with my heat.\" That explained it.'The dome must suppress people's powers,' Bobby thought.'Probably to equalize the chances a bit.

Shit, maybe it's Ace, he's always been kind of a big lumbering beast.\" Suddenly, and sure enough, Ace burst from the brush on the other side of the river and rushed into the water, dunking his head and taking long, deep gulps. It didn't seem like he'd spotted them. Just then, something clicked in Bobby's head. \"Frank. Get down from the tree. Ace is in the water. I think if you try hard enough, you can cook him.\" \"What?\" \"We're in here to kill, Frank. I did my job, I spotted someone. Now go do yours.\" \"What? What? My job is to cook the food, Bobby! You're the fighting expert, YOU go down there!\" Frank whispered furtively. Bobby grabbed him by the collar. \"Stick. Your hands. In the river. Cook it up like you were cooking noodles. You said you can heat water, right?\" \"I mean, I think! I don't know the specifics, man. I've tried it on everything and if it's got water in it, I can get it warm. The noodles only work because there's more water than noodles in the pot, but that's a lot of water man. That's a river.\" \"Listen, Ace has super strength, not fucking super vision or hearing or anything. He'll never see you coming. This place is surely messing with him the same way it's messing with us. He's probably weaker now. If you surprise him, maybe we can knock him off the list!\" Frank thought for a second. \"Fine. Worth a shot. I'm a dead man, anyway.\" He climbed down from the tree as quietly as he could and crept to the edge of the bushes on the riverbank. His heart was pounding, he'd never killed before, but what choice did he have? He might even have to kill Bobby if someone else didn't get to him first. He'd been chosen at random, he never had a taste for violence, just fire. His palms started sweating, and without thinking he heated them. A flash of steam rose from the bush he was hiding in, and he cursed quietly. Ace took notice of the movement and squinted in Franks direction, then dove in and started racing across the river, with the incredible speed of a super strong fucking dolphin or something! Frank panicked and burst out towards the water, hands extended. Ace was almost across, if Frank didn't try something now, he'd surely be broken in two. He'd seen it, from a distance. Ace had literally pulled one of the other contestants apart. It was sickening. He got to the rivers edge just as Ace was surfacing only a few feet away, murder in his eyes, grinning like death. Frank stuck his hands in the river, turned his heat up as high as he could, and a flash of white enveloped them both.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "\"Ding!\" \"Why do you always say that? You don't have to say that. It's annoying.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"That'ding' thing you always say when the foods done. Listen, I get it, you can create heat with the palms of your hands. Not enough to light a fire, fucking SOMEHOW, but enough to cook up our food fairly quickly. Congratulations. You're useless. Just do your job, get me fucking fed, and enough with the'ding' alright?\" \"It's a reflex, Bobby, I can't help it. Sort of like a sneeze. You know what happens when you try to suppress a sneeze? Your EYES pop out, Bobby. I like my eyes.\" \"Who gives a SHIT about your eyes, Frank? FUCKING. FRANK EVERYONE IN HERE WILL DIE. Shit, only one person is going to walk out of this place alive. You realize that if it's down to you and me, I'll have no choice but to kill you, right? Fuck, why am I even talking to you, you're useless.\" Bobby leaned back on his tree branch, eyes scanning the river bank below. He focused on the sounds of the forest. He could tell none of this was real, he'd grown up in real forests, and they were full of the sounds of wind, wildlife, everything had some rhyme or reason for making the sound it did. This place? Even the river didn't make the right sound. It's like they turned the volume of everything down in intensity. It felt unnatural. It made him shiver. \"Outside this place, I could make fire, you know,\" Frank mumbled. \"I once accidentally burned my house down when I was a kid. I was holding a bunch of spent matchsticks that I'd been playing with earlier, and then suddenly they all just burst int Bobby put his finger up to Franks lips. He mouthed'shh' and focused. The sound had changed. It was faint, but he could hear someone moving through the brush somewhere across the river. Last week he could've pinpointed a squirrel a mile away, but somehow in this place he couldn't get his hearing to work right. Must have been the food. \"Wait, what were you saying?\" he whispered suddenly, and locked eyes with Frank. \"I thought you wanted me to shut up.\" \"SHH! Fucking..... just whisper, Frank. For me. I can hear someone out there. They probably can't hear us, but just keep quiet, alright? Now, what were you saying?\" \"Fine.\" Frank whispered, with a roll of his eyes. \"I was just SAYING, outside this place I can make fire. On anything. I lit spent matches on fire once. In here, all I can do is heat water. I don't know, it's like this place is messing with my heat.\" That explained it.'The dome must suppress people's powers,' Bobby thought.'Probably to equalize the chances a bit.

{"original_text": "First of all, I want to make something perfectly clear. If you read nothing else in this letter, if you crumple it up and throw it away, read this line: OVER THE LONG TERM, PROFITS ARE DRIVEN BY THE TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL OF YOUR INVESTMENTS. It's a basic idea. If you put 100,000 in the bank at 4, you'll earn 4,000 in interest. In order to earn a 10,000 profit, you have to have an extra 3,000 in the bank. That's a 3 total return on your capital. This idea is basic to our investing philosophy, and it's a simple way to judge the health of your investment program. It's also one of the most important concepts I'll share with you. You've probably heard the old saying, \"Money makes money.\" That's true. But you can also think of it as: \"Over the long term, profits are driven by the total return on capital of your investments.\" It's the law of compounding interest. Compounding interest is when you earn interest on interest. This is how wealth is created. Compounding interest is the reason you can start with a single grain of rice on a chessboard and end up with more rice than there is in the world. It's also the reason why money you invest will grow exponentially over time. How to Grow Your Money How much money would you have at the end of 10 years if you put 100,000 into the bank at 4 interest? If you said 144,000, you'd be close. But you'd be missing a crucial point. In the first year, you'd earn 4,000 in interest. But that interest is added to your original 100,000. So the next year, you'd earn 4 of 104,000. In the third year, you'd earn 4 of 108,160. After 10 years, you would have a total of 163,640. And if you continued to earn 4 for another 10 years, you'd end up with 230,750. You started with 100,000. And 20 years later, you have 230,000 - or a total return of 130,000. Let's say you wanted to grow that money to 300,000. How much more would you need to earn? It's not as easy a question as you might think. For starters, you'd need to earn a higher rate of interest. But to earn more money, you need to earn more money. If you simply invested 100,000 at 6 interest, after 20 years you'd have 208,000 - or a total return of 108,000. But to grow your money to 300,000, you'd need a total return of 200,000. So how do you get that extra 92,000? You can't. What you can do is find ways to earn more than 6. By earning 8 on your 100,000 investment, you'd have a total return of 255,000 after 20 years. That's enough to reach 300,000. But if you wanted to reach 500,000, you'd need to earn a total return of 400,000. And to earn 400,000, you'd have to earn 10 on 100,000. So what you want to do is find investments that will earn you 10 (or more). And that's what we'll do together.

{"original_text": "30 years in this business, and I've had enough. I've ended thousands of lives in that span. Some have deserved their fate, some probably haven't, and three were accidents, my fault. But this last one, this last one is a mistake that has shaken me, and I'm not sure I can do this anymore. I've been hired by a very rich woman, who wished to end her husband's life. It was an easy job; she wanted me to make it look like an accident, so I made his heart stop beating with a simple poison dart, and then made his car swerve off the road. The police said that the drug I put in his system was very similar to ecstasy, but was much more potent, so when it hit his system, it made him lose control of his motor functions. I thought it was a good job, so I asked for the money, and she handed me an envelope that had twenty million in it. I was going to pay off my debts, and then I was going to retire. I'd take a vacation to Italy, then move to Japan and live out the rest of my days as a reclusive writer. I'd probably write a book about my life and the other people I've killed, but I'd write it anonymously, and just call it a work of fiction. So I left that house, and as I'm walking out the door, I hear a strange noise. I turn around, and the woman is on the ground, she's choking, and I can see the dart sticking out of her. I ran up to her, and pulled it out of her arm. She was dying, she had minutes to live. I had to do something, but I didn't know what. She looked up at me with her dying eyes, and whispered something that I couldn't hear. I brought my ear down to her mouth and listened closely, and she whispered, \"Make it look like an accident.\" I don't know why, but I thought she meant her husband's death, but I was wrong. She meant hers. I could have just let her die, and called the ambulance, but I didn't. I ran out the door, and found her husband's car. I checked the car's file, and it was similar to his wife's, but it was also a convertible. I got in the car, started it, and put it in reverse. I sped down the street, until I came to a stop sign. There was another car coming from the other direction, so I stopped, but instead of waiting for it to pass, I put my foot down on the gas pedal, and went through the intersection. I slammed right into the other car, and the airbags deployed, throwing me into the steering wheel. I fell out of the car, and the other driver stumbled out of his. He asked me if I was okay, and I lied and said I was. He asked me what happened, and I said I didn't know. I drove through the stop sign and slammed into him, and his car rolled over. I asked him if he was alright, and he said he was. He said he was fine, and walked away, but I watched him as he did. He was limping, and I knew that he wasn't fine. I knew that he had broken something, and that he was in pain. I got up, and went back to the woman's house. I went inside, and found the woman's dead body on the floor. I didn't know what to do, so I just left. I left her there, and I left her house. I took a plane to Chicago, and stayed there for a couple of days. I needed to be away from that place, so I left, and I stayed away for as long as I could. I was hoping that I would forget, but I haven't. I remember everything. I remember the limping man, and how his car rolled over and he was screaming in pain. I remember the look in the woman's eyes as she died, and I remember the limp in the man's leg as he walked away from the accident. I can't do this anymore, I don't have the stomach for it anymore. I'm done with this business, and if anyone has a problem with it, then I will deal with them in my own way. I'm done with killing. I'm done with everything. The last line was epic...that made me remember something, but I can't remember what.

{"original_text": "I closed the book at page 767, only a couple of pages until the end. I listened to the descending footsteps, my wife's, fall with a methodical rhythm. I had heard it before. It was the rhythm of her steps when she came up to the bedroom to get something, in the morning or the evening. I'm the sort of person who, when he finishes a book, likes to close it and leave it for a while. I'm not one of those who, as soon as he has finished reading, has to pick up the next book. I like to let the books I read settle inside me. I like to let the words flow around in my mind. I don't need to do that with every book. Only with the ones that are more important to me. I'd only finished reading the book a few minutes earlier. I had been reading it since the beginning of the summer. I hadn't read it every day, but I had read it regularly. I had read it in the car, on the beach, in the mountains, in the hotel, in the bedroom. I listened to my wife's steps. They were regular, measured. I imagined her in the hallway, at the top of the stairs, her long hair down to her waist, her slender figure. I imagined her standing still, looking around, looking for something. It was an everyday gesture. She was looking for something that had to be on the table, on the chair, in the drawer, on the bedside table. It was something that she didn't know where to look for, or it was something that she was sure she had lost. And she would find it, or else she would lose it forever. But that's how it is. Things are like that. I heard the steps on the stairs. I closed my eyes and heard them, as if my mind were a camera, as if my eyes were the lens, and I were seeing her from above, in close-up. The lens was slowly zooming out, so that I could see her from above. I could see the staircase, the landing, the hallway. I could see the living room, the sofa, the coffee table, the rug. I could see the terrace, the garden, the trees. I could see the whole house. And I could see the street, the street with its cars parked along both sides, the cars that people drove every day to go to work. I could see the whole street. I could see the people walking along the sidewalk, the people who walked every day on their way to work. They walked along the sidewalk, they crossed the street, they stopped at the traffic light, they waited for it to turn green. They walked slowly, but they got there. They were getting close to the end. They were getting closer to the end of the day, to the end of their journey, to the end of the street. They were getting closer to the end of the sidewalk, to the end of the traffic light, to the end of the cars parked along the street. They were getting closer to the end of the work day, to the end of the week. They were getting closer to the end of the year. They were getting closer to the end of their life. They were getting closer to the end of the world. They were getting closer to the end of the universe. They were getting closer to the end of everything. I imagined them as they walked along the sidewalk, as they crossed the street, as they waited for the traffic light to turn green. I imagined them as they got closer to the end of the world, to the end of the universe, to the end of everything. I imagined them as they got closer to the end of their life. I imagined them as they got closer to the end of their death. I imagined the whole world getting closer to the end of its life, to the end of its death. I imagined the whole world getting closer to the end of everything. I imagined the whole world getting closer to the end of the book. To the end of this book. To the end of this book that had closed down my mind for a moment, that had stopped my thoughts. I opened my eyes. I opened them slowly, as if I were a machine, as if I were a robot, as if I were a toy. I was a toy. I was a toy that my wife had made. She had made me to be the man she wanted.

{"original_text": "My feet hurt, my eyelids grew heavy from lack of rest, and my unshaven beard is long enough to be feared at this point. The only thing I had eaten today was a salami sandwich, and my backpack was stuffed with books. I walked along the frontage road of a major highway, weaving in and out of a maze of gas stations, fast-food joints, and convenience stores. The route on my phone was not always clear, and I became confused in the myriad of exits and entrances, but I always found my way. Every time I crossed a street, I was scared of being hit by a car. The highway was loud. It felt as if I was walking on the edge of the world. I came to a chain-link fence and looked at the map on my phone to see that I had to go through a cemetery to get to my destination. I walked through the graveyard, passed by a crumbling mausoleum, and found a small overgrown trail leading to the back. I followed it and found a small, abandoned, single-room schoolhouse. I had found my way to \"the schoolhouse,\" which was where I was scheduled to read tonight. \"The schoolhouse\" was the brainchild of a group of poets and writers who live in and around Athens, Ohio. The idea was to turn an abandoned schoolhouse into a venue for readings, performances, and installations. They raised money for the project through Kickstarter, and I contributed because I thought it was a cool idea. The schoolhouse was located in the back of a cemetery, which meant it was not easily accessible, and I had to get there by foot. When I arrived at the event, the space was filled with poetry enthusiasts. There were about twenty people there, all of whom seemed to know each other. The schoolhouse was small, and the only way to accommodate the readers was by setting up a makeshift stage in the middle of the room. It was a cozy space, and the atmosphere was relaxed. There were a few lights and a kerosene heater that gave off an aroma of burning gas, but it was warm, and the poetry was good. The first reader was a woman who lived in the Athens area. Her poetry was a reflection of her everyday life, and her style was quirky and charming. She read a poem about a smelly guy in a hammock, and she read about her father-in-law who loved to fish. She read a poem about a bad date in which she imagined a woman from the future judging her for her romantic choices, and she read a poem about riding her bike to work. Her poetry was personal, and it was entertaining. She was a talented writer, and it was refreshing to hear her unique perspective. There was a guy who read next. He had shoulder-length hair and a scruffy beard. He wore glasses, and he had a man bag. He read two poems that were more abstract and experimental. One poem was about a failed relationship, and the other poem was about his writing process. His poems were ambitious, and they were well-crafted. He had a lot of literary references, and he was very intellectual. The next reader was the master of ceremonies, and she read a poem about her son who was killed in a car accident when he was nineteen. The poem was heartfelt and moving. The poem was written as a letter to her son, and she expressed her pain and sadness in a way that was honest and sincere. She was a good poet, and her poem was haunting and beautiful. The fourth reader was a guy who had a story to tell. He was a painter, and he had a unique way of telling stories. He read a story about an artist who lived in a place called the \"Spooky House.\" The story took place in the 1950s, and the artist was a woman who worked in an art gallery. The story was funny and strange. It was about a boy who would come to the woman's house and watch her paint. He would sit in a chair with his leg propped up on an apple box, and the woman would paint a picture of the boy while he was in the chair. The final reader was a woman who lived in Athens. She was the one who organized the reading series at the schoolhouse, and she was the one who invited me to read there. She read a poem about her childhood. She read about her grandmother who lived in a house in the woods.

{"original_text": "Her cold wet nose nuzzled it's way into my clasped hands. As I reached out, wrapping my arms around her thick fur coat, the wet tissue fell from my hand to the floor. Typically this would of caused a riot for the 6 month old Lab; a signal for her to begin a new game of \"catch me if you can,\" but today was different. As the mascara streaked down my face, creating rivers of black tears; Nellie did not move and as I collapsed onto the floor, she gently fell next to me. Maybe it was her own love for Tom that gave her a deeper understanding of my pain. He had chosen her and driven the 3 hours to surprise me on my birthday. Tom had been the one who walked and played with her day after day as I lay in bed crippled with sadness after finding out I was unable to bare children. And although Tom took many business trips, Nellie clearly understood this trip was different. She understood that he was never coming home and yet her strength in supporting me was unaltered and altruistic. The months went by and Nellie became my best friend. While our love for Tom initially brought us together, it was force of fate that made me realize Nellie was my saving grace. It was her undying acceptance that pushed my hand into accepting myself, and it was her unfaltering love that provided me with hope. My desire to have children would never leave me but the void was filled by that little black lab, and she gladly played the part of my furry, four legged baby. Almost giddily I bought steaks at the deli, tonight for dinner we would celebrate Nellie's second birthday. I pictured her big brown eyes lighting up when she heard the meat hit the skillet, and her leaning ever so patiently against my leg as I finished cooking it. My joyful daydream quickly diminished as I rounded the corner to my small house. Something felt wrong. Nearing the front door I noticed it was slightly ajar. As my heart began to race I called out to her. My mind panicking, I reassured myself that Nellie would soon come bounding out to greet me; after all she was never one to wander away and was well trained to always stay in the confines of our front yard. My stomach churned as I opened the door and called for her once again. Nothing. The rest of the night was a blur. The thieves had ransacked my home, taking TVs, jewelry and of course what petty cash they could find. As I picked up my belongings I realized that the only missing thing I cared about was Nellie. Why would they take my dog? What were they doing to her? Had she been tired of being left alone while I worked and gladly followed them out of my life? I found myself crippled in my sorrows once again. This time I had nothing left. I had never been part of a family and was not quick to make friends. I had Tom and Nellie; now they were both gone. I found a bottle of whiskey in the cupboard and sat down to drown my sorrows. Hungover and depressed the next day I called into work. They could find someone else to write the news, I had a date with daytime soaps and a bottle of Jack. And while I knew this was only a temporary fix, I also knew that my mind would be unable to think of anything except how much I missed those big brown eyes. Months went by and each day got a little easier. Although no one could replace Tom, I even remarried a great man named Alex. It was a whirlwind romance that helped heal my heart from the devastating losses. I threw myself into my career and was quickly moving up the journalism ladder. When I uncovered what I believed to be an embezzlement scandal at the County funded drug rehabilitation center \"Renew\" I was thrilled. Of course this would be a tragedy for our community but I felt championed in my position as expose writer. This was not a story that I could half ass and I made it my duty to get every detail. I could barely sit still as I sat in the lobby of Renew waiting to meet with it's director. The bell on the front door would jingle as nurses and visitors funneled in and out of the building. In my own world, I barely acknowledged their presence until a wet cold nose nuzzled it's way under my hand, bumping it off the paper as I wrote. Glancing down I saw nothing but beautiful brown eyes staring up at me. \"Get over here, Angel!\" A young man pulled on the other end of the leash. \"I'm real sorry mam' she's not usually up in other peoples business but I guess she ain't afraid to bother you!\" I stared in disbelief. It was Nellie, there was no doubt in my mind. I reached out my hand to touch her, as I did she let out a happy whimper. Immediately dropping my journal I kneeled onto the floor to hug her. Tears filled my eyes as I turned to the young man. Trying to find the right words I studied him. He couldn't have been older than 25 but his face bore the marks of many struggles. His over sized clothes reaked of cigarette smoke. He gave me an awkward smile. \"I guess you like dogs huh?\" he half stated, half asked. \"Where did you get this dog?\" was all I could choke out. \"Someone gave her to me, why do you care?\" he seemed agitated by my quick interest and overwhelming love for his dog. As he started to pull on the leash I quickly came gathered my thoughts and backed off a little bit. Nellie nudged my hand again as I asked; \"Sorry I was just wondering where you got this incredible dog?\" His face softened and he relented. \"I used to be a patient here, someone found this poor pup in a drug house. They brought her here as a therapy dog. I don't know if we saved her or she saved me, but cause of her I ain't had any slip ups in 6 months now!\" Just as quickly as my heart had began racing my stomach began to sink. Here was my sweet Nellie, my best friend and yet no longer mine. \"Hey lady since ya'll like each other you think that you could watch her while I go talk to the lady at the desk? They make me fill out all this freakin paperwork just so I can bring her to my meetings\" I nodded.

{"original_text": "The atrium's filling up with spectators. Today's match is of a particular importance. Something about settling a dispute between two warring superpowers over some mining town in bumfuck nowhere. It's the kind of dispute that doesn't end well for the little people. I'm not sure who I'm rooting for. Both sides have been on the receiving end of a metaphorical \"Go fuck yourself!\" from me, so it's not like I have any allegiance to either. But I have to admit, it's a hell of a show. Two dozen combatants on each side, ranging from humans to yokai to dragons and... whatever the hell that other guy is supposed to be. I'm not sure how they're determining who's on which side. The judges, of course, will be up in the balcony. This is something that would normally never make it to the Court, but the fact that it's being televised makes it a public matter. There are two rules to keep in mind: whoever gets the better of the exchange gets to claim the disputed territory, and if it's a tie, neither side gets anything. I have a feeling this is going to be a tie. And now the combatants are ready. The teams have made their way to the ring, and the judges are being led in. Everyone is in their seats. No one in the atrium is paying attention to anything but the match that's about to start. Which is a shame, because a hell of a lot of interesting things are about to happen. The first thing is, the Head Judge gets up, and says he's going to deliver a judgment on the matter. A few people in the audience start to pay attention, but the majority still aren't looking at him. ...\"thus, on the basis of a review of both parties' evidence, I rule that the dispute be settled in favor of the Rokujou Insurrection.\" And then all hell breaks loose. I've seen this coming for a while now. I've seen the signs, and I've seen the faces of the people that are going to bring it all crashing down. The Tengu just walked in.

{"original_text": "Her dreams began, like many dreams began in those days, with hearing a song. Allison McLaughlin was on her way with her parents to the Tennessee Valley Fair when she heard the song, but it wasn't the song she heard that sparked her dream, it was a simple lyric in the song. \"I'm a little bit country, I'm a little bit rock and roll.\" Allison was a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll. She'd always been fascinated by the music and musicians that came out of the rock and roll era. The music was fast and fun, and as a little girl she could just dance to it all day long. She'd heard that rock and roll was considered devil's music by some and she thought that was silly, but when she heard her father say it was of the devil, she began to feel like she couldn't listen to it. Allison and her parents attended their church every Sunday and she had no reason to doubt the faith that was so prevalent in her life. She enjoyed reading the Bible and singing the hymns in church, and she believed with all her heart that Jesus was the Son of God and that he died for her sins. She knew that she was a sinner and that without Jesus she'd never see heaven. She wanted to live her life for God, and she wanted her parents to be proud of her. Allison's mother always told her that she could be anything she wanted to be when she grew up. She wanted to be a mother, but she wasn't sure that was all she wanted to be. She wanted to be a singer, too, but she had no idea how to get there. She didn't even know how to get her voice out there, much less how to get a record deal. Her father was the one who had gotten her to church and taught her about the faith that was so important to him, but he also knew how to laugh. He often talked about having a dream, but he didn't talk about the dreams he had. He never said that he wanted to do something other than what he was doing. She didn't know if he had ever wanted to be something different or if he was happy where he was. Allison's mother always told her that she could be anything she wanted to be, and that one day, she'd be famous. She'd tell her daughter that she'd make the headlines and people would want her autograph. She didn't know if her mother believed that or if it was just something she said. She wasn't sure she believed it, but she didn't say anything. Allison's mom wanted her daughter to be happy and she wanted her to be comfortable, and that was something that her mother could provide. Allison knew that her mom had always been good to her and she wanted to be good to her mom. She wanted to make her mom happy and proud, but she wasn't sure how to do that. Her mom always said, \"Just be yourself.\" Allison knew that her mother loved her, but she didn't know if her mother really liked her. She never really asked. She didn't know if her mother wanted her to be different than she was, but sometimes she thought that her mother wanted her to be different than she was. Allison's mom had always told her she was a special girl, but Allison wasn't sure that she believed it. She wasn't sure if she believed anything. She knew that she was a good person, but she wasn't sure if she was special. Allison's mom was the first person she came out to. She didn't know how to do it, and she didn't know how her mom would take it, but she knew that her mom was the only person who would love her no matter what. She knew that her mom would love her even if she wasn't the daughter she thought she was. She knew her mom would love her even if she didn't love the person she was. She knew her mom would love her, and she knew she could always come to her mom with anything. She'd always felt different from the other girls, but she'd never known why. She never knew why she felt different, and she never knew how to tell anyone that she felt that way. She wasn't sure if she knew, or if she'd known for a long time, or if she just knew now. She wasn't sure if she was confused or if she was just scared. She wasn't sure why she was scared, but she was.

{"original_text": "Teranthia had been gifting humans power for over a hundred years. No one knew how the planet granted powers to its denizens, or why the era of gifting began when it did. All that was certain was that the giftings had given the humans an advantage over the other races of the world. Closely following the gifting was the age of exploration. With this new power, the humans expanded their lands, driving away the native inhabitants. The earth was theirs. They took it by force. A thousand years later, humans had turned the entire planet into a waste land. A self-inflicted holocaust destroyed over ninety percent of the human race. The humans that had been granted powers had died first. Without the humans who had been granted powers to defend the planet, the other races began a new age of conquest. Humans lived on, but the world was now divided between the races that had been subjugated by humans. The gifting had changed that. All the races that had been subjugated by humans now had the power to defend themselves. Over the next thousand years, the humans slowly rebuilt their numbers. They had learned their lessons. They would not destroy their world again. The age of peace lasted for five hundred years. Then the gifting began again. This time, the gifting did not go to humans. It went to a group of human offshoots. Human in appearance, they were not the same as their cousins. The offshoots had been created by the Lords of Hell during the reign of the Demon King. The Lords had kept the offshoots in stasis, waiting for the right time to unleash them. The offshoots were created to destroy the world. Now that the gifting had gone to them, it was only a matter of time. The Lords of Hell woke the offshoots. They called them back to Hell. They unleashed them on the world. A thousand years later, the humans had won. The offshoots were gone. It was now the age of peace once more. Today, the world is once again at peace. Most of the people on the world don't even know about the offshoots. To them, they are just another myth, like the demons that came before them. However, there is a group of people who know the truth. They are the defenders of the world. They are the offspring of the old gods. They are the children of the gods. They are the Arcane.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "A thousand years ago, Teranthia, a planet in the Solar System, gave humans the power to rule the world.

{"original_text": "President-Regent Langley was due to meet with Chinese President Ha Jin today at noon, in the White House Blue Room. Press and other observers from both sides of the Pacific crowded the Rose Garden and the lobby, jockeying for entry. What the President-Regent did today how he conducted himself would determine the course of the current hostilities. The two statesmen danced the usual Kabuki act of formality: handshakes, mutual bows, an invitation to have a seat, smiles for the cameras. Their discussion in the Blue Room was not ever meant to be substantive, but just look good for the PR machine. The real discussions were happening, and would continue to happen, behind closed doors, in embassies and conference rooms, and they would involve not just the two heads of state but whole retinues of career diplomats working tirelessly, around the clock, to avert nuclear war. \"It's an honor to have you here today,\" President-Regent Langley said to President Ha Jin, once the two men had settled themselves in the plush leather chairs that angled toward one another. \"It is an honor to be here,\" President Ha Jin said in fluent English hardly an accent. \"Well,\" President-Regent Langley said, \"let's see how you feel after you've had some of my wife's cooking.\" Laughter from the press corps, flashbulbs popping. President Ha Jin arched his eyebrows, playing confused. \"Interesting custom,\" he intoned. \"Should not Cynthia Hannigan be cooking tonight's meal? She is, after all, the true First Lady.\" President-Regent Langley pretended to flick some lint off the knee of he pleated trousers. He wished he could reach across the small square table separating him from President Ha Jin and throttle him unconscious. Instead he plastered a pained smile across his face and said: \"Cynthia has been through a lot these past few months, as you're well aware. She isn't making public appearances just yet.\" He patted President Ha Jin on the shoulder and satisfied himself with the fantasy that he was doing much more violence to the man. \"Besides,\" he continued, \"young John is a mama's boy through and through, but Cynthia is hardly the First Lady. She is the President Mother. And on that note he flashed a toothier, more winning smile to the contingent of reporters \"I look forward to the day, hopefully soon, that our young President can have a real First Lady living by his side at the White House.\" \"Mm,\" President Ha Jin grunted. \"Then let us dispense with these niceties. Shall we sign the treaty?\" State department officials came in through the side door, bearing a small podium and a scroll with the treaty's text written upon it in a regal faux script. The terms were already set and approved by both nations' congresses this signing, too, was a nicety of its own kind. In exchange for the Chinese withdrawing its missile silos from the irradiated ruins of Hokkaido and its armies from beleaguered Honshu, allowing the Japanese people a self-determining government; the US had agreed to surrender the Beijing Five to Chinese custody, release control of its Pacific protectorates, and link the two nations' dynasties by marriage. The two statesmen each took a fountain pen. President Ha Jin stood and stooped over the podium to sign his name in Mandarin. He stepped aside and President-Regent Langley took his place. But before Langley could sign, Ha Jin stopped him. \"I do not believe,\" President Ha Jin said, \"according to your fine nation's constitution, that the Vice President has the power to sign any bills or treaties into law.\" President-Regent Langley's false smile dropped from his face. He allowed himself to appear angered projecting strength with regards to his claim on the Presidency was paramount. \"Don't be silly, now,\" he said. \"I am the acting President. Our constitution is very clear on this. I may sign bills into law.\" \"Nonetheless, I would rather John Hannigan sign the treaty, assuming he is literate. And I would like to see him, anyway. I was quite fond of his father, you will recall and since the young boy is soon to marry my daughter, I want to make his acquaintance.\" President-Regent Langley stopped himself from grimacing. This was a power play, naked and unashamed. He could buck back, join into a pissing contest assert firmly the legitimacy of his signature on the treaty. He wanted to, if only for his personal sense of pride. But more paramount than his claim on the Oval Office was that this treaty be successful. He would allow the Chinese no grounds on which to later dispute its terms. \"Have it your way,\" he said, cordially. \"President Hannigan just recently learned to sign his name and I think he would be proud to show everyone how precocious he is.\" Langley turned and said to an aid: \"please, go fetch John.\" President Ha Jin grinned smugly, but Langley had his own way of saving face in front of the world's eyes: \"since we are involving the young President,\" he said, \"why don't you fetch Qingxiang? They'll be husband and wife soon enough they should meet, don't you agree?\" President Ha Jin's ruddy complexion went slightly paler. But with reporters excitedly snapping photos and filming, he had no justification for refusing this ostensibly friendly request. In Mandarin, he asked his own aide to go get Qingxiang. Some moments later, little John Hannigan III, 56th President of the United States and Outlaying Territories and Protectorates, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Head of State and Government, and Defender of Liberty, toddled into the room. He could hardly yet walk, but wore a dapper dark black fitted suit, a gray silk shirt with matching blue silk tie, pointed loafers and pressed trousers. He was, as the papers loved to say time and again, the spitting image of his recently late father. President-Regent Langley knelt, the joints in his knees crackling. \"John,\" he said, \"we need you to sign your name.\" \"Sign my name!\" he said. \"Sign my name!\" He hopped up and down a couple times. \"That's right, John. Can you do that for us?\" \"Uh-huh!\" John's personal aides offered to get a hassock for him to stand upon so he could reach the podium to sign, but President-Regent Langley waved them off. Instead, he held John under the armpits and hoisted him up to the proper height. The press loved it, American and Chinese alike. John chewed on his tongue, trying his darnedest to sign neatly, just like he had been taught, though the result was still a splotchy chicken scratch that scrawled across the page. Langley beamed proudly while he held the young President. President Ha Jin blanched. Only someone like Langley could turn public humiliation at the hands of the Chinese into such a PR coup. That was why he was regent, after all. Soon after the signing was completed, President-Regent Langley suggested that the two signatories should finalize the treaty with a handshake. He relished the image of President Ha Jin bending forward to shake the hand of a toddler. You wanted to do your diplomacy with a child you got it, he thought bitterly. President Ha Jin's aides returned to the Blue Room with Qingxiang Jin in tow. She was two years older than John, and tall even for her age, so that side-by-side she seemed to tower over him. Her face was pale, and almost gaunt, her long raven hair often concealing her eyes. \"Hi,\" John said to his fiancee, \"I'm President Hannigan!\" \"I am Qingxiang,\" the girl said, struggling with what pieces of English she knew. Without prompting, the young President waddled forward and wrapped his arms around the girl he would soon wed. The girl went stiff, not sure how to respond, but with all eyes upon her she decided it would be best to hug him back. The press could not resist letting forth a chorus of awws and other heartwarmed cooing. President-Regent Langley felt like vomiting. But then Langley felt something else stirring inside him, as he watched the tiny girl. She didn't know what to do she kept glancing back at her father, who would give her no guidance, not even a simple nod or a shake of the head. President-Regent Langley considered the grim life that lay ahead of this girl. Yes, John liked her now, in his youthful naivety. But he would be raised to despise her. And thenceforth she would be a virtual prisoner in this foreign country, cut off from her family and all possibility of friends. She would be excluded from all government functions and distrusted by the people of both nations. Perhaps once or twice, when the couple came of age, John would joylessly rut inside of her and thereby produce the heirs that were the chief project of this marriage. And beyond this, her life would have no meaning. \"Let's hang out,\" John said, pulling back from the hug. \"We can play blocks!\" \"Blocks...\" Qingxiang said. \"Or dinosaurs! Do you like dinosaurs too?\" Qingxiang, startled and baffled, once more cast a glance back at her father, and once more received no help. She looked back at the young President. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I also like dinosaurs.\" \"What's your favorite?\" \"Erm Triceratops, I think.\" \"I like that one too,\" John said, nodding sagely. \"But T-Rex is my favorite. I have both, though. We can play them together!\" \"Hmm, that sounds fun.\" Langley did not like this. Neither did Ha Jin. But it was happening in public, and who were they to deny the two young lovebirds a play date? That would be a public relations disaster.

{"original_text": "Most people go through life with the ability to see. It doesn't matter if they need glasses, contacts or even corrective eye surgery they can see. Well I needed none of those things to see but now I need one of those things to see. On August 14th, 2007 I went to the eye doctor for an exam to get a prescription for new glasses. I had had my eye exam in July and the doctor said I had a slight cataract in my left eye. I assumed that would be the reason for this exam. When the doctor came in she said, \"This is not what I expected to see.\" I asked her what she expected to see. She said she was expecting to see a cataract. Well, you can imagine my surprise when she told me I had a mass in my eye, a tumor, and that I needed to see a specialist. I asked if I could get a copy of the report and she said she would have to send me a letter as that was the doctor's report. I received the letter on the 23rd of August. I called the specialist and they wanted me to come in the next day. I told them I was out of town and would be back in on the 28th. They asked me to come in then. I went in and they dilated my eyes and then did a tonometry (eye pressure test) and then I met with the doctor. He looked in my eyes with the microscope and then said that he would have to do an ultrasound on my eyes. I got a call the next day saying that I had a 10mm tumor in my left eye and I needed to be admitted to the hospital and see a surgeon. On September 4th, 2007 I was admitted to the hospital for surgery the next day. I met with the surgeon and he explained to me what the surgery was going to be about and the dangers of the surgery. He said they would remove the tumor, test it and then do chemotherapy on the tumor and put it back in my eye. September 5th, 2007. The surgery went well and I spent the night in the hospital. I came home the next day and had to get ready for my 40th birthday. The surgeon called me at home and told me the tumor was malignant. I said I know. He asked me how I knew. I told him my father had died of melanoma 15 years ago. He asked me if I had seen any melanoma on my body and I told him I had a mole on my back that had some brown spots and I also had a mole on my chin that was growing. He told me to make an appointment with a dermatologist to have them removed. I did that and the dermatologist removed the moles. The biopsy came back that the mole on my back was melanoma and the one on my chin was a skin cancer. The one on my back was 2.2mm, the one on my chin was 2.3mm. The tumor in my eye was 10mm. I had the chemotherapy done to the tumor and it was put back in my eye and I had to have it removed about 4 months later because it was too close to my retina. I had the surgery again and had to wait 6 weeks to get the results of the pathology. The results came back and said that it was \"Atypical Spindle Cell Melanoma\" with lymphovascular invasion. The doctor told me that the next step was to remove the eye. He said if I had to have another surgery in the future the odds of me keeping the eye were 20. I had to go through the process of accepting what was about to happen. He told me I would have to have my eye removed on March 27th. March 27th, 2008 came and I went in for the surgery. The doctor said they would remove the eye and put a prosthetic eye in its place. I thought I would be able to see out of it but that wasn't the case. I was up and around the next day and I noticed that I had been given a bandage contact lens. I thought it was a joke and I would have to wear the bandage until the surgery was healed.

{"original_text": "January 22, 2016. Today's the day. Again. As Jim looked at the date on his computer he couldn't help but feel anxious. He had been here a few times before, yet each time he was filled with a sense of dread. What if it didn't work? Well, he actually knew exactly what would happen if it didn't work. He'd wake up again. The real question was what if it did work. \"So let's run it through one more time.\" said Janet. \"We only have 30 minutes until the heart attack.\" One more time. As if that would help. He had run this plan through his head for centuries, and while Janet was aware of the plan and the stakes, she had no way of knowing she had as well. \"It's not that complicated Janet. In a minute I will step into the chamber, and hopefully, turn into a Popsicle.\" And not be groundhog'd any longer, he thought. He could only imagine it, a world past January 22, 2016. Who knows when he would wake up. The further in time the better. He would have more to work with that way. He could only hope that someone found a way to wake him up before his body decomposed to the point that the universe considered him dead. Then he would just wake up yesterday and have to try again. He thought back to a time when that very thing brought him excitement. The possibilities had been endless. At first he only fixed trivial things. A date gone wrong turned into a blossoming relationship. Failed lottery ticket purchases had turned him into a billionaire. Missed opportunities had turned into open doors all around him. The world was his playground. All it took was the pull of a trigger. Then he had realized the full potential of his groundhogging. He could go back till his very birth and relive his life however he wanted. Over and over. He had been the President of the United States, a world famous musician, an evil genius that ruled most of the world, a philanthropist that changed humanity for the better, a hermit who never left the house, a man who just wanted to die. Over and over and over his life played before him. People and places turned to mere tools that he could use and then restore. As long as he stayed within March 4, 1965 and January 22, 2016. It turns out the only thing he couldn't change was his genetics. No matter how healthy he ate or how in shape he was, his heart would give out today, and he would groundhog. As he looked around his lab he hoped that this time it would be different. With the last 3 lifetimes of work surrounding him, mainly a state of the art cryogenic chamber not expected to be a reality for at least a few more centuries, he wondered what his future would look like. Hopefully it would look like the future. Anytime past tomorrow. Then he would have more than just these past 50 years to utilize. Hell, there may even be someone else like him out there that could help him. \"Alright Jim, everything is dialed in and ready to go. Ready on your word.\" Janet said. Jim nervously walked across the room to the chamber. Please work. Please work. Please work. He kept thinking as he laid his body down into the machine. Once he laid down he heard Janet type into her computer and then the hiss of a motor near his head closed the chamber door. \"Can you hear me?\" Janet said. \"Loud and clear\" He replied over the intercom. \"Alright, we have 10 seconds until freeze.\" She said with a steady voice. \"Thank you for everything Janet. I couldn't have done this without you.\" Jim said. \"That's why you will make sure there is a statue of me in a big city in the future. Right?\" She said as the sound of the chamber's freezing cells started up. Right, he thought. An instant later everything went black. He felt the soft plush of a pillow under his head as he slowly came to. He didn't dare open his eyes. Maybe someone has retrofitted his Cryogenics chamber to be more comfortable. \"Good morning honey. Are you ready to see the future today?\" he heard Janet say from her position laying next to him.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "January 22, 2016. Today's the day. Again. As Jim looked at the date on his computer he couldn't help but feel anxious. He had been here a few times before, yet each time he was filled with a sense of dread. What if it didn't work? Well, he actually knew exactly what would happen if it didn't work. He'd wake up again. The real question was what if it did work. \"So let's run it through one more time.\" said Janet. \"We only have 30 minutes until the heart attack.\" One more time. As if that would help. He had run this plan through his head for centuries, and while Janet was aware of the plan and the stakes, she had no way of knowing she had as well. \"It's not that complicated Janet. In a minute I will step into the chamber, and hopefully, turn into a Popsicle.\" And not be groundhog'd any longer, he thought. He could only imagine it, a world past January 22, 2016. Who knows when he would wake up. The further in time the better. He would have more to work with that way. He could only hope that someone found a way to wake him up before his body decomposed to the point that the universe considered him dead. Then he would just wake up yesterday and have to try again. He thought back to a time when that very thing brought him excitement. The possibilities had been endless. At first he only fixed trivial things. A date gone wrong turned into a blossoming relationship. Failed lottery ticket purchases had turned him into a billionaire. Missed opportunities had turned into open doors all around him. The world was his playground. All it took was the pull of a trigger. Then he had realized the full potential of his groundhogging. He could go back till his very birth and relive his life however he wanted. Over and over. He had been the President of the United States, a world famous musician, an evil genius that ruled most of the world, a philanthropist that changed humanity for the better, a hermit who never left the house, a man who just wanted to die. Over and over and over his life played before him. People and places turned to mere tools that he could use and then restore. As long as he stayed within March 4, 1965 and January 22, 2016. It turns out the only thing he couldn't change was his genetics. No matter how healthy he ate or how in shape he was, his heart would give out today, and he would groundhog. As he looked around his lab he hoped that this time it would be different. With the last 3 lifetimes of work surrounding him, mainly a state of the art cryogenic chamber not expected to be a reality for at least a few more centuries, he wondered what his future would look like. Hopefully it would look like the future. Anytime past tomorrow. Then he would have more than just these past 50 years to utilize. Hell, there may even be someone else like him out there that could help him. \"Alright Jim, everything is dialed in and ready to go. Ready on your word.\" Janet said.

{"original_text": "It was the summer of'67, Hendrix was on the record player because Mister Morello insisted that they be the coolest burger joint in Mermaid's Landing. Ellie-May Richter checked and rechecked the patties cooking on the grill because she was always the most responsible of the four who had a job there. Ginny watched the clock while she waited to get off work because she was the most impatient. And Tessie - well, Tessie was the youngest and the only one who could close up shop because she was the only one who'd been there the longest and the other three needed her to be the responsible one, which she really wasn't, even though she thought she was. They'd been working there all summer and it'd been so much fun until they decided to sneak out and hang out on the beach after closing time. But they got caught. That night Mister Morello took away their keys to the shop and fired all of them. \"But we had nothing to do with it,\" Tessie protested, and Ginny piped up, \"We're the best workers you've got!\" and Ellie-May added, \"But we're the only workers you've got!\" Mister Morello stared at them, like they were nuts. Then he threw the keys back into Tessie's hands and said, \"You've got one more chance. But you'd better not mess up.\" They were all so happy that they hugged and jumped up and down and yelled and made a lot of noise, but Tessie didn't forget that she had to get off work and go home, and she knew that Ginny didn't want to miss the bus, and Ellie-May didn't want to miss the ice cream truck, and they knew that Ginny and Ellie-May didn't want to miss the bus or the ice cream truck, so they all raced to finish their work as quickly as they could. When they were done, Tessie closed up and they all went home, just as they did every other night. But they were so happy that it seemed like it'd been their first day at work, not their last. Little did they know that this was the night when something strange would happen that would change their lives forever. It was the summer of'67 and Tessie Richter was thirteen years old and a lot of things were happening that made her feel different. Like her hair growing out into a big, curly, frizzy mess that her mom had to cut and cut and cut some more. Or the fact that she and Ginny had started going to school and now all the kids were making fun of them because they were a year younger than the other girls. And on top of that, there was a boy who was always following her around. She didn't want to be followed. She wanted to be left alone. Especially since she didn't like him. Tessie and Ginny were twins and so most people thought that they were alike in every way, but they weren't. Ginny was a goody-goody and Tessie was a troublemaker. Tessie had freckles and Ginny didn't. Tessie was taller, and Ginny was smarter. Ginny was serious, and Tessie was silly. And that was why it was so strange that they were both interested in the same boy. Tessie had never really had a crush on anyone before, and this boy was the last person she would have expected to like. But there it was: he'd moved to Mermaid's Landing in the middle of the summer and Ginny and Tessie and Ellie-May and Ginny's best friend, Janice, had all fallen head over heels for him. They'd been after him since the first day they'd seen him at the pool, and even though he never seemed to pay much attention to them, they never gave up. And now it seemed like they were really going to have a chance to get to know him. He'd been working at the ice cream shop for the past few weeks, and he had the afternoon shift, which meant that they'd see him every day after school. Tessie had never been so excited in her life. She'd been waiting for her chance to get to know him and make him fall in love with her, but it seemed like every time she had a chance to talk to him, she did something really stupid.

Absently he scratched at one on the back of his hand. It reminded him of lightning - it's forked spikes reaching from wrist towards knuckles. He stopped his observations however as the master passed by and instead kept sweeping. As an orphan and an outcast he had no rights and thought himself lucky that he at least had a few meals a week. It was funny really. Without the outcasts to sweep, mine and toil the citizens would have no crafts or livelihoods with which to placate the high class. And if they were not placated then they would skip the citizens and merely execute a few dozen outcasts. Surely if that continued then a time would come when there were no outcasts to toil, then who would they slaughter? Probably not the citizens, because it wasn't their fault that the Gods had vanished three centuries ago. Oh no, that was the outcasts. Of course. Josa kept his thoughts locked inside his own mind, to question a higher class was to be executed and he had no intention of following in his father's footsteps, or his mother's for that matter. At thirteen or so Josa was too young to work the heavy machinery in the textile mill, but in a few years he would be under the master's whip. Thankfully Josa's fascination with his markings kept his mind from that most of the time. Everyone in Ladenel had markings. Inky black stains that formed patterns and shapes. Josa always thought his were different but it seemed everyone thought the same about their own. Other people's markings were just squiggles to him, but his own had a pattern. The one on his hand was like lightning, his arms contained quick lines like the hurried strokes of a high class painter - seemingly making no concrete shape and yet having a pattern to them all the same. Here and there flame-like shapes licked his skin, perfect, dark circles the size of small fruits dominated other areas and something shaped like the sun sat on his forehead. A pale circle surrounded by lines shining out from it. He had spent countless nights sitting and staring at his marks by moonlight and still had no answers. Some of the high class scholars believed that they predicted the life events of the person. A few radicals thought they were events from a past life and setup whole libraries to catalog and study them hoping to work out who a person was in their previous life. Josa didn't believe either. It wasn't that he thought they were wrong just that he didn't think they were particularly right either. Perhaps the lightning meant he would be struck one day - killed even. The sun on his forehead could be the God under which he was born. The circles? He hadn't decided those yet, nor the lines and flames. Shouts shocked Josa back to the real world. A commotion was brewing outside the mill. Men's voices shouting at each other. Josa glanced around and didn't see the master so he made his way towards the sounds at the far end of the mill, near a wide sliding door. It was shut but it was also very thin. Through he he could hear the voices more clearly. It was a fight of some kind. Not that unusual, but then the faint clinking of chainmail and drawing of swords. Josa slid the doors open a slither and peeked out. What he saw terrified him. Three burly outcasts - marked by their ragged clothing and dirty skin - stood above a motionless guard. His vibrant cloak lying limp on the floor revealing his sparkling chain stained crimson. Two of the men held swords. One looked fine and ornate - the guard's most likely Josa thought - and the other was much more basic and less kept. The shouting had stopped and the three men regarded their equally numbered counterparts eagerly. The guards wore their own rich, red and blue cloaks. Square looking hats adorned their heads and golden buttons accentuated both cloak and hat. Beneath the finery however was a soldier's garb. Chain mail and leather. A large sheath and a smaller knife pouch - after all, the outcasts vastly outnumbered the guard. A flurry of activity began, slashing swords glinting golden sunlight, brilliant cloaks flapping with motion. A few cries, a scream, a thud and a clang of steel. Then the street was silent again. One man remained standing, four dead guards, two dead outcast and a lone, bloody figure standing above them all. Then the man dropped his fine sword and ran. Seconds later Josa heard the shouts and pounding feet of reinforcements drawn to the commotion but the man, the hero, was long gone. What man would dare do such a thing? Josa was part awed and part terrified. He longed to stand up to the high class himself. Not five years ago they had killed his parents by execution for no crime. They were merely outcasts and therefore deserved no life. But despite his brave desires he was too small, too weak and too scared to do what that hero had just done. The approaching guards checked the bodies for life and then began to search the area. One looked Josa's way and caught a glimpse before the boy dashed away. A moment later the doors were wrenched open by two of the guards. Josa ran. But a half starved boy had no chance outrunning well fed and trained soldiers. The mill was big, and had rows of fast moving, spinning machinery, dangerous machinery. The perfect place to hide. Josa sprinted down an aisle between machines.

In the three hundred years since the Village on the Brook had been founded by their sires, none had yet compared to the suppleness of his cured skins, nor the enduring boots and cloaks that were born from the harvest of his labor.

It was the gospel truth that though he was polite, he didn't seek the attention or intention of any man-a fit trait for his trade-and none of any woman, save that of Joanna Thatcher. Her dark, flaxen lined hair was like gossamer in his heart, the light of her smile the north star of his dreams, which themselves were tinted the color of her evergreen eyes. Oft he would sit and wait by the tanning vats just as the last dim light of day cast it's gleam off the steam rising from them, and more often than not she would come, and he would glimpse her for a brief moment as she plunged fearlessly into the heart of the woods to chase her own love, the Fae. The Fae were a mighty, wild folk that dwelt in desolate lands such as the Village on the Brook. They were as liable to cruelty as kindness, to pain as comfort, and the difference was little seen to them. To her they were freedom and a clever madness, and so she would depart in the grey of the morn and the twilight of evening when they're closest to Man, and pursue them as the relentless hunter pursues a buck. Oft she came back, pale, breathless, her eyes like a quarried dog, and Tanner glimpsed her before she passed from sight into the thicket. Sometimes she would return with tears, and he knew that she'd been kissed, or struck, or both, and his heart hurt in different ways. Once as she came back, a scar over eyes filled with the ruin of defeat, he felt his heart stop within him. It remained so as he followed her home, a few steps behind so that she never saw nor heard him. She walked slowly back into her house, a small, well thatched hut within view of the Brook. A few moments later, he reached the door, and as if possessed, knocked upon it and asked for her hand. She refused, yet, he persisted.

One of Chuck's favorite memories was the time the Bengals beat the Oakland Raiders in the playoffs. He was seventeen years old at the time. The Bengals had never been to the Super Bowl. Mildred liked to make fun of him because every year when the Bengals won the AFC North division, he would make his annual prediction that this would be the year they would go all the way.

{"original_text": "Angelique was having an intense staring competition with the clock above the tv on the opposite end of the room. 10 minutes. Ten minutes to go. At the end of those ten minutes, she would learn what the rest of her life would be like. The seconds seemed to slow and it felt like it took hours for a single moment to pass. Angelique's stomach tightened, and she glanced around the room at the party guests. In just ten minutes, it would be 18 years to the second since she was born. And then she would get to be like the rest of her friends and classmates. The young girl, with mahogany hair and tan skin, was the youngest in her class, and quite possibly in her grade at school. Naturally, everyone else had already received their powers. Some people's powers were limited to small'party tricks', such as changing their appearance, and had no significant effect on their surroundings. Some had abilities that made their life easier, such as hovering a couple inches off the ground, allowing them to easily glide down the street. In more extreme cases, students received potentially dangerous powers that required them to see a psychiatrist at least once a month to make sure they could handle the responsibility, or, if they were lucky, they received potentially life-saving powers and were recruited into the NHA, National Heroes Association. A sort of super-natural police force. So far there had been little more then a handful of those people at Angelique's school that year, although she hoped to possibly be added to that small list. Sensing her distress, her friend, Sam, who was lounging on the couch beside her, waved her hand in front of her face, breaking her out of her trance. \" Yoohoo! \" She chirped, giggling. \" Why don't you take your eyes off the clock for a moment? You're not gon na make time fly any faster that way, ya know. \" \" Y-yeah..... ok, sure, \" Angelique stammered. \" So what kind of cake did you get? \" Sam asked, trying to distract her friend. \" Oh, it's red velvet. Nothing too special. \" \" Sounds absolutely delicious. \" Angelique reflexively glanced back at the clock, which now told her she had 7 minutes left, only have Sam cup her cheek, turning her head and forcing her to look away again. \" Did you watch that anime I told you about? \" \" A bit. I don't think it's really my thing. \" \" Aww, but it's so awesome! \" \" It's kinda creepy, really. Why is there some kind of sexually-charged event every five minutes? \" The meaningless chatter continued between the two of them. Every time their conversation seemed to reach a dead end, Sam frantically grabbed at another random topic, like a random song she heard on the radio that she didn't understand, or a piece of local news that didn't really affect anything. Angelique could tell Sam was trying her best to keep her anxiety low, and she was grateful for her efforts. But every now and then she would manage she catch a glimpse of the clock, and recalculated the time she had left. 5 minutes, then 3, 2, 1..... Angelique watched as the seconds ticked down to the final moment, then closed her eyes. The room got quiet. There was only the sound of wind blowing past and the feeling of intense sunlight on her skin. Sunlight? That wasn't right..... even if she was outside, it was a cloudy day, with no sunlight anywhere near her house. Angelique opened her eyes and found herself in the middle of a foreign landscape. A flat, dry, wasteland. There was nothing around her except for dust and rocks. No plant or animal life to be seen. She looked up into a dark blue sky and shielded her eyes from the bright red sun that beat down on her. Within seconds, her skin began to burn, and she struggled to breathe. It only got worse and worse as her skin began to boil in the hot sun. With the last of her breath, she let out a choked scream, and collapsed to the ground. - No one was ever certain about what happened to Angelique. At the very moment where she should have gained her powers, she seemed to slip into a trance-like state, then her eyes rolled back into her head and she screamed before falling unconscious. On the way to the hospital, she began to spasm uncontrollably. Once they got to the ER, the doctors told her parents that she was in a coma. Sometimes, when a person gains their power, it's simply too much for them to bear. No one ever gets to know what the power is, and their brain activity is undecipherable. If there's a way to deactivate the power, the victim never seems to have a calm enough moment to find out how to. No drugs or medical procedures can bring them out of their shock. A week later, after watching Angelique's body shake and choke with no end in sight, Angelique's parents were forced to make the difficult decision to cut her life support, and watched as her vital functions slowed to a halt, never to start again.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "Angelique was having an intense staring competition with the clock above the tv on the opposite end of the room. 10 minutes.

{"original_text": "\"Will I be safe?\" Asked Christopher. There was a moment of silence. The words came slithering from the dark in a low and comforting tone. A whisper. \"Of course...\" A light sigh. \"I'm always here for you. I will always keep you safe...\" Christopher looked around the room for the source of the voice. He was alone. \"I'm not afraid of the dark anymore\" he said to himself, still searching. \"I have you now.\" There was a sudden movement from the corner of his eye. He turned and looked out into the darkness of his bedroom. The lamp was flickering again. As if there was a slight breeze, and the air had been disturbed. \"Who's there?\" Christopher called out, but there was no reply. Christopher slowly rose from his bed, and made his way over to the door. He was suddenly aware of the temperature in his room dropping. He had chills, and it was making his skin crawl. His hand rested on the door handle, but he couldn't bring himself to turn it. He felt an overwhelming sense of dread. \"Please let me be safe.\" He whispered, but still there was no reply. There was a sudden crash as the door burst open. The lamp smashed to the floor and shattered. Christopher was knocked to the ground. He couldn't see who had done this, but his mind had already made up its answer. He knew who was responsible. \"I'm sorry.\" He said. \"I won't tell anyone.\" \"No!\" Christopher said, rising to his feet. He picked up the fragments of the lamp. \"I know who you are. I know you're here.\" Christopher's voice was strong, but there was still a slight tremble. He was scared, but he didn't want his friend to see that. He wanted to be strong for him. \"Don't worry.\" Said the voice. \"I'll keep you safe. I'll always keep you safe.\" \"I know.\" Said Christopher. \"But I want to be brave. I'm not afraid of the dark anymore.\" The flickering lamp grew brighter. The temperature in the room rose back to normal. Christopher looked around, but there was still no sign of his friend. \"I'm sorry\" he said. \"I'm just tired, and I need some sleep. I'm sorry.\" Christopher made his way back to his bed. He was still shaking, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of guilt. \"I'm sorry.\" He said to himself. \"I just need to get some sleep. I just need to get some sleep.\" Christopher climbed into bed, closed his eyes and tried to sleep. He kept repeating the words to himself. Over and over again. \"I'm sorry. I just need to get some sleep. I just need to get some sleep.\" The words grew louder and louder until they became a scream. Christopher was startled from his sleep. He didn't know if it was he who had been screaming, or if it had been someone else. \"I just need to get some sleep.\" He repeated. There was a sudden crash from the end of the bed. Christopher turned and looked. There was something standing there. It was small, no more than a foot tall. It was wearing a simple white dress, and had long black hair. Christopher could see that it was holding something in its arms. \"You're hurt.\" Christopher said. \"I can see that you're hurt. I'm sorry.\" \"You're hurt.\" Christopher said. \"I can see that you're hurt. I'm sorry.\" Christopher looked at the object in the little girls arms. It was a broken porcelain doll. It looked like a boy. \"That's me.\" Said the voice. \"I'm hurt. I'm broken. You're not afraid of the dark anymore. I just want to be safe.\" Christopher started to cry. He couldn't bear to see his friend this way. He was so hurt. So broken. \"I'm sorry.\" Christopher said. \"I just want to be safe.\" \"Then you can stay with me.\" The girl said. \"But you have to promise to keep me safe.\" \"I promise.\" Christopher said. \"Then you can stay with me.\" The girl said. \"But you have to promise to keep me safe.

He was alone. \"I'm not afraid of the dark anymore\" he said to himself, still searching. \"I have you now.\" There was a sudden movement from the corner of his eye. He turned and looked out into the darkness of his bedroom. The lamp was flickering again. As if there was a slight breeze, and the air had been disturbed. \"Who's there?\" Christopher called out, but there was no reply. Christopher slowly rose from his bed, and made his way over to the door. He was suddenly aware of the temperature in his room dropping. He had chills, and it was making his skin crawl. His hand rested on the door handle, but he couldn't bring himself to turn it. He felt an overwhelming sense of dread. \"Please let me be safe.\" He whispered, but still there was no reply. There was a sudden crash as the door burst open. The lamp smashed to the floor and shattered. Christopher was knocked to the ground. He couldn't see who had done this, but his mind had already made up its answer. He knew who was responsible. \"I'm sorry.\" He said. \"I won't tell anyone.\" \"No!\" Christopher said, rising to his feet. He picked up the fragments of the lamp. \"I know who you are. I know you're here.\" Christopher's voice was strong, but there was still a slight tremble. He was scared, but he didn't want his friend to see that. He wanted to be strong for him. \"Don't worry.\" Said the voice. \"I'll keep you safe. I'll always keep you safe.\" \"I know.\" Said Christopher. \"But I want to be brave. I'm not afraid of the dark anymore.\" The flickering lamp grew brighter. The temperature in the room rose back to normal. Christopher looked around, but there was still no sign of his friend. \"I'm sorry\" he said. \"I'm just tired, and I need some sleep. I'm sorry.\" Christopher made his way back to his bed. He was still shaking, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of guilt. \"I'm sorry.\" He said to himself. \"I just need to get some sleep. I just need to get some sleep.\" Christopher climbed into bed, closed his eyes and tried to sleep. He kept repeating the words to himself. Over and over again. \"I'm sorry. I just need to get some sleep. I just need to get some sleep.\" The words grew louder and louder until they became a scream. Christopher was startled from his sleep. He didn't know if it was he who had been screaming, or if it had been someone else. \"I just need to get some sleep.\" He repeated. There was a sudden crash from the end of the bed. Christopher turned and looked. There was something standing there. It was small, no more than a foot tall. It was wearing a simple white dress, and had long black hair. Christopher could see that it was holding something in its arms. \"You're hurt.\" Christopher said. \"I can see that you're hurt. I'm sorry.\" \"You're hurt.\" Christopher said. \"I can see that you're hurt. I'm sorry.\" Christopher looked at the object in the little girls arms. It was a broken porcelain doll. It looked like a boy. \"That's me.\" Said the voice. \"I'm hurt. I'm broken. You're not afraid of the dark anymore. I just want to be safe.\" Christopher started to cry. He couldn't bear to see his friend this way. He was so hurt. So broken. \"I'm sorry.\" Christopher said. \"I just want to be safe.\" \"Then you can stay with me.\" The girl said. \"But you have to promise to keep me safe.\" \"I promise.\" Christopher said. \"Then you can stay with me.\" The girl said. \"But you have to promise to keep me safe. I'm hurt. I'm broken. You're not afraid of the dark anymore. I just want to be safe.\""}

A ghost wandered into the elevator on the third floor. She wore a white dress, like no one does anymore. He hair was up, except for a wavy lock that fell down to her cheek. Her shoes were shining, like they'd never been worn. She looked like a woman, or a girl, who belonged somewhere else. The elevator door shut and the bell sounded. The ghost did not move. The ghost stood, as if waiting. I took the ghost's hand and she stepped with me to the floor. The ghost led me through the lobby, out the glass doors, into the night. She held my hand, and I felt her bones. She led me down the street, to the diner where the lights were on. The place was empty, except for the ghost who stood in the booth, where once I sat. The ghost sat down, still holding my hand, and smiled at me. I smiled back. \"You're a ghost,\" I said. She smiled and said, \"I'm waiting for someone.\" \"Someone comes for me.\" \"To take you back?\" \"I'm not afraid,\" she said. \"I don't want you to be afraid.\" \"It's okay,\" she said. \"He's nice.\" \"Well, he's the one who killed me.\" \"You don't mind?\" \"He's a nice man.\" \"You don't want to leave?\" \"No,\" she said. \"I can't. Not yet.\" \"Not until someone finds me.\" \"I'm looking,\" she said. \"Are you sure? There are a lot of people out there.\" \"No,\" I said. \"I can't find her.\" \"Then you're not looking hard enough.\" \"I can't,\" I said. \"I'm not that good.\" \"I didn't think you were,\" she said. \"I could tell.\" \"Then you know I'm a failure.\" \"No,\" she said. \"You're just not looking hard enough.\" She took my hand and stood. We walked through the empty diner, out the door, into the night. She led me down the street, back to the lobby of the old hotel. The elevator doors opened, and she stepped in. I followed her, and we rode up to the third floor. We walked down the hallway. She knocked on a door. I heard a man's voice. \"There's someone here to see you,\" she said. \"Oh,\" the man said. \"Well, come on in.\" I followed her into the room, and she let go of my hand. The man was on the bed, dressed in white. He smiled at me. \"Did you find her?\" he asked. \"No,\" she said. \"She's not looking hard enough.\" \"I guess not,\" he said. \"She's not a failure,\" she said. \"She's just not looking hard enough.\" \"Yeah,\" he said. \"She's not a failure. She's just not looking hard enough.\" \"Now you know,\" she said. \"Now you know.\" \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Now I know.\" She took my hand. \"You're not a failure,\" she said. \"You're just not looking hard enough.\" She led me back out of the room, and down the hall. The elevator door opened. She stepped in, and I followed her. We rode to the lobby and walked out the door. She looked at me and smiled. \"You can go,\" she said. \"You can go. You're not a failure.
