His 'Disputation against Scholastic Theology' in 1517 was a frontal attack on the church's attempts to transform the poorly educated clergy into theologians. The next year he issued a programme of reform that was a careful compromise with existing arrangements: he promised to eliminate the sale of indulgences, but he also defended the idea of them, along with a variety of other practices. It was the church, he said, that would decide which practices to continue. The Disputation against the Scholastic Theology (1517) has been translated into English, as has the outline of a reform programme that Luther published the following year. In 1519 Luther was recalled to Wittenberg from the Augustinian house in Wittenberg, where he had been living since 1512, to lecture on the Bible to the university's students. There he was called upon to review a new Bible translation, the New Testament of which was translated from Greek into German by the humanist Desiderius Erasmus. As a devout Augustinian monk and committed teacher of the Bible, Luther was convinced that the Bible was the supreme authority for Christian faith and life. On this basis, he criticized the new translation for its inaccuracy, lack of clarity, and failure to address the spiritual needs of the reader. In response, Luther began translating the Bible into German, a project that he completed in 1534. In 1520, the papal authorities, who had been investigating Luther's teachings since 1518, responded to his challenge. They demanded that he recant and threatened to excommunicate him if he refused. Luther was summoned to appear before the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, at the imperial diet in the German city of Worms. There, in April 1521, he refused to retract his writings and was subsequently excommunicated by the pope. To his friends and supporters, Luther had become a hero, but to his opponents he was a heretic who must be punished. Luther's supporters sheltered him in Wartburg castle, where he lived under the alias of a knight named George. There he completed his translation of the Bible and in 1522 began to write devotional texts, catechisms, and hymns, which he hoped would help the common people understand the new ideas that he had introduced. Back in Wittenberg in 1522, Luther promoted the Reformation by helping to develop a new form of church order. Together with the German humanist and statesman Philip Melanchthon, he wrote a new liturgy and a series of catechisms that introduced the new teachings to laypeople. He also helped to reform the university in Wittenberg, and in 1524 he began to write his great commentaries on the books of the Bible. In the same year he married Katharina von Bora, a former nun, and established a family with her. Throughout the 1520s Luther worked to strengthen his position in the church and society.

The graph appeared to show a sharp rise in the 20th century, much steeper than the apparent variations in earlier centuries. The graph was featured in the Summary for Policymakers of the Third Assessment Report (TAR), and gained the popular name \"hockey stick graph\" because of its shape, which some commentators have noted is similar to that of an ice hockey stick. Mann, Bradley and Hughes used statistical techniques to combine a set of proxy measurements, or indicators of past temperatures, taken from historical records and other sources such as tree rings, ice cores, coral and lake sediments. They created a graph of the northern hemisphere mean temperature over the last 600 years, and reported that their graph showed a sharp rise in the late 20th century, in comparison to the earlier centuries. A strong divergence between the proxy data and instrumental data was apparent after about 1970.

This greatly improved the efficiency of the engine by reducing fuel consumption. Watt also developed a double-acting engine where the cylinder was closed at one end.

{"original_text": "While in-house production had ceased, the BBC hoped to find an independent production company to relaunch the show. Philip Segal, a British expatriate who worked for Columbia Pictures' television arm in the US, proposed the idea of relaunching the series to the BBC, and eventually the Corporation asked him to oversee the project. Segal's initial proposal envisaged the use of American writers and a predominantly US cast with a British producer. Freedman was unwilling to allow the series to be made outside the UK, and insisted on a predominantly British cast and production team. Segal's next idea was to form a co-production between Columbia Pictures Television, Universal Studios, 20th Century Fox and BBC Worldwide, a commercial arm of the BBC. This did not come to pass, and Segal was approached by BBC Enterprises who agreed to independently finance the production if the rights could be obtained. Segal acquired the rights from the BBC in exchange for a guarantee that a Doctor Who television movie would be produced within three years.

Fox, NBC, ABC, and UPN all expressed interest, but concerns over the violence and sexual content that had been present in the original series led to them passing on the project.

Eric Roberts, who had previously appeared in The Cannonball Run and The Dark Knight, was cast in the part. The casting of Daphne Ashbrook, who had appeared in the short-lived series Catwalk, as Grace Holloway was controversial with some fans, who were upset that an American was being cast in the role of the Doctor's companion.

The movie was directed by Geoffrey Sax, produced by Philip David Segal, and written by Matthew Jacobs. The movie was intended to be fast-paced, with several special effects-laden action sequences, and would have a length of two hours. As the movie had a relatively large budget, there were a number of high-profile special effects; the TARDIS interior set was completely redesigned, with a swimming pool-like console room. The Master was given a new look; his face was covered in bandages to hide the fact that Eric Roberts was American, rather than British. This was later changed to the Master removing his own face, which he keeps in a jar. The Eye of Harmony was given a new look, with the special effects team creating a three-dimensional representation of a black hole. The television movie was originally intended to have a full-orchestral score, but this was changed to an electronic score by John Debney. The movie was originally intended to be given a prime-time broadcast slot in the US, but was moved to May when it was realised that the movie would clash with coverage of the 1996 Olympics.

Segal's initial proposal envisaged the use of American writers and a predominantly US cast with a British producer. Freedman was unwilling to allow the series to be made outside the UK, and insisted on a predominantly British cast and production team. Segal's next idea was to form a co-production between Columbia Pictures Television, Universal Studios, 20th Century Fox and BBC Worldwide, a commercial arm of the BBC. This did not come to pass, and Segal was approached by BBC Enterprises who agreed to independently finance the production if the rights could be obtained.

{"original_text": "Later in life, Tesla made claims concerning a \"teleforce\" weapon after studying the Van de Graaff generator. The press variably referred to it as a \"peace ray\" or death ray. Tesla described the weapon as being able to be used against ground based infantry or for anti-aircraft purposes. Tesla gave no explanations as to how the directed-energy weapon would operate, though it has been suggested that the he meant to use a stream of tachyons (hypothetical particles that move faster than light). In 1937, Tesla wrote about it to Tryntje (Katherine) Rogers, a woman from The Netherlands who ran a spiritual center and was a follower of his. In 1940, Tesla composed a treatise entitled \"The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media.\" Tesla tried to explain that there was \"a difference between the apparatus I have described as the ray of death and the invention I have described as the peace ray. The ray of death is not a new invention but a development of an apparatus I constructed many years ago. It is a beautiful apparatus, but a terrible weapon. Before the present war began, I approached the United States Government, suggesting that this apparatus be used against the invading army of Germany. The suggestion fell on deaf ears, though I gave the matter thorough consideration. The [peace ray] apparatus requires much power, and I have devised a means of developing great power. The apparatus is so constructed that it is at once an offensive and defensive weapon, enabling nation to destroy any country approaching it with hostile intent by simply directing the ray to the enemy's capital, thereby rendering him impotent before invading his territory. This is not a dream. It is a simple feat of scientific electrical engineering, only expensive blind, faint-hearted, doubting world. Humanity is not yet sufficiently advanced to be willingly led by the discoverer's keen searching sense. But who knows? Perhaps it is better in this present world of ours that a revolutionary idea or invention instead of being helped and patted, be hampered and ill-treated in its adolescence by want of means, by selfish interest, pedantry, stupidity and ignorance; that it be attacked and stifled; that it pass through bitter trials and tribulations, through the strife of commercial existence. So the idea matures. It is thus that all great discoveries are made, by trials, error, perseverance. When you look at the power and potential of Tesla's invention, it is easy to see why governments would want to keep it under wraps. Tesla's \"Teleforce\" weapon was based on a channeling of radiant energy which Tesla said could be used for either good or evil purposes. Tesla claimed he had developed a weapon of tremendous destructive power that could be used against aircraft or ground forces. He later changed his description of the weapon to a more peaceful one. But one of the many mysteries surrounding Tesla and his ideas, is what did Tesla mean when he said he had discovered a new energy source that was of tremendous power? Tesla said he was a \"blasted by cosmic rays\" and from this he had developed a new form of energy. Tesla discovered that when he was exposed to these cosmic rays he was able to develop what he called \"a new kind of matter.\" Tesla's notes indicate that this new form of matter could be used to produce \"free energy\" or energy that could be used to \"destroy the earth.\" Tesla believed he had tapped into a new and unknown energy source. One that was not only revolutionary in its ability to provide free and clean energy, but also in its power to destroy. Tesla's idea that he had discovered a new source of energy was met with ridicule and scepticism. Many scientists and theorists have tried to unravel Tesla's mysterious claims. While Tesla's secrets died with him, some theorists believe that Tesla had discovered a new way to harness the energy of the sun. If Tesla had discovered a way to harness the energy of the sun, it would explain the comments that he had \"obtained new principles of power and motion\" and that he had discovered a new and \"more powerful\" source of energy. Tesla claimed his greatest contribution was in the discovery of a new source of energy.

{"original_text": "Some theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities. Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as trade unions and religious organizations is also justified if the organization's decision would be unjust. While I'm sympathetic to her general line of reasoning, I find that Brownlee's argument is not wholly persuasive. The central question that motivates Brownlee's argument is: Is it ever justified to disobey a decision that has been made by a group one belongs to? That is, if I belong to a group that has made a decision, is it ever justified for me to disobey the decision? According to Brownlee, there are three possible answers to this question: (1) All disobedience in this context is justified, (2) no disobedience is justified, or (3) some disobedience is justified. Brownlee argues that the third answer is the correct one and that it has important implications for theories of civil disobedience. To make her case, Brownlee presents two puzzles. The first puzzle is what she calls the \"Group Obedience Puzzle.\" In this puzzle, a group, G, makes a decision, D, which an individual, I, thinks is unjust. In order to resolve the puzzle, we must determine whether I ought to obey the decision that the group made. According to Brownlee, the intuitive answer to this puzzle is that I ought to disobey D. This is because, according to Brownlee, we think that it is morally permissible to disobey decisions made by groups of which we are a member. Yet, Brownlee claims, this intuitive answer leads to the problem that I would also have to disobey D1, a decision made by the group that has the same content as D but is made by a different group, G1. This is problematic because it leads to a contradiction: If I ought to obey D1, then I ought to obey D because it has the same content as D1. But if I ought to obey D1, then I ought to obey D. And, since I ought not to obey D, the contradiction leads us to conclude that I ought to obey D1. However, this is also problematic, since the intuitive answer to the puzzle was that I ought to disobey D. The second puzzle is what she calls the \"Individual Obedience Puzzle.\" In this puzzle, a group, G, makes a decision, D, which an individual, I, thinks is unjust. However, in this puzzle, it is not the case that I is a member of G. According to Brownlee, the intuitive answer to this puzzle is that I ought not to disobey D. However, this answer leads to the problem that I would also have to obey D1, a decision made by the group that has the same content as D but is made by a different group, G1. This is problematic because it leads to a contradiction: If I ought to obey D, then I ought to obey D1. But if I ought to obey D, then I ought not to obey D1. And, since I ought to obey D1, the contradiction leads us to conclude that I ought not to obey D. However, this is also problematic, since the intuitive answer to the puzzle was that I ought not to disobey D. Brownlee argues that, in order to resolve these puzzles, we must either reject the intuition that it is morally permissible to disobey a decision made by a group of which we are a member, or we must reject the intuition that it is morally impermissible to disobey a decision made by a group of which we are not a member. Brownlee argues that the former view is too restrictive, so she adopts the latter. According to Brownlee, it is justified to disobey a decision made by a group of which one is a member if the decision is unjust. However, it is not justified to disobey a decision made by a group of which one is not a member. On this view, both the Group Obedience Puzzle and the Individual Obedience Puzzle have a solution. Brownlee has an interesting argument to justify her conclusion about the Individual Obedience Puzzle. In the Individual Obedience Puzzle, Brownlee claims, there is no reason to treat the individual any different than the group. Therefore, Brownlee claims, it is justified for the group to disobey the decision.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "In our series of letters from African-American journalists, film-maker and columnist Tavis Smiley looks at a new theory of civil disobedience that argues that disobedience in opposition to government decisions is justified."}

The survey did not ask about a laundry list of issues, only the single most important issue. Given the ongoing partisan politics surrounding the Affordable Care Act (ACA), one might have expected that a healthy majority of small business owners would have pointed to the healthcare law as their most pressing issue. That was not the case. \"The Affordable Care Act ranked as the most important issue for only 10 percent of the small business owners surveyed,\" said NFIB President Dan Danner. \"That was the lowest percentage in the past four years, and the percentage continues to decrease.\" In fact, the top most important issue identified in the survey was the need for more qualified workers. Twenty-eight percent of small business owners surveyed pointed to this as the most pressing issue. \"It is the highest percentage for this issue in the history of the survey,\" said Danner. \"For the past 30 years, the NFIB has been surveying small business owners, and this was the first time that the need for qualified workers ranked as the number one most important issue. It's also notable that the need for qualified workers was the top issue among all age groups of small business owners.\" The second-most important issue identified was the economy and jobs. Nineteen percent of small business owners selected this as their top issue. Other issues were immigration (4 percent), taxes (10 percent), government regulations (10 percent), healthcare (10 percent), and high taxes (8 percent). \"When asked about what specific policies they would like to see implemented by Congress, small business owners overwhelmingly said they want Congress to pass legislation that would spur economic growth,\" said Danner. \"Specifically, they pointed to tax reform and regulatory relief as the best ways to help the economy grow.\" Danner also noted that 63 percent of small business owners surveyed believe the economy is on the wrong track. \"Without question, small business owners are very concerned about the future of the economy,\" he said. \"Their concerns are not simply about their own business. They're concerned about the overall health of the economy and the impact that will have on their employees, their communities, and their nation. Small business owners are very thoughtful about the future and are making plans for how to keep their businesses viable for years to come. They're concerned about the future of their employees, their communities, and the nation.\" Bill Brunelle, an owner of Old Town Canoe in Old Town, Maine, says he is concerned about the future of the economy and the impact that will have on his employees, his community, and the nation. \"I'm worried about the economy and I don't think Washington is doing anything to address that,\" he said. \"I think they're out of touch. I'm worried about people's jobs. When the economy is bad, we have fewer customers, which means we have less money to put back into the community.\" Brunelle says he also has concerns about the Affordable Care Act. \"The Affordable Care Act is causing us to offer fewer benefits, which is causing us to lose good people. We can't keep them because we can't afford to provide the benefits they want.\" Bill Berkheimer, owner of Bills Bike and Run in Roanoke, Virginia, says he is also worried about the economy. \"The economy is not good right now,\" he says. \"The Affordable Care Act is affecting me as well. The cost of healthcare is rising, which affects me because I have to pay for it. I'm also seeing a big jump in payroll taxes, which is also affecting me.\" However, Berkheimer says that, despite the economy and the Affordable Care Act, his business is doing well. \"I'm doing really well,\" he says. \"I'm expanding into a new space that's twice the size of my current space.

{"original_text": "Many types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes, such as deterministic Turing machines, probabilistic Turing machines, non-deterministic Turing machines, quantum Turing machines, symmetric Turing machines and alternating Turing machines. Turing machines are a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed. The machine operates on an infinite memory tape divided into discrete cells. The machine positions its readwrite head over a particular cell of the tape and \"reads\" (scans) the symbol in that cell, then, based on the symbol and its internal state, the machine performs an action: either erasing the symbol and writing a new one, or moving the tape one cell to the left or right. The new state is thus calculated by a table of rules, or by a function (q, a), where q is the machine's state and a is the symbol being observed. The Turing machine is said to \"accept\" or \"reject\" the \"input\" (the entire tape contents at the start of the computation) when it halts. The Turing machine is a general purpose model of a CPU. A Turing machine is an abstract machine similar to a computer. A Turing machine can do anything that a real computer can do and is the basis for the Church-Turing thesis, which says that this is true of anything capable of computation. A Turing machine consists of a head, which can read and write symbols on a tape. A Turing machine has a state, and the state is changed after it reads a symbol and it does some computation based on the symbol and its current state. During each computation cycle, the machine is in a particular state and can move in a particular direction. The machine reads a symbol from the tape. The machine then performs an action determined by its state and the symbol. The machine then writes a new symbol and moves left or right. The machine starts in a certain state, called the start state. If the machine reaches an accept state, it is said to accept the input, and the computation halts. Otherwise, the computation never halts. The Turing machine accepts the input if it ever halts in an accept state. A Turing machine can be constructed from any set of rules. These rules are like a computer program. The rules are applied to the current state and symbol to compute the next state. The machine starts in a start state and halts when it reaches an accept state. The input is said to be accepted if the machine ever halts in an accept state. A Turing machine is a mathematical model of a computer. A Turing machine consists of a tape, a head, and a state. The tape contains the input. The head can read and write symbols on the tape. The state is the current state of the machine. The state is changed after each computation cycle. The tape is infinite in both directions. The machine reads the symbol at its current position. The machine then performs an action determined by its state and the symbol. The machine then writes a new symbol and moves left or right. The machine starts in a certain state, called the start state. If the machine reaches an accept state, it is said to accept the input, and the computation halts.

Egypt's subsequent governments have largely continued Sadat's policies. Egyptian officials are now concerned about terrorist groups in the Sinai Peninsula, which borders Israel and the Gaza Strip, and have increased security in the region. Egypt has a population of more than 88 million people, which means it has the largest population of any Middle Eastern country. Egypt's economy is heavily dependent on tourism, which provides more than 12 percent of the country's gross domestic product. Oil and gas exports also provide Egypt with revenues. Egypt is one of the 16 countries in the Middle East that are considered to be the most water-scarce in the world. Egypt's annual water deficit, which is the amount of water needed to meet all of the country's water demands but which is not available, is estimated to be more than 20 billion cubic meters per year. Egypt is the largest wheat importer in the world. Egypt has a rich cultural heritage, including the Pyramids, the Sphinx, and the world's largest outdoor sculpture, the Great Sphinx of Giza.

{"original_text": "The main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer T cells, sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells. Tumor antigens are molecules on the surface of tumor cells, such as proteins, that are recognized by the immune system. The problem is that tumors have ways to escape the immune system: Tumor cells can shut off expression of their antigens. Tumor cells can express proteins that prevent them from being recognized by the immune system. Tumor cells can turn off receptors that are required for the tumor cells to be recognized and killed by the immune system. Tumor cells can produce proteins that block the action of the immune system. Tumor cells can change their location to avoid the immune system. Tumor cells can send out chemical signals that prevent the immune system from getting to the tumor. Tumor cells can make substances that turn off the immune system. Tumor cells can spread to areas of the body where the immune system cannot get to them. Tumor cells can be present in small numbers and are not recognized by the immune system. Tumor cells can stimulate the immune system to kill healthy cells. Understanding how tumors are able to escape the immune system has led to the development of ways to make the immune system recognize tumors. This is known as immunotherapy. There are several different types of immunotherapy: Immunostimulants: These drugs stimulate the immune system so that it can recognize and destroy cancer cells. Immune modulators: These drugs change the way the immune system functions so that it can recognize and destroy cancer cells. Adoptive immunotherapy: The body's own immune system is trained to recognize and kill cancer cells. Cancer vaccines: These are substances that stimulate the immune system to destroy cancer cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors: These drugs interfere with the abnormal ways that tumors turn off the immune system. Monoclonal antibodies: These drugs are proteins that recognize and bind to cancer cells. Once the antibody binds to the cancer cell, it can be destroyed by other parts of the immune system.

Tumor antigens are molecules on the surface of tumor cells, such as proteins, that are recognized by the immune system. The problem is that tumors have ways to escape the immune system: Tumor cells can shut off expression of their antigens. Tumor cells can express proteins that prevent them from being recognized by the immune system. Tumor cells can turn off receptors that are required for the tumor cells to be recognized and killed by the immune system. Tumor cells can produce proteins that block the action of the immune system. Tumor cells can change their location to avoid the immune system. Tumor cells can send out chemical signals that prevent the immune system from getting to the tumor. Tumor cells can make substances that turn off the immune system. Tumor cells can spread to areas of the body where the immune system cannot get to them. Tumor cells can be present in small numbers and are not recognized by the immune system. Tumor cells can stimulate the immune system to kill healthy cells. Understanding how tumors are able to escape the immune system has led to the development of ways to make the immune system recognize tumors. This is known as immunotherapy. There are several different types of immunotherapy: Immunostimulants: These drugs stimulate the immune system so that it can recognize and destroy cancer cells. Immune modulators: These drugs change the way the immune system functions so that it can recognize and destroy cancer cells. Adoptive immunotherapy: The body's own immune system is trained to recognize and kill cancer cells. Cancer vaccines: These are substances that stimulate the immune system to destroy cancer cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors: These drugs interfere with the abnormal ways that tumors turn off the immune system. Monoclonal antibodies: These drugs are proteins that recognize and bind to cancer cells. Once the antibody binds to the cancer cell, it can be destroyed by other parts of the immune system. Following treatment with immunotherapy, patients are followed closely for side effects of the therapy.

{"original_text": "The game's media day, which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game, was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night. The changes were made to allow players to spend more time with family before the game, while increasing media availability for the week leading up to the game. The Patriots are the only franchise in the NFL with six Super Bowl appearances since 2001, winning four of them. The Falcons, meanwhile, had only made two Super Bowl appearances in their history, with the most recent coming in 1999. After the Patriots and Falcons won their respective conference championships, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that some Falcons players were not interested in the traditional media day for the Super Bowl due to the \"media circus\" that accompanies it. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy dismissed the idea, saying \"We are not considering any changes to the media day format or venue.\" However, the NFL later announced that the event would be held in Houston, Texas, at the George R. Brown Convention Center the day after the conference championship games. The event was rebranded as \"Super Bowl Opening Night,\" and was moved from the traditional Monday evening to the evening of the previous day. The Patriots became the first team in NFL history to win a Super Bowl after overcoming a deficit of at least 16 points in the third quarter (they were down 28-3 with 2:06 left in the third quarter), and the first team to overcome more than a 10-point deficit in the third quarter. The comeback was the largest comeback in the Super Bowl, and the third largest deficit overcome in the history of the NFL playoffs, after the 1950 NFL Championship Game and the 1993 AFC Wild Card Game. The Patriots are the first team since the 1980 Raiders to win a Super Bowl without having any players elected to the Associated Press All-Pro Team. The Patriots were the first team to overcome a deficit of 17 points to win the Super Bowl, and the first team to win the Super Bowl after trailing at halftime since the 1992 Dallas Cowboys. The Patriots and the Falcons made this the first Super Bowl to feature two teams that had never met in a regular season game. This was the first Super Bowl since Super Bowl X to not have a player named as MVP from the losing team. This was the first Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXXIX in which neither starting quarterback was named MVP. Patriots head coach Bill Belichick became the first coach to win five Super Bowls. He also tied Tom Landry and Curly Lambeau for the most NFL championships won by a coach with six. Belichick also tied Chuck Noll for the most Super Bowl wins by a head coach with five. This was the first Super Bowl to be a rematch of a previous Super Bowl (XI, XIII, XVII, XXVII, and XLVII). This was the first Super Bowl in which both teams entered the game undefeated since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001. Atlanta became the second city to host the Super Bowl at two different stadiums, after the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Atlanta became the fourth city to host the Super Bowl at two different stadiums, after the New York metropolitan area, the Los Angeles metropolitan area, and the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. The Super Bowl is traditionally held the first Sunday in February. However, in 2017, Super Bowl LI was played on February 5, because February 1 and 2 fell on a Sunday and Monday respectively. In addition, Super Bowl LII was moved to February 4, 2018, due to the 2018 Winter Olympics being held in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from February 9 to 25, 2018. Super Bowl LIII was then moved to February 3, 2019, in order to ensure a full week between the game and the opening ceremonies of the 2019 Winter Olympics, which will take place on February 8, 2019. The NFL also chose to move Super Bowl LIV to February 2, 2020, in order to ensure a full week between the game and the opening ceremonies of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which will take place on July 24, 2020.

{"original_text": "The addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation. Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the crest of a surface to migrate up-slope, while material on the toe of a slope moves down-slope. Deformational processes which have been active within the last 100 years are known as active deformation, while processes which have been active for thousands of years are known as passive deformation. These two types of deformation may occur simultaneously in the same area of the Earth's crust. Active deformation is driven by plate tectonics. Examples of active deformation in the modern day include faulting and folding of the crust (as occurs in the Himalayas), subduction of oceanic lithosphere (as occurs at the Japan Trench), and rifting (as occurs in the East African Rift Valley). Passive deformation is driven by the weakening of the lithosphere by erosion, and isostatic uplift. The process of erosion effectively removes mass from the Earth's crust and facilitates upward movement of a particular lithospheric block, while isostatic uplift occurs when a block of the crust cools to form a rigid lithosphere.

Passive deformation is a long-term process and often takes place over hundreds of millions of years. The Earth's crust is broken up into plates which are all moving relative to each other. This movement occurs through the process of plate tectonics. The crust and upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, and together with the asthenosphere, form the lithosphere-asthenosphere system (LAS). Plate tectonics is driven by the motion of the lithosphere in response to convection currents in the asthenosphere. The lithosphere is a strong, rigid outer layer of the Earth, and is divided into the seven major and many minor plates. These plates move relative to each other, with a maximum speed of 15 cmyr at the Mid-Atlantic ridge. Movement of the plates is driven by convection currents in the asthenosphere, which can be compared to a boiling pot of water. The rigid lithosphere is pushed along by the convection currents in the asthenosphere, which is a weaker part of the upper mantle. Convection currents occur within the asthenosphere when temperature differentials within the asthenosphere cause hot material to move upwards towards the surface, and colder material to sink downwards towards the Earth's core. The boundaries between the plates are known as plate margins, and along these margins, the relative movement of the plates results in deformation. In general, a plate margin may be classified as convergent, divergent, or transform. Convergent margins occur when two plates are pushed towards each other.

{"original_text": "Luther's hymns were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation. This behavior started with his learning of the execution of Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes, two fellow Augustinian monks. Luther and the Wittenberg reformers were horrified by the events and Luther wrote a hymn as a response. From that time on, Luther wrote hymns and songs to accompany many events in his life. Luther wrote these hymns for use in the worship services of the new church. He thought of hymns as a way to teach the laity the faith and to encourage their participation in the liturgy. His hymns were direct, simple and accessible to the people. Luther insisted that the hymns be written in the vernacular and set to simple tunes that would be easy to sing. This hymn was written in 1523 and it was originally titled \"A Hymn on the Anniversary of the Destruction of the Sacramentarians at Brussels.\" Luther wrote it in memory of two Augustinian friars, John Esch and John Voes, who were executed for heresy on July 1, 1523. At the same time he wrote this hymn, Luther also wrote two letters (one to George Spalatin and one to the Elector Frederick) explaining that Esch and Voes died for their faith. Luther's hymn and letters are still relevant today. In his letters, Luther stresses that the church is not about power or status. Rather it is about the witness to the truth and the importance of the Word of God. Luther's hymn, written in three stanzas, appears in many hymnals today. The English translation is found in the Lutheran Hymnal (1941), 327, in the Service Book and Hymnal (1958), 461, and in the Lutheran Book of Worship (1978), 297.

{"original_text": "The total number of seats in the Parliament are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method. The d'Hondt method is a mathematical method to allocate seats in party-list proportional representation systems. If a party gets 10 of the vote, then they will get 10 of the seats, or 10 of the total number of seats. If a party gets 20 of the vote, then they will get 20 of the seats, or 20 of the total number of seats. To determine who gets which seats, the party with the most votes gets the first seat. Then the party with the second most votes gets the second seat, and so on. A party could get 20 of the votes, but this does not mean that they will get 20 of the seats, because other parties could have been voted for first, and therefore get their seats first. The d'Hondt method has been widely criticized because it can produce results that are disproportional to the actual distribution of votes. This is because in the d'Hondt method, the relative strength of each party is not taken into account. For example, if two parties have the same percentage of votes, they will both get the same number of seats. This is the case in a real election, but in fact the seats should have been allocated proportionally to the number of votes received. For example, if Party A gets 45 of the votes and Party B gets 55 of the votes, Party A should get 45 of the seats and Party B should get 55 of the seats, not half of the seats each. Because of this, the d'Hondt method is widely regarded as a fairer method. However, the d'Hondt method has been criticized for creating disproportional results.

{"original_text": "In July 1968, ABC Radio launched a special programming project for its FM stations, which was spearheaded by Allen Shaw, a former program manager at WCFL in Chicago who was the consultant for ABC Radio. The project, called 'Stars of the Future', would allow ABC's FM stations to discover and play new, local artists in hopes that their records would become hits and break nationally. The project also allowed stations to showcase their own talents as music directors and program managers. The project was scheduled to last two months and the ABC network promised to pick a hit out of the program for nationwide play. The first week of the project had the ABC FM stations focus on the work of a single artist. The second week would feature work of two artists. The third week would feature an artist from each of the ABC FM stations, and the fourth week would include artists from the first three weeks. The fourth week in August featured the work of John B. Sebastian, 'King Bee' by the Doors, 'Walking the Dog' by Rufus Thomas, and 'The Way You Do the Things You Do' by the Temptations. In September, ABC-FM began using the project to determine which of the newly discovered artists would be featured in a monthly series of albums. The albums would be distributed by ABC-Dunhill Records. Artists who were featured in the album series included: Sweetwater, Rare Earth, Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes, and Pure Food Drug Act. In October, ABC announced that 'Stars of the Future' was one of the most successful and profitable promotion campaigns in the company's history. ABC's FM stations began playing cuts from the 'Stars of the Future' album series and they became the first FM station to use a computer to rate records. The success of 'Stars of the Future' led to a number of follow-up projects, including the 'Superstars of the Future' album series and 'Stars of the Future II' project. The 'Superstars of the Future' album series featured artists who were already stars on the ABC-FM stations and were expected to be hits nationally. Artists included: Eric Clapton, Janis Joplin, the Moody Blues, and Cream. The 'Stars of the Future II' project in 1970 focused on new artists, and included artists such as: Stevie Wonder, the Carpenters, the Isley Brothers, and B.B. King. The 'Stars of the Future' project did not have much of an impact on the national Top 40 charts, but it did have an influence on the Billboard Easy Listening chart. In the mid-1970s, the Easy Listening chart was being heavily influenced by easy rock artists like Bread, America, and Seals Crofts. When many of these artists started to crossover into the Top 40 and Hot 100 charts, many radio stations dropped their Easy Listening formats. In 1977, the Billboard Easy Listening chart was expanded to include pop and rock artists as well as easy listening artists. In 1978, the Easy Listening chart was renamed 'Adult Contemporary' and it was expanded to include any record that received spins on the AC chart.

More than 60,000 people were killed in Kabul alone, and 25,000 houses destroyed. In the chaos, many people joined the Taliban, a radical religious movement which took power in the mid-1990s. The Taliban claimed to bring peace to the country, but many Afghans - especially women - suffered under the extreme interpretation of Islam enforced by the Taliban, who banned women from working or going to school and subjected people to severe punishments for minor crimes. Following the 11 September attacks on the US in 2001, the US and its allies invaded Afghanistan. The Taliban were toppled in less than two months, but the US-led forces then became mired in a protracted conflict with the Taliban and other armed groups. A US-led military coalition overthrew the Taliban in 2001 for harbouring al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, blamed for the attacks on New York and Washington. Some 2,300 US soldiers have been killed since the start of the Afghan operation. Since 2001, at least 21,000 civilians have been killed and 40,000 injured, mainly by insurgents, according to the UN.

{"original_text": "The energy crisis led to greater interest in renewable energy, nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels. There is criticism that American energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by gas and oil companies. Crisis in the Middle East led to an oil embargo by OPEC in 1973. Gasoline rationing, even-odd rationing, long lines at gas stations, and a 55 mph (89 kmh) speed limit were enacted, while prices skyrocketed. Inflation in 1974 ran at 11.3, the highest since 1946. Unemployment reached 4.9 in May 1975, the highest since 1941. The value of the U.S. dollar declined significantly. During the 1970s, a combination of economic stagnation, growing inflation, and a growing dependence on foreign oil accompanied by the 1973 Oil Crisis and the 1979 energy crisis to cause a recession in 1974, and a longer lasting energy crisis in the late 1970s. The oil crisis of 1973 was a period when the price of oil rapidly increased in the United States. The crisis began in October 1973, when the members of OPEC refused to ship petroleum to the United States and other nations that had supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. The embargo caused the price of oil to soar from 3 per barrel to 12 per barrel. Gasoline was in short supply and stations limited how much gas they would sell to each customer. Even though the embargo lasted only a few months, gasoline rationing remained in place until August 1974. The embargo had a significant impact on the United States and other nations. The period marked the end of economic growth that had continued since the end of World War II. The Arab-Israeli conflict has been a major obstacle to a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace. Although peace was made between the Israelis and Egyptians, as well as Israelis and Jordanians, decades of violence between the Israelis and Palestinians continue to be a major obstacle to a comprehensive peace. There were a series of wars and conflicts, both between Israel and the Arab countries and internally within the Palestinian territories. The impact of the Arab-Israeli conflict on the Middle East region as a whole has been described as \"devastating\" and by some, such as Fouad Ajami as a \"disaster for the Arabs.\" The Arab-Israeli conflict has become the world's \"greatest intractable conflict.\" The Vietnam War was a Cold War-era proxy war that occurred in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from December 1956 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. This war followed the First Indochina War (1946-54) and was fought between North Vietnam - supported by the Soviet Union, China and other communist allies - and the government of South Vietnam - supported by the United States and other anti-communist allies. The Viet Cong (also known as the National Liberation Front, or NLF), a lightly armed South Vietnamese communist common front directed by the North, largely fought a guerrilla war against anti-communist forces in the region. The Vietnam People's Army (North Vietnamese Army) engaged in a more conventional war, at times committing large units into battle. U.S. and South Vietnamese forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations, involving ground forces, artillery, and airstrikes. The Vietnam War had a lasting impact on American politics. It was the only foreign war of the United States that attracted broad social opposition during wartime. It saw widespread civil unrest, including draft card burning and massive protests in addition to the killings that were carried out by a number of groups on all sides. One of the most influential anti-war and counterculture books in American history was written by an Army veteran Ron Kovic, titled \"Born on the Fourth of July.\" Numerous films have dramatized the Vietnam War, including \"The Green Berets\" (1968), \"Go Tell the Spartans\" (1978), \"The Deer Hunter\" (1978), \"Platoon\" (1986), \"Born on the Fourth of July\" (1989", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "The oil crisis of 1973 was a period when the price of oil rapidly increased in the United States, leading to rationing at gas stations, inflation, and a recession in 1974."}

{"original_text": "Some priests and former religious had already married, including Andreas Karlstadt and Justus Jonas, but Luther's wedding set the seal of approval on clerical marriage. He had long condemned vows of celibacy, seeing them as an example of works-based salvation, but had argued that priests who had already made such vows should not marry. The Elector was delighted to have arranged this for Luther, and the marriage was a cause for great celebrations. Luther preached a sermon in which he referred to marriage as 'the best and noblest estate of all', before taking his place in the procession, in which he was preceded by two children carrying lighted tapers. Catherine was twenty-six, and was said to have been a nun for a while, but this is almost certainly an embellishment of the story. She was of lower social status than Luther, and may have been brought to Wittenberg to work in the Black Cloister. She was intelligent, with a good sense of humour and an attractive personality, and was an excellent housekeeper. Within the marriage, Luther was the dominant partner, and this continued to be the case, but he clearly respected his wife's views and took her advice seriously. They had six children, and she managed the household brilliantly. She was also a writer, whose hymns are still sung. The marriage was exceptionally happy, but was not without its difficulties. Luther's condemnation of the Mass in 1522 was directed against the idea of the Mass as a sacrifice, but also took issue with the idea of the Real Presence. This meant that he was attacking the doctrine of transubstantiation, the teaching that during the Mass the bread and wine really become the body and blood of Christ. This was one of the beliefs that most offended Luther's sense of logic, and one that his opponents thought was at the heart of Protestant heresy. They were angered that he could so easily deny such a central part of the teaching of the Church, and criticised him for not providing a clear definition of what was meant by 'This is my body'. Luther's comment that he could believe what he liked so long as his reason was not offended was interpreted as a piece of arrogant self-assertion. In this, as in many other respects, Luther was way ahead of his opponents, but it would take some time before they caught up with him. He was also aware that there would be problems within his own camp, and he was right. In 1524, Andreas Bodenstein von Karlstadt, a professor of theology at the university, took issue with Luther over the doctrine of transubstantiation. This was partly because Karlstadt found it difficult to accept the idea that the bread and wine were transformed in the course of the Mass, but was also because he wanted to attack the Mass as a sacrifice, and saw this as the place to do it. He claimed that the bread and wine remained unchanged, and said that as Christ was present everywhere, the sacrament should be administered by a layman. He also said that the Mass should not be celebrated in Latin, but in German. Luther argued against this, but Karlstadt pressed his claims in a series of pamphlets, and was backed up by a group of radicals at the university and in Wittenberg itself. Karlstadt's views were condemned by Luther, and the issue was referred to the Elector for a decision. Luther believed that the Mass should be celebrated in Latin, because that was what had been prescribed by the Church, and it was still the language of theology. He also said that the Mass should be celebrated by a priest, and that the elements should be treated with reverence, and he said that the bread and wine were the body and blood of Christ. Karlstadt was dismissed from his post at the university, and Luther preached a series of sermons denouncing his views. Karlstadt's supporters were banned from Wittenberg, and he himself fled to Switzerland. There he continued to develop his ideas, and in 1525 published a work entitled On the Ban , which attacked the worship of images and the practice of fasting. His views were more radical than Luther's, and he had the support of some of the Swiss reformers, notably Ulrich Zwingli.

These codes are usually enforced by the local or state building authority. In the United States, NFPA 101 is the national model fire code that localities adopt. These codes govern building design, construction, and use. Local building authorities such as local planning departments or building inspection departments are responsible for enforcing building codes and for issuing permits to begin construction. Working with a local building official early in the design process helps to ensure that the proposed design is in compliance with applicable codes. Before beginning construction of the project, a building permit must be obtained. In the United States, the International Building Code (IBC) is the most widely adopted building code. IBC is a model code, which means that it serves as a template for the local building code, which is usually adopted by reference in local ordinances. The building code is enforced by the local building authority, such as the local building inspection department. A building permit is required for any construction, including a new home, an addition to an existing home, remodeling, or demolition. A building permit application must be submitted to the local building department, and the application must include drawings, calculations, and other documentation that describe the work to be done. A building permit application may require the seal of a registered design professional such as an architect, engineer, or building official. If a registered design professional seals the permit application, the professional is responsible for ensuring that the design meets the requirements of applicable codes. The professional may consult with other engineers or specialists who have expertise in certain areas. To ensure the safety of the occupants and the public, building code enforcement is critical. A well-designed building is not safe if the building is not constructed in compliance with the building code. One reason that a building permit is required is to ensure that the design is built as intended, and that construction is monitored by a qualified building official to ensure compliance with the building code. Another reason for building code enforcement is to ensure that building officials understand the building and the systems within it, and to ensure that the building is prepared for emergency situations, such as fires and natural disasters. As a registered design professional, it is my responsibility to design a project in compliance with the building code and to ensure that the project is constructed in compliance with the building code. This is a responsibility that I take very seriously, and one that I take pride in. I do not take shortcuts, and I strive to ensure that every detail of a project is carefully considered. I am a responsible design professional.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Building codes and regulations set minimum standards for the design and construction of a building or other structure, such as a shopping mall, office building, or residential home."}
{"original_text": "The Upper Rhine region was changed significantly by a Rhine straightening program in the 19th Century. The rate of flow was increased and the ground water level fell significantly. Dead branches and trunks were transported further downstream. The reduction of water retention areas and water plants led to a rise in water temperature. The meanders were straightened and the course of the Rhine became shorter. 40,000 ha of wetlands were lost and many fish species disappeared. The Upper Rhine was ecologically dead. With the Rhine's straightening, the migration routes of the fish were interrupted. Furthermore, the water quality deteriorated and led to a drastic reduction in the number of species of fish. The ecological balance was disturbed. The straightening of the Upper Rhine led to a decline in the numbers of the fish species that were important for the ecosystem. The Upper Rhine was in danger of becoming ecologically dead. In the 1970s, the EU launched a rescue program. The international waterway was being made into a \"Rhine with a thousand faces.\" The first fish passages were built. Water plants were reintroduced. The river banks were renaturalized. These measures created habitats for numerous animals, especially fish. Since 1975, the European Union has been investing in the ecological restoration of the Rhine. The Upper Rhine was among the first restoration projects. As a result, the ecological balance has been restored. Fish are once again migrating from the sea into the heart of Europe. The populations of many fish species have grown significantly. The number of fish species has risen from 40 in the 1970s to 76 today. The Rhine now has a high diversity of species. The Rhine is now navigable again for the fish. A total of 11 fish passages were built in the Upper Rhine. They help the fish overcome the barriers and continue their journey. Many fish species have found new habitats in the Upper Rhine. This is good for the ecological balance of the river. The number of species has risen from 40 in the 1970s to 76 today. Many fish species that were on the verge of extinction have recovered their populations. The Upper Rhine is now a hotspot for fish. The ecological restoration of the Upper Rhine is one of the most successful projects in Europe. The fishing areas have been expanded significantly. The Upper Rhine is once again a valuable recreational area. The improvement in the water quality has also increased the attractiveness of the Upper Rhine for recreation. The banks of the Upper Rhine are now a popular recreational area. Many residents of the Upper Rhine region like to go fishing here. As part of the ecological restoration of the Upper Rhine, the banks have been renaturalized. The Upper Rhine is a popular area for sports fishing, recreational fishing and fishing from a boat. The Upper Rhine is a popular destination for day-trippers and excursions. For a long time, the Upper Rhine was regarded as ecologically dead. It has now become a hotspot for fish.

{"original_text": "Despite being relatively unaffected by the embargo, the UK nonetheless faced an oil crisis of its own - a series of strikes by coal miners and railroad workers over the winter of 1973-4 caused widespread power cuts and eventually brought down the Conservative government. The crisis also exposed deep fault lines in the British economy. British industry had been in decline since the 1960s, and Britain had become a net importer of food and manufactured goods. In the face of the oil crisis, the British government tried to reduce the country's dependence on oil by cutting its use of petroleum products. But this only exacerbated the problems for the British economy. Britain's coal mines were inefficient, and mechanisation was largely restricted to the pits' surface facilities. Coal miners were organised in powerful unions, which effectively resisted government attempts to cut coal subsidies. But with oil prices rising, the government decided to impose a three-day week in 1974, in order to conserve power. A state of emergency was declared, electricity supplies were restricted, and the police were given emergency powers. The three-day week was finally lifted in January 1975, but even then the problem was far from over. A series of strikes by coal miners throughout the winter of 1974-5 led to widespread power cuts, and forced the government to use troops to help move coal supplies around the country. The crisis caused the government to fall, and on February 4th 1974 the UK faced its first ever national election in February.

{"original_text": "Most species are hermaphrodites - a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning it can fertilize its own egg, not needing a mate. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which are both sexes at the same time; some are sequential hermaphrodites, which start out as one sex and then change to the other. Some have both male and female organs, but they are not fully functional as both sexes. When a hermaphrodite and a male mate, their offspring can be either male or female, depending on the genetics of the parents. In some species, all the offspring are female. These females reproduce by cloning, since they don't need a mate. Some animals are parthenogenic - females can reproduce without mating. The eggs can have genetic mutations, so that each female may have slightly different offspring. Some species have sex determination, where the sex of the offspring is determined by environmental factors (e.g., temperature, available food). Some animals can change their sex, depending on the needs of the group. Some species have \"gynodioecy\" - a hermaphrodite and a male will mate, but the male's sperm will fertilize only the female's eggs, not her own. Some species can change sex during their lifespan. Some animals reproduce by asexual budding, which does not involve sexual reproduction. Some species are all male or all female. Some organisms reproduce without sex. Some species have haplodiploid sex determination - the males are haploid (one set of chromosomes), the females are diploid (two sets of chromosomes). Some animals can change their sex over their lifespan, or under certain conditions. Some animals have homosexual sex. Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of two gametes (sex cells) to form a zygote (fertilized egg). The zygote divides by mitosis into a multicellular individual. The fusion of the gametes usually takes place in a specialized structure within one of the individuals, such as the flower of the angiosperms, or within the body cavities of animals. The sex cells are produced in multicellular structures called gonads. When the sex cells are produced, they undergo a special form of cell division called meiosis, which reduces the number of chromosomes by half, so that the resulting cells are haploid. In sexual reproduction, the male gametes are called sperm, and the female gametes are called eggs or ova. In most sexually-reproducing organisms, each individual has two sexes, which are called male and female. In some species, some individuals can function as one sex, and others can function as the other sex. In some species, a single individual functions as both sexes. In some species, the male and female functions are not clearly defined. Most animals (including humans) have two different sexes (male and female). Some animals have a single sex. Some animals have both sexes at the same time. Some animals change sex. Some animals can have any sex, depending on the needs of the group. Some animals can have sex with the same sex. In some species, a single organism can change its sex over its lifetime. Most animals have two sexes (male and female). Some animals have a single sex (hermaphrodite). Some animals have both sexes at the same time. Some animals can change their sex, depending on the needs of the group. Some animals can have sex with the same sex. Some organisms have both sexes at the same time (hermaphrodite). Some organisms have one sex when they are young, and the other sex when they are adults. Some organisms can change their sex under certain conditions. Some organisms can have sex with the same sex. Many of the terms used to describe gender and sex are outdated. Some people may identify themselves as transgender. Some people may not identify as either male or female. Some animals have both male and female organs, but they are not fully functional as both sexes. Some animals are parthenogenic - females can reproduce without mating. Some species have gynodioecy - a hermaphrodite and a male will mate, but the male's sperm will fertilize only the female's eggs, not her own. Some organisms reproduce by budding, which does not involve sex. Some species have haplodiploid sex determination -", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "A hermaphrodite is an animal with two ovaries, one male and one female, which can produce both male and female offspring, depending on the genetics of the parents."}
{"original_text": "A regulation of the Rhine was called for, with an upper canal near Diepoldsau and a lower canal at Fussach, in order to counteract the constant flooding and strong sedimentation of the watercourse. On December 12, 2000, the St. Gall Canton council agreed to the construction of a lower canal with a total cost of CHF 105 million. The project was designed by the Federal Waterways Administration. The general contractor was the joint venture Locher Parking, Implenia, Marti, Stucky, and Linth AG. In February 2003, the construction work was started. The work included the construction of three weirs, a 3.7 km long main channel, the construction of two pumping stations, and the construction of three compensation basins. On May 25, 2007, the new regulation was inaugurated. The new channel has a capacity of 400 ms and a total length of 3.7 km. The lower canal is 3.7 km long and connects the existing 8 km-long upper canal with the River Rhine. The channel was constructed by a joint venture of three companies. The work included the construction of three weirs, a 3.7 km long main channel, the construction of two pumping stations, and the construction of three compensation basins. The main channel was cut into a soft rock using controlled blasting. The rock was excavated by blasting and hydraulic pumping. The channel is 20 m wide and 7 m deep and has a capacity of 400 ms. The Rhine River is separated into an upper and lower channel. The upper channel is 8 km long and 120 m wide. It is located at Diepoldsau, the location of the old waterway.

Humans acquire plague through the bite of a rodent flea that is carrying plague bacteria or through direct contact with an infected animal or human. Untreated, plague can be rapidly fatal. Early treatment is essential. Symptoms of bubonic plague include fever, headaches, chills, and weakness. These symptoms can appear suddenly and can be accompanied by painful, swollen lymph nodes (buboes) in the groin, armpits, or neck. Pneumonic plague is the most serious form of the disease. It is an advanced infection that is transmitted through droplets in the air and has a short incubation period. Symptoms include high fever, vomiting, and a cough that can produce bloody sputum. Septicemic plague is another serious form of plague and occurs when plague bacteria multiply in the blood. Symptoms include fever, chills, abdominal pain, and shock. Rapid antibiotic treatment is essential to prevent death from plague. Antibiotics can prevent the disease from developing in people who have been exposed. Plague is endemic in Madagascar. In 2017, there were 449 cases and 57 deaths reported, with 66 of cases reported in the capital, Antananarivo. In 2018, there were 2,560 cases and 211 deaths reported, with 77 of cases reported in Antananarivo.

Establishing \"natural borders\" on the Rhine was a long-term goal of French foreign policy, and Napoleon was able to achieve this goal in 1805, when he annexed the Duchy of Baden. The Upper Rhine became the new border between France and Germany, and the Rhine was \"liberated\" from the Rhine bailiffs who had ruled the river since the Middle Ages. The Rhine also became an important shipping lane, as the French began to construct and expand ports on the Rhine. After the defeat of Napoleon, the 1815 Congress of Vienna reestablished a territorially weakened France, and in 1816 the Rhine was again demarcated as a border. However, the 1815 Congress of Vienna also created the German Confederation, in which the entire Upper Rhine was incorporated. During the nineteenth century, the French-German conflict over the Rhine became one of the central issues of European politics. When the German states founded the North German Confederation in 1867, the Rhine became the border between the Confederation and the Kingdom of France. The Franco-Prussian War of 187071 ended with the founding of the German Empire and the Rhine became a border of the new empire. The French desire for revenge and the German fear of a new French invasion led to the construction of the fortifications of the Upper Rhine. The Rhine lost its significance as a commercial waterway in the late nineteenth century, when the railways gradually replaced the Rhine as a shipping lane. The Treaty of Versailles granted the territories of Alsace and Lorraine to France. The German-French border was reestablished as a demilitarized zone, in which all fortifications were to be dismantled. With the German invasion of France in May 1940, the French-German border was re-established on the Rhine. This border was fixed in the Armistice of Compiegne in June 1940. The Wehrmacht occupied the entire left bank of the Upper Rhine, the so-called CdZ-Gebiet, and the right bank of the Rhine was occupied by French Vichy troops.

{"original_text": "Luther and his colleagues introduced the new order of worship during their visitation of the Electorate of Saxony, which began in 1527. They also assessed the standard of pastoral care and Christian education in the parishes. Their findings were alarming. In many parishes the pastors did not understand Latin and so were unable to conduct the Mass or preach a sermon. In addition, most people could not afford to buy missals, so few of the congregation knew even the most basic liturgical prayers by heart. The reformers responded by producing a simplified order of worship that could be used by every parish. This included the celebration of two communion services each Sunday, a service of the Word at 7am and the celebration of the Eucharist at 9am or 10am. The main focus of Luther's liturgical reforms was the sermon. He believed that God speaks to us through the word of the Bible, and that hearing and understanding that word is therefore the most important aspect of our encounter with God. Luther preached most Sundays, and he was the main author of the sermons that appeared in the new order of worship. The publication of the order of worship was controversial, however. It was not the business of a prince to interfere with the divine order of worship. That was the prerogative of the pope. Luther's response was that his reforms were not new, but simply a return to the practices of the apostles. The churches of the Reformation were not only reformed in worship, but also in church government. They were based on the principle of the 'priesthood of all believers'. This meant that they did not have bishops who had inherited their office from the apostles. Instead, the congregation elected their pastors. Within a few years of the Reformation beginning, there were calls for the churches to be reformed in other ways, too. In 1523, Andreas Karlstadt, one of Luther's colleagues at Wittenberg, argued that the veneration of saints, relics and images, as well as the exclusion of women from the church and the banning of the Bible from the laity, were all unbiblical and needed to be abandoned. He also believed that some aspects of traditional Christian morality were wrong, and that this needed to be addressed by the church. There were other reformers who agreed with some of Karlstadt's criticisms, but did not like his radicalism. They formed a group known as the 'Philipists', who promoted a more moderate approach to reform. Their opponents, who called themselves 'Gnesio-Lutherans' (meaning 'true Lutherans, thought that the Philipists were too conservative, and that they were not as committed to the Reformation as they should be. The Reformation in Germany was not a single movement, but a series of debates and arguments among a number of different individuals and groups who shared a common commitment to reform, but had different ideas about what that meant in practice.

Luther preached most Sundays, and he was the main author of the sermons that appeared in the new order of worship. The publication of the order of worship was controversial, however. It was not the business of a prince to interfere with the divine order of worship. That was the prerogative of the pope. Luther's response was that his reforms were not new, but simply a return to the practices of the apostles. The churches of the Reformation were not only reformed in worship, but also in church government. They were based on the principle of the 'priesthood of all believers'. This meant that they did not have bishops who had inherited their office from the apostles. Instead, the congregation elected their pastors. Within a few years of the Reformation beginning, there were calls for the churches to be reformed in other ways, too. In 1523, Andreas Karlstadt, one of Luther's colleagues at Wittenberg, argued that the veneration of saints, relics and images, as well as the exclusion of women from the church and the banning of the Bible from the laity, were all unbiblical and needed to be abandoned. He also believed that some aspects of traditional Christian morality were wrong, and that this needed to be addressed by the church. There were other reformers who agreed with some of Karlstadt's criticisms, but did not like his radicalism. They formed a group known as the 'Philipists', who promoted a more moderate approach to reform. Their opponents, who called themselves 'Gnesio-Lutherans' (meaning 'true Lutherans, thought that the Philipists were too conservative, and that they were not as committed to the Reformation as they should be. The Reformation in Germany was not a single movement, but a series of debates and arguments among a number of different individuals and groups who shared a common commitment to reform, but had different ideas about what that meant in practice. It was a dynamic and creative process, that would go on to affect every aspect of German society in the sixteenth century."}

{"original_text": "Private schooling in the United States has been debated by educators, lawmakers and parents, since the beginnings of compulsory education in Massachusetts in 1852. The Supreme Court precedent appears to be that while states can regulate private schools, they cannot prohibit them. This report examines the arguments for and against regulation and concludes that the arguments against it are stronger. Education is the key to America's future. We know that education is important in preparing us to become the skilled, productive workers of tomorrow. It is also important in enabling us to function as informed citizens. Education is the key to America's future. We know that education is important in preparing us to become the skilled, productive workers of tomorrow. It is also important in enabling us to function as informed citizens. Education is crucial to our success in an ever-more competitive world. American business leaders have long argued that public schools have failed to prepare students for the workforce. Although students graduating from American high schools have achieved some of the highest reading, math, and science test scores in the world, employers complain that they cannot find enough people with the right skills. Many believe that businesses would be more willing to hire high school graduates if they had more training in basic skills, such as reading, writing, and math. The problem is not that American students are unintelligent. The average American high school student is quite capable of learning all of the basic skills that he or she will need in a career. The problem is that American schools are not giving them the education they need. Instead of training students to be the best workers in the world, they are turning out graduates with mediocre skills, and then expecting American businesses to train them in the skills they need to succeed in the workforce. Several factors may be at work in this educational failure. Some argue that the U.S. education system is simply too large and unwieldy. Many other countries have educational systems that are decentralized and locally controlled. Many of these countries also have national curriculum guidelines that local educators are free to tailor to the needs of their communities. In the U.S., however, local school boards are required to follow detailed state and federal curriculum mandates. Some of these mandates are well-intentioned. They ensure that schools prepare students for the challenges of the 21st century. However, they also place a huge burden on local school boards to adhere to state and federal standards. School boards that do not follow these standards risk losing federal funding or facing lawsuits from the federal government. This limits their freedom to adapt to local needs, and it increases their costs as they struggle to follow federal mandates. Students in many European countries attend a variety of different schools. In the Netherlands, for example, families can choose among a variety of different schools that are free, publicly funded, and locally controlled. There are more than 7,000 different schools in the Netherlands, and more than half are private. More than 75 percent of Dutch children attend private schools, which are subject to rigorous government standards but are given the freedom to set their own curricula. Unlike most private schools in the U.S., private schools in the Netherlands do not charge tuition. They are funded by a voucher system in which the government allocates an amount of money equal to what it spends per student in a public school. Families are free to use these vouchers to pay for a private school of their choice. Vouchers have proven to be an effective way to give families a voice in their children's education. They also give private schools the freedom to tailor their curricula to the needs of students. In the U.S., private schools are often subject to the same regulations as public schools. This gives parents a limited choice of schools that are all forced to comply with the same standards. While many of these standards are well-intentioned, they do not take into account the needs of different students. Some students need a more rigorous curriculum. Others need one that is more flexible and personalized. Some students are best suited to an environment where they can receive a lot of one-on-one attention. Others do better in a structured classroom. All students learn differently, and all students need a customized education. Unfortunately, many American schools are not able to provide this level of personalization. In large public schools, it is difficult for teachers to give individual students the attention they need. In schools that are too small, there is not enough diversity to prepare students for the realities of a multicultural world.

Victoria's parliament, a bicameral legislature, consists of a lower house, the Legislative Assembly (or House of Assembly), and an upper house, the Legislative Council (or Legislative Assembly). The Legislative Assembly has 88 members, each elected for four-year terms from single-member constituencies. The Legislative Council has 49 members, elected from eight multi-member constituencies, each of which returns five members elected by proportional representation. The Parliament of Victoria has its origin in the 1850s. It was elected in 1851, when Victoria was still part of the colony of New South Wales, but in 1856, under the new Constitution, the colony of Victoria was granted self-government. The Constitution established two Houses of Parliament: the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council. The Legislative Assembly is sometimes called the lower house"}

Since 1954 the Brotherhood has generally renounced violence, but some elements are accused of violence today in Egypt and elsewhere. In the United States, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has sometimes been accused of being a front organization for the Brotherhood. CAIR denies this, saying it is an independent organization. The Brotherhood has been active in Libya and Tunisia for decades, and in 2011 it attempted to take over those governments after the uprisings. In 2011 it won 47 percent of the vote for parliament in Egypt, and in 2012 it won the presidency. It is still the largest single party in Egypt. In Turkey, the government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan is often described as Islamist, though it is more Islamic than Islamist. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) was founded in 2001 by Islamists, but it won power in 2002 by promising to respect Turkey's secular constitution. The AKP was re-elected in 2007 and 2011, and then Erdogan was elected president in 2014. It has been accused of increasingly subverting the constitution and the rule of law. The AKP's government also supports the Muslim Brotherhood and has, for example, condemned the Egyptian government for cracking down on the Brotherhood. Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Somalia have been the main battlegrounds in the war against al-Qaeda and its associated movements. As noted above, al-Qaeda was founded in 1988 by Osama bin Laden, a millionaire from a wealthy Saudi family. It quickly became the most active and notorious terrorist organization in the world. In 1998 it bombed the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing over 200 people. In 2000 it was involved in the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen. But its most notorious action was the attack on New York and Washington on September 11, 2001. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. special forces in May 2011. The Taliban is a Sunni Islamist movement that ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. When it was in power, it carried out extreme punishments, including stoning and amputation. It also provided sanctuary for al-Qaeda and other terrorists. The Taliban was forced out of power by the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, but it continued to fight and today controls more territory than at any time since the invasion. Hezbollah is a Shiite Islamist movement and political party in Lebanon that was founded in the 1980s in response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Its military wing has engaged in terrorism against Israel and the United States, including the 1983 bombing of the U.S. embassy and the 1984 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. Hezbollah has also fought against Israel and other groups in Lebanon. It is funded by Iran, and has sent its fighters to aid the regime of Bashar al-Assad in the civil war in Syria. Hamas is a Sunni Islamist organization that was founded in 1987 in the Gaza Strip. Its military wing is believed to have carried out many terrorist attacks, including the 2004 bombing of a bus in Jerusalem, and rocket attacks on Israel. Hamas has engaged in power struggles with Fatah and other groups in Gaza, and has fought a war against Israel. It was elected to lead the Palestinian Authority in 2006 but was ousted from power in 2007 by Fatah. It retains control over the Gaza Strip, which it has ruled since 2007.

Newton was limited by Denver's defense, which sacked him seven times and forced him into three turnovers, including a 63-yard interception return by Von Miller for a touchdown. Manning said afterward that he will take some time before deciding whether to retire. The Carolina Panthers came into the Super Bowl with a 15-1 record and had won their previous 10 games by an average of 13 points. The Denver Broncos, who were 12-4 in the regular season, entered the game with one of the best defenses in the NFL. 1. Peyton Manning became the first quarterback to win Super Bowls with two different teams. He previously won with the Indianapolis Colts, who drafted him first overall in 1998. 2. Carolina's Cam Newton became the first quarterback to throw for 300 yards and rush for 50 yards in a Super Bowl, but he also threw two interceptions, including one that was returned for a touchdown. He was sacked six times and fumbled twice. 3. Denver's Von Miller had a sack, forced a fumble, and returned an interception for a touchdown in the first half. He tied a Super Bowl record with his three takeaways. 4. The Panthers set a Super Bowl record with 25 first downs. 5. Peyton Manning is the oldest quarterback to win a Super Bowl. The previous record was held by Tom Brady, who was 37 years old when the New England Patriots won Super Bowl XLIX last year. 6. The Denver Broncos have now won three Super Bowls, but they have never won back-to-back titles. 7. The Carolina Panthers had not played in a Super Bowl before last night. Their last appearance in an NFL championship game was in 1996, when they lost 30-13 to the Green Bay Packers. 8. The final score of Super Bowl 50 was the same as the final score of the 1993 NFC Championship game between the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers. 9. The Broncos have now played in eight Super Bowls, tying them with the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers for the most appearances. 10. This was the 50th edition of the Super Bowl, but the game was not actually called \"Super Bowl 50.\" That's because the NFL skipped Super Bowl 50, going straight from Super Bowl XLVIII to Super Bowl XLIX.

Ali Bhutto, a leftist in democratic competition with Islamists, had announced banning alcohol and nightclubs within months of coming to power in 1971. Zia-ul-Haq, however, was much more zealous in his attempts to Islamize Pakistan. He declared that he would rule the country by Sharia. He banned nightclubs, cinemas and alcohol and made Friday the weekly holiday. He also set up the Federal Shariat Court and the Council of Islamic Ideology to ensure that laws were Islamic. The Ahmadis were declared non-Muslims through a constitutional amendment, which was made possible through a mass movement launched by the religious parties against the community. Blasphemy was made a cognizable and non-bailable offense and \"enemies of the state\" were publicly hanged. When General Zia-ul-Haq died in an air crash in 1988, his Islamization project remained incomplete. This was the task of his successor, General Mirza Aslam Beg. In December 1988, General Beg issued the notorious 'Fatwa of the Army', which declared that jihad was obligatory for all Muslims. He also announced that Pakistan's nuclear weapons were made for use against the infidels. The following month, General Beg announced that he would rule by Sharia. In 1989, Pakistan's legislative body, the National Assembly, passed a constitutional amendment which declared that the objective of the constitution was the glory of Islam. In 1991, the Federal Shariat Court was empowered to strike down any law or legal instrument that was against the injunctions of Islam. The Sharia laws that were introduced in Pakistan were a mixture of various schools of Islamic law. Although in theory it was argued that the Sharia was not specific to any sect, in reality the laws that were implemented were specific to the Sunni Muslim majority. The Shia Muslim minority was left to fend for itself and in many cases was specifically targeted through the laws. For example, the prohibition of music and dance was specifically targeted at the Shia festival of Muharram, which is traditionally marked by drum beats and theatrical performances. Similarly, the prohibition on Alam (a flag used in Muharram processions) was specifically aimed at the Shia community. In 1992, the government of Pakistan began a campaign to register all the madrasas in the country. The reason for this was that the government felt that the curriculum of these institutions did not incorporate sufficient material on Pakistan's ideology. The country's ideology, it should be noted, was Islam. There were three main reasons for this concern. Firstly, Pakistan was facing an insurgency in its tribal belt which was being fought by jihadi groups. It was being argued that the jihadi groups were using these madrasas as recruiting grounds. Secondly, the military was facing a threat from its own ranks. There were several instances of soldiers' refusal to fight the jihadi groups. This was attributed to their being taught the concept of jihad in the madrasas. Thirdly, the Afghan jihad had polarized the society and the government was under pressure to bring the jihadi groups to heel. In 1993, the Pakistan government banned the use of loudspeakers for the purpose of religious sermons. However, this ban was subsequently lifted. In 1994, the Federal Shariat Court declared that women could not become judges. Women were not allowed to be judges in Saudi Arabia as well. In 1994, the National Assembly declared that Friday was the weekly holiday in the country.

In 1996, the government banned the television broadcast of Indian films. In 1997, the government banned the use of loudspeakers during religious festivals.

{"original_text": "With International Criminal Court trial dates in 2013 for both President Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto related to the 2007 election aftermath, US President Barack Obama chose not to visit the country this week, the first US President not to visit Kenya since independence. The White House released a statement that \"President Obama's decision not to travel to Kenya at this time reflects his commitment to encouraging the Kenyan government's continued progress on reforms and his concern about Kenya's failure to meet its international obligation to prosecute those responsible for the 2007-2008 post-election violence.\" Despite the bizarre and occasionally tone-deaf references to Kenya from Romney in the last US presidential campaign, I had imagined that Obama would be visiting Kenya as part of an African trip in 2013 or 2014, with the symbolism of a visit by the first African-American US President to his father's homeland, and with the \"winds of change\" Obama noted at a Cairo speech early in his presidency having reached Nairobi. On the other hand, my initial thought about the Obama-Kenyatta meeting at the White House in 2006 was that Obama was simply keeping his end of the bargain for the ODM strategy at the time which was for Raila to run for President and Kibaki to run for Prime Minister, and Obama, the future President, had to meet Raila, the future President. Thus I had expected the Obama visit to Kenya to be in connection with the Kenyatta-Ruto trial. But at the time of the meeting at the White House, even if there was a strategy for Raila to succeed Kibaki, Kenyatta and Ruto were still in the Kibaki camp. Thus it did not seem as clear that Obama should be making a commitment to Kenyatta. As you may recall, in 2006, Kenyans were still waiting to have the results of the 2005 referendum on the draft constitution ratified in a national referendum, which was later delayed until 2007. I remember Raila as a guest at a breakfast session at CSIS in Washington in 2006. The moderator was the late Ambassador Robert Houdek, who had been in Nairobi during the referendum and had a generally positive view of the process. I remember him asking Raila, \"Would you accept the results of the referendum?.\" Raila said, \"Yes, if I win,\" which the moderator could not let go without some comment about how Raila was not in the right spirit. The PNUODM coalition fell apart in 2006 and the 2007 elections were the most hotly contested in Kenya's history. After the contested election results, the ODM and PNU coalitions formed new, respectively \"Government of National Unity\" and \"Grand Coalition Government.\" As Obama prepares to visit South Africa in June, the Washington Post story from yesterday is headlined, \"Kenyans say Obama's absence from a visit to their country is a snub.\" The Obama administration has been criticized by some Kenyans and their political leaders for not visiting the country. Kenyans note that when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited in 2012, she was met by throngs of people and cheering crowds. Several polls indicate that Kenyatta's popularity has fallen after his election last year, and he faces the possibility of indictment by the International Criminal Court on charges of crimes against humanity for his alleged involvement in the violence that followed the 2007 election. The Post story also notes that in 2006, then-Sen. Obama was one of only four Senators to vote against a bill that would allow the United States to extend military aid to countries that had not signed the International Criminal Court treaty. Also the story says that \"U.S. law prohibits the government from providing assistance to any individual facing charges at the ICC.\" In a Time magazine article, \"U.S.-Kenya Relations: The Price of Democracy,\" Simon Robinson writes: The U.S. - Kenya's largest trading partner - has been careful not to criticize Kenyatta's government too openly, although it has raised concerns about the potential abuse of human rights.

According to Biraben, the plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671. The Second Pandemic of bubonic plague started in 1347 in the Crimea Tartar, today known as the Black Sea, and spread by ship across the Mediterranean and throughout Europe. The Black Death killed an estimated 75 million people. The Third Pandemic of plague started in China in 1855. It spread to India, the Caspian Sea region, and then to the rest of the world. More than 12 million people died. The Fourth Pandemic, which began in 1894, started in China and Hong Kong, spread throughout Asia and later to Africa, the Americas, Australia and the South Pacific. More than 10 million people died. The Third Pandemic, which began in China in the middle of the 19th century, spread to India, the Caspian Sea region, and then to the rest of the world. Bubonic plague was carried by infected rats and fleas to Canton, China, in 1855. In 1856, the disease spread to Hong Kong and then to southern China. In 1894, plague reached Bombay, India, and spread throughout the country. Between 1898 and 1901, the disease killed 1.5 million people. The pandemic reached Africa in 1900, and the Americas in 1900 and 1909. By 1911, it had reached Hawaii, New Zealand and Australia. Plague was brought to the Americas by ships carrying infected rats, which left the docks in Honolulu and San Francisco and carried the disease to other ports. Plague was transmitted from infected rats on ships to both Honolulu and San Francisco in 1900. Hawaii was able to contain the disease quickly, but San Francisco saw a large outbreak. In 1909, an outbreak in San Francisco led to 78 deaths. In 1911, the disease was brought to Los Angeles by ships. A few years later, it spread to the east coast by ships carrying infected rats. The Fourth Pandemic of plague, which began in 1894, spread to Africa, the Americas, Australia and the South Pacific. More than 10 million people died. According to WHO, the Fourth Pandemic was declared in 1909. The plague outbreaks were recorded in India, Manchuria, China, and South Africa. In 1899, plague reached Hong Kong, and by 1902 it spread to port cities in China. In 1903, it reached port cities in Japan, the Korean Peninsula and the Russian Far East. The disease spread to port cities in India, the Middle East and Africa between 1903 and 1907, and to port cities in the Western Hemisphere in 1909 and 1911. Plague is found in nature among rodents and their fleas. It is not known whether the plague originated in rodents or among humans, but it can be traced back as far as 2500 B.C. in Egypt. During the Middle Ages, millions of people died from plague in Asia, Africa and Europe. The Black Death, a pandemic that swept through Europe in the 14th century, killed an estimated 75 million people. The disease was transported by rats and fleas that lived on the rats. It was carried by ship from the Crimea to the Mediterranean and throughout Europe. In the United States, the first cases of plague were recorded in 1900, when sailors brought the disease to San Francisco from Hong Kong and Honolulu. The disease was not identified until 1907, when the chief health inspector for San Francisco correctly diagnosed the disease. In 1924, the cause of the disease was identified. The disease has killed 100 million people throughout history, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

{"original_text": "The Amazon rainforest (Portuguese: Floresta Amazonica or Amazonia; Spanish: Selva Amazonica, Amazonia or usually Amazonia; French: Foret amazonienne; Dutch: Amazoneregenwoud), also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle, is a moist broadleaf forest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 square kilometres (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60 of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13, Colombia with 10, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. States or departments in four nations contain \"Amazonas\" in their names. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species. The rainforest likely formed during the Eocene era. It appeared following a global reduction of tropical temperatures when the Atlantic Ocean had widened sufficiently to provide a warm, moist climate to the Amazon basin. The rainforest has been in existence for at least 55 million years, and most of the region remained free of savanna-type biomes at least until the current ice age, when the climate was drier and savanna more widespread.

Woodward Park, which features the Shinzen Japanese Gardens, numerous picnic areas and several miles of trails is in North Fresno and is adjacent to the San Joaquin River Parkway. Roeding Park, near Downtown Fresno, is home to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo, and Rotary Storyland and Playland. Kearney Park is the largest of the Fresno region's park system and is home to historic Kearney Mansion and plays host to the annual Civil War Revisited, the largest reenactment of the Civil War in the west coast of the United States. The City of Fresno offers 75 neighborhood and regional parks covering 2,500 acres (10 km2) throughout the city. These parks feature over 100 miles (160 km) of multi-use trails. The Fresno parks system has several properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and features several historic houses. Fresno is one of the first U.S. cities to use solar-powered trash compactors, which use solar energy to compact larger-sized trash cans, increasing their waste capacity. Fresno is also one of the first U.S. cities to use Megahome units that use solar energy to treat wastewater. The Fresno Municipal Sanitary Landfill was the first modern landfill in the United States, and includes one of the first modern leachate treatment systems in the nation. The San Joaquin River Parkway is a planned 22-mile (35 km) long parkway, presently estimated to cost 310 million, along the southern edge of Fresno. The planned parkway would connect the San Joaquin River Parkway to the Friant-Kern Canal Trail via 5 bridges. When completed, the parkway will connect with the Lewis S. Eaton Trail System. The City of Fresno has set aside over 200,000 for the project. In 2006, Fresno Mayor Alan Autry initiated a city-wide campaign to revitalize and invest in the local downtown community of Fresno. The campaign, called Fresno Prospers, focuses on a five-point plan to \"foster and improve the development, vitality and stability of Downtown Fresno as the region's civic core, entertainment center, employment and business center, and education core.\" As part of the Fresno Prospers initiative, the city purchased several buildings in the downtown area, including the Fresno Bee building, with the intent of transforming them into mixed-use developments. The Fresno Bee building, now called the Grand 1401, was purchased in 2007 and is currently undergoing renovation. In 2007, the city broke ground on a new 200 million, 800,000 square foot (74,000 m) Federal Courthouse in downtown Fresno to consolidate and improve the security of federal operations in the city. The Robert E. Coyle Federal Courthouse is expected to be completed in 2010. The city also purchased the Fulton Mall, with plans to reopen it to traffic and revitalize the downtown area. The 170 million Fulton Corridor Revitalization project, approved by the Fresno City Council in 2006, will demolish the Fulton Mall, replace it with two-way traffic, and construct high-density retail and residential buildings in the area. In October 2007, Mayor Autry announced a five-point economic development plan to create more jobs, attract more businesses, reduce traffic, and expand the Fresno economy.

Nearly 50,000 Huguenots established themselves in Germany, 20,000 of whom were welcomed by Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. In addition, 20,000 settled in the Lutheran cities and principalities of Baden, Franconia, and the Palatinate. Over 10,000 Huguenots emigrated to the Dutch Republic during the 16th and 17th centuries. They found refuge in Amsterdam, the cultural and economic centre of the Netherlands at the time. The Dutch Republic was the only place in Europe where Huguenots found full freedom of religion and could worship openly. At the end of the 16th century, Huguenots fled the French persecution and found refuge in Italy. The most important French-speaking community in Italy was founded by the weavers who were invited by Pope Clement VII in 1533 to work in the silk and wool manufactories in the region of Lucca, near Florence. This community of Protestants was protected by the grand dukes of Tuscany and the King of France. The community of Huguenots in Ireland formed in the 17th century. They were attracted by the religious tolerance of the English colony. The majority of Huguenots found refuge in Dublin, the country's largest city, but they also established settlements in Cork, Limerick, and Waterford. The Dutch Republic was the only place in Europe where Huguenots found full freedom of religion and could worship openly. Huguenots who settled in England were welcomed by Queen Elizabeth I in 1562, but it was under James I's reign that they were finally recognised as French citizens in England. Between 1685 and 1687, England welcomed more than 20,000 Huguenots. Some of them settled in London, but most of them established communities in Canterbury, the City of Rochester, and Norwich. In 1683, King Charles II of Spain issued the royal decree of \"the Pardo\" Pragmatica de las Cortes de Castilla which granted the Protestants of France the right to live and work in Spain. Many of them found refuge in the Basque Country and in Catalonia. In the mid-17th century, the royal court of Denmark-Norway granted asylum to several thousand Huguenots. The newcomers were welcomed by Christian IV, king of Denmark, and Frederick III, king of Denmark and Norway, who made several decrees in favour of the French Protestants. After 1685, Huguenot refugees spread all over Scandinavia. The Huguenots who settled in Sweden, in particular in the cities of Stockholm and Gothenburg, worked in the iron and steel industry. In Finland, Huguenots established a colony in the city of Turku, which became the capital of the country. The majority of Huguenots who fled France found refuge in the Holy Roman Empire, one of the largest European territories. Around 250,000 Huguenots were welcomed in the Lutheran states in the region of Brandenburg, Pomerania, Mecklenburg, and Silesia. The largest number of Huguenots settled in the Prussian cities of Berlin, Konigsberg, and Magdeburg. Huguenots also established communities in the Palatinate, Saxony, Hesse-Kassel, and Wurttemberg.

{"original_text": "Sociologist Jake Rosenfield of the University of Washington asserts that the decline of organized labor in the United States has played a more significant role in expanding the income gap than previously thought. According to Rosenfield, the diminishing influence of unions in the workplace has been compounded by an eroding support system for unions among the public, policymakers, and corporate leaders. In an article in the June 2010 issue of the American Journal of Sociology, Rosenfield argues that, although the decline in union membership has been long-established as a consequence of the economic restructuring that occurred in the United States from the 1970s onwards, this trend has been exacerbated by a growing social and political disdain for the labor movement. Rosenfield says the role of the \"right-to-work\" lobby in preventing unions from gaining a stronghold in the workplace has been significant. \"Right-to-work\" laws permit workers to enjoy the benefits of unionized labor without paying dues. In 1977, just 11.5 percent of private-sector workers were employed in right-to-work states. Today, the figure is 33.5 percent. Rosenfield further points to growing public distrust of unions as a reason for the decline. The Pew Research Center, for example, found that the percentage of Americans who believe that labor unions are too powerful rose from 16 percent in 1967 to 53 percent in 2009. \"The public debate over unions and union organizing in recent years has been particularly contentious,\" Rosenfield says.

The sacrament of marriage is a present proclamation of the eschatological reality of the Church as the Bride of Christ and the future marriage of the Lamb, a present participation in the joy of the resurrection. Marriage is the union of a man and a woman. God made us male and female. He commanded us to be fruitful and multiply. The marriage of man and woman is the only setting for sexual intercourse, that is, for the procreation and upbringing of children. This is the way God made us. It is not our right to change it. -St. John Chrysostom, Homilies on Ephesians, 20.2 A Christian marriage is the union of a baptized man and a baptized woman, consummated in sexual intercourse. It is a covenant between the spouses before God and the Church. It is intended by God to be indissoluble, and so should only be undertaken with the greatest care, and with the firm intention to remain faithful to one's spouse as long as both shall live. The sacrament of matrimony imparts the grace needed to live faithfully and chastely in marriage. Marriage is an icon of the relationship between Christ and his Church. \"For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. As the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands\" (Eph 5:23-24). Marriage is also an icon of the relationship between God and his people. He is the loving husband to his bride Israel, and Christ, the new Israel, is the bridegroom who gave himself up for his Church. The Church is also the bride of Christ, and Christ is the bridegroom. Christ is the divine bridegroom of the Church, as God said to Israel, \"I will take you for my wife\" (Hos 2:19), and as the Church sings, \"as a young man marries a virgin, so will your sons marry you; and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so will your God rejoice over you\" (Is 62:5). The Holy Scripture, which is completely inspired by God, says: \"From the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female. For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder\" (Mark 10:6-9). Marriage is a covenant between the spouses before God and the Church. It is a union of two persons, a man and a woman, both baptized in the Name of the Holy Trinity. It is intended by God to be indissoluble, and so should only be undertaken with the greatest care, and with the firm intention to remain faithful to one's spouse as long as both shall live. Those who marry should marry \"in the Lord\" (1 Cor. 7:39). They should marry for love, in the fear of God, not out of selfishness or mere desire, and with due consideration for the partner God gives them. The bond of marriage involves three relationships: 1) the relationship of the spouses to each other, 2) the relationship between them and their children, if God grants them any, and 3) the relationship between them and the community of the Church. As in baptism, there is a triple \"unity\" in marriage. The spouses become \"one flesh\" (Gen. 2:24). They beget \"one\" child, who then continues the existence of both parents. Finally, they enter into \"one\" relationship to the Church and to God. The family is the fundamental unit of society and is an icon of the Church. The family is the first school of Christian love. \"The love of husband and wife is the force that welds society together.

It was a tragedy that Mahfouz had lived for 14 years in his last years as a helpless invalid because of a knife attack by a fundamentalist Muslim in 1994. Mahfouz, who was a leftist in his younger days, did not mellow with age.

A 25-foot (7.6 m) high stone wall surrounded the town in the 13th century. The Scots king William the Lion was imprisoned in Newcastle in 1174, and Edward I brought the Stone of Scone and William Wallace south through the town. Newcastle was successfully defended in 1640 against a Scottish army during the English Civil War. The city had a number of English Civil War sieges and conflicts, including a 1644 siege by Scottish Covenanters. The city developed as a major coal mining area, and was a major centre of shipbuilding and manufacturing. Heavy engineering contributed significantly to the wealth of the city. In 1882, Newcastle became the seat of an Anglican diocese, with St Nicholas' Church becoming a cathedral. In the 19th century, the city developed as the home of William George Armstrong, Lord Armstrong, the successful Tyneside industrialist whose inventions transformed warfare and the manufacture of armaments. He built the first hydraulic cranes, which were installed on the quayside for unloading collier ships. This resulted in the city becoming a major shipbuilding centre. The population of Newcastle increased rapidly from 1801, as the city developed as the major coal mining area for the Industrial Revolution in Britain. The port developed in the Victorian era, being developed as a major centre for coal mining and export. By 1900, the city was the sixth most productive manufacturing centre in the United Kingdom. During World War II the city and surrounding area were bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe, suffering 163 air raids in the period 1939-45 and killing 1,141 people. In the post-war period the city's heavy industries went into decline and many jobs were lost. The 1980s saw large-scale regeneration in Newcastle, including the refurbishment of much of the city centre, the opening of the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, the opening of the MetroCentre, one of the UK's largest shopping centres, and the creation of the NewcastleGateshead Initiative, a joint venture between Newcastle City Council and Gateshead Council to develop the area's economy.

In the Middle Ages, thinkers such as John Philoponus applied the laws of Aristotle to objects in motion as well as to the heavens, but errors in understanding fundamental laws of force led to the adoption of \"epicycles\" by astronomers in order to explain retrograde motion. Buridan and Oresme, in the 14th century, were the first to discard the theory of Aristotle in favor of a more correct theory for the motion of projectiles. This was a major step in the evolution of the modern concept of force. Galileo first used the idea of inertia as describing the motion of objects that happen to be moving: objects that are moving (whether on the ground, or floating in the air, or in interplanetary space) tend to keep moving unless some force causes them to slow down or change direction. Isaac Newton explained this phenomenon by adopting the theory of inertia as a fundamental law of motion: in Newton's words, \"Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled by forces impressed upon it.\" While Newton originally used the term \"force\" to describe a cause of motion, he later cleared this up in his work \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy,\" saying that \"the causes I have assigned of the motion of the planets are gravity, regarding the sun as fixed in this treatise, and a certain inherent force, which is in the planet, and draws or drives it continually towards the sun.\" In this work Newton laid the foundation for what is now called \"classical mechanics.\" It was further developed by other scientists, notably by Pierre-Simon Laplace and William Rowan Hamilton. In classical mechanics, forces still appear in the same role today as they did in earlier times, as explanations of motion and changes in motion. In the 19th century, James Clerk Maxwell, Michael Faraday and others unified the theory of electricity and magnetism into one theory of electromagnetism. In their theory, the fundamental aspects of the forces of electricity and magnetism were seen to be much the same: both exhibited the properties of forces, namely that they can act on matter, transmitted via fields, and can be both attractive and repulsive. At the same time, the understanding of the weak force and strong force were improved, and in the 20th century the electroweak theory unified these two interactions with electromagnetism. Another major development of the 20th century was the introduction of the concept of the fundamental force of nature. In part, this was possible due to the use of Newtonian mechanics in building successful theories of electromagnetism and thermodynamics. In addition, the discovery of radioactivity and nuclear energy showed that the atom was not an elementary particle, but contained smaller constituents: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The electromagnetic force was seen to not only apply to protons and electrons, but to atomic nuclei as well. How was it possible that electrons and protons, considered elementary particles, were subject to a force (the electromagnetic force) while the atoms they formed were not? Early in the 20th century, attempts to answer this paradox led to the postulation of a new particle, the neutrino. However, this proved insufficient to explain the apparent loss of energy in radioactive decay, and the concept of a \"force carrier particle\" to transmit the force was formulated. This concept was refined to the modern concept of the gauge boson. Finally, through the work of Enrico Fermi, this particle was shown to be not an elementary particle, but a composite of other particles.

OPEC: A cartel of oil-exporting nations formed in the 1970s to regulate the production and price of oil. OPEC, founded in 1960, is an organization of oil-exporting countries that has its headquarters in Vienna, Austria. The current members of OPEC are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela. OPEC members account for about 40 of global oil production and 75 of the world's \"proven\" oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that has sometimes been controversial. The effect of OPEC's actions can be readily seen by examining the price of oil. The price of oil displayed a long decline from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s, and then a rapid increase to record highs in mid-2008. This price increase triggered a worldwide economic slowdown. The organization was founded in Baghdad, Iraq, by five countries, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela, and it was known then as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. In the 1970s the organization gained its current name and expanded to include Nigeria, Algeria, and Libya, and then in the 1990s, Qatar and Angola. Individual oil-exporting countries have also been known to try to exert their own influence on world oil prices, with the exporters' control over their internal supply generally increasing the price of oil. OPEC's largest producer Saudi Arabia is by far the largest exporter of petroleum in the world. OPEC was formed to unify and coordinate members' petroleum policies. Between 1960 and 1975 the organization expanded to include Qatar (1961), Indonesia (1962), Libya (1962), the United Arab Emirates (1967), Algeria (1969), and Nigeria (1971). Ecuador and Gabon were early members of OPEC, but Ecuador withdrew on December 31, 1992, because it was unwilling or unable to pay a 2 million membership fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed to under the OPEC quota. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995. Angola joined on the first day of 2007. Norway and Russia have attended OPEC meetings as observers. Individual members within OPEC do not always agree on the best course of action for world oil prices or how to distribute the organization's income. The first of the so-called \"oil shocks\" occurred in 1973. A few months after the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War, Egypt and Syria attacked Israel and oil-exporting countries in OPEC proclaimed an oil embargo against Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States, while Arab oil-producing countries also embargoed the United States. Oil prices skyrocketed, and many non-oil-producing countries experienced a major recession. OPEC's actions have also been criticized by other countries. In 2008, the members of the International Energy Agency, which had for years pressured OPEC to increase production to lower prices, accused the organization of not investing enough money in oil exploration. At the same time, there have been calls by American politicians for the federal government to sue OPEC for antitrust violations and treason. African Petroleum Producers' Association: The African Petroleum Producers' Association (or APPA) is an organization of African oil-producing countries.

Private schools are sometimes considered \"public\" because they are usually open to the general public, as opposed to schools restricted to the children of employees of a particular company or those admitted through selective entrance procedures. Admittance to some private schools is often competitive, or the private school may have a religious affiliation. Private schools are not subject to the same accountability or teacher certification requirements as public schools. Private schools are often relatively small when compared to other schools in the area, and this, along with other factors, can lead to higher teacher salaries and a lower teacherstudent ratio. These factors often translate into a superior educational experience when compared to public schools. Private schools also frequently offer a wide variety of extra-curricular activities in addition to a solid core academic program. They are also not subject to the same curriculum restrictions as public schools. One of the big advantages of private schools is the additional funds available for extracurricular activities. Private schools can also be more flexible when it comes to class size. If your child is particularly gifted in a certain area, you may find a private school that offers a curriculum that can challenge your child and further develop her or his talents. Some private schools offer accelerated academic programs, which may include advanced placement classes. Private schools may also provide more personal attention to individual students. The quality of education in private schools can vary widely. Private schools are not subject to the same accountability and teacher certification requirements as public schools. The tuition and other costs associated with a private school can be very high. The quality of private schools can vary widely. According to the U.S. Department of Education, private schools lag slightly behind public schools when it comes to funding per student. The average per-pupil expenditure in private schools in 2002-2003 was 6,601, compared to 8,783 for public schools. This is not surprising considering the fact that most private schools are not government funded. Public schools may offer more extracurricular activities than private schools. Private schools are often accused of being too expensive. Private schools may not be as diverse as public schools. Private schools may offer less extracurricular activities than public schools. There is a wide variety of private schools to choose from. You can find a school that caters to just about any interest you may have. There are private schools that specialize in art, science, math, music, foreign languages and more. There are also private schools that cater to students with special needs. If you can afford private school, you can choose one that best fits your child's needs. If your child is particularly gifted in a certain area, you may find a private school that offers a curriculum that can challenge your child and further develop his or her talents. Some private schools offer accelerated academic programs, which may include advanced placement classes. Private schools may also provide more personal attention to individual students. The quality of education in private schools can vary widely. According to the U.S. Department of Education, private schools lag slightly behind public schools when it comes to funding per student. The average per-pupil expenditure in private schools in 2002-2003 was 6,601, compared to 8,783 for public schools. This is not surprising considering the fact that most private schools are not government funded. Some of the best private schools can be very expensive. The tuition and other costs associated with a private school can be very high. Private schools may not be as diverse as public schools. Public schools may offer more extracurricular activities than private schools. Private schools may offer less extracurricular activities than public schools. Tuition and other costs associated with private schools can be high. Quality can vary from school to school. You may not be able to find a private school that caters to your child's interests. Some parents may be reluctant to send their children to a private school because they're concerned about the cost.

{"original_text": "The first Huguenots to leave France sought freedom from persecution in Switzerland and the Netherlands.[citation needed] A group of Huguenots was part of the French colonisers who arrived in Brazil in 1555 to found France Antarctique. A couple of ships with around 500 people arrived at the Guanabara Bay, present-day Rio de Janeiro, and settled on an island in baia de Guanabara. A fort, named Fort Coligny, was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian natives. It was the first permanent French settlement in the Americas. The French Wars of Religion were primarily fought in France, but the country's Catholic king Henry III also sought to suppress Protestantism in the French royal possessions of Normandy, Brittany, and Guyenne, as well as in Naples (a Kingdom of the House of Anjou) and in Flanders. When the French king Henry IV, who was originally a Huguenot, converted to Catholicism and promulgated the Edict of Nantes (1598), the Huguenots became assimilated into the dominant Catholic population. The French Huguenots, as well as Protestants from northern Europe, eventually developed two unique strains of Protestantism. These were differentiated by their geographic origins. The first was primarily Calvinist and followed the theological tenets set forth by John Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland. It became known as Calvinism. The second was located in central Europe. It followed the teaching of Martin Luther. This was called Lutheranism. In 1715, Louis XIV died and was succeeded by his five-year-old great-grandson, Louis XV. Philosophe Voltaire was a prominent Huguenot. The French Revolution , which started after the middle of the 18th century, saw a new birth of religious persecution. The French Revolution \"did not mark an end to persecution of Protestants in France. It in fact simply shifted persecutors. The state, and many elements within it, remained hostile to the Protestant minority.3] The Law of 20 May 1802 made Lutherans, Calvinists and other non-Catholics liable to severe penalties. Many Protestants emigrated or abjured their faith. The Concordat of 1801 ended religious persecution and the re-establishment of Catholicism as a state religion, but not before 6,000 Protestants had been forced to emigrate. The remainder were allowed to continue in their Protestant worship, under the supervision of local priests.[citation needed] The Concordat also stripped Protestants of their special privileges, such as special tax breaks, which placed them on an equal footing with Catholics. The laws separating the clergy from the laity were re-established. The clergy was once again required to be celibate. The Concordat restored much power to the Pope and the Papacy. The Huguenot community in England is one of the best-known of the French Protestant communities in exile, due to their association with the Glorious Revolution of 1688. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, it was successful in establishing itself with many members of the French aristocracy. The Huguenot cross is an Maltese cross with two interlocking crescents in the center. It is now used as the standard emblem of the Huguenot Society of Great Britain and Ireland. \"The French Wars of Religion, .\" Washington State University. \"France - The Wars of Religion.\" a b c d \"France.\" Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs.

(1998, J98) and Briffa (2000). The Briffa reconstruction was highlighted in AR4 with a red line. The TAR had shown the original version of the Briffa reconstruction, based on 15 long-lived trees from a remote Siberian site, as extending to 1980. The new version shown in AR4 was truncated, ending in 1960, thus omitting the post-1960 decline. The AR4 Chapter 6 text falsely stated that Briffa (2000) had shown the late 20th century decline as \"within the range of reconstructed variability over recent millennia.\" In fact, the decline was not \"within the range\"; it was at the very bottom of the reconstruction. The truncated Briffa reconstruction was shown on the spaghetti graph in the AR4 without its provenance being indicated. As the graphic was very similar to a graphic in the earlier Jones et al. (1999, J99) paper, it could be supposed that the same data had been used. The Briffa reconstruction was also shown in an earlier version of the AR4 without its provenance being indicated. This version of the AR4 featured a second spaghetti graph, which was not in the final version. The AR4 also featured a graphic of the divergence of the Briffa reconstruction from the modern instrumental record, captioned \"Briffa et al.

The apparent decline over recent decades in this tree-ring temperature history is likely to be an artifact of sampling.\" The text falsely described the divergence as being from the \"real temperature history\" when the divergence was from a reconstruction. The graphic falsely implied that the \"recent warming\" was clear in the Briffa reconstruction, when it was not even visible. The graphic contained a link to a paper by Briffa, Osborn and Schweingruber (2004, BOS04), which included a graph similar to that in the AR4. AR4 also referred to the divergence in the text of the IPCC Working Group I Fourth Assessment Report. The text stated: \"New data sets (updating the original work by Briffa et al., 1998, 2001) now exist that allow a longer tree-ring based reconstruction (Osborn and Briffa, 2006) that shows the existence of a 'Little Ice Age' and 'Medieval Warm Period' in the extra-tropical NH similar to those found in the Jones et al.

The Osborn and Briffa paper referred to the divergence, stating that \"there is increasing evidence of a breakdown in the ability of these proxies to track low-frequency variations in temperature at some sites. An important consequence of this \"divergence,\" particularly in high-latitude regions, is that a progressively worse match is obtained between observed temperature and reconstructions based on the tree-ring data\" and that \"we apply a simple \"correction\" for this effect, where the difference between observed and proxy-based temperatures are defined as the correction to be added to the proxy data to linearly \"correct\" the data so as to better align them with the observed temperature series.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been accused of misleading the public about the extent of the late 20th century decline in global temperatures."}

He also argued that the Gospel did not need the Pope's approval: \"For the true treasure of the church is the most holy gospel of the glory and grace of God.\" The Catholic Church taught that the Pope had the power to forgive people for their sins, and the Pope would grant that forgiveness, in the form of a document known as an indulgence, which would allow the forgiven person to go to heaven. In order to earn an indulgence, one had to perform good deeds, such as giving money to the church. One of the good deeds one could do was give money to the church in order to build St. Peter's Basilica, so that the Pope would have a new, grand church in which to hold masses. Luther argued that faith, not good works, was sufficient to gain salvation. He also argued that one should not need to give money to the church in order to go to heaven. His argument became very popular in Germany, and many people agreed with him. Many people in Germany had been concerned about corruption in the Catholic Church, including the selling of indulgences, so Luther's argument was very popular with them. Luther was called before the Diet of Worms (a meeting of the Holy Roman Empire's leaders) to defend his teachings. The meeting was held in Worms, Germany, in the year 1521. Luther defended himself before the meeting, but his arguments were rejected by the meeting's leaders. In spite of his failure to convince the Diet, Luther's argument was very popular in Germany, and it soon became widely believed that faith was more important than good works, and that indulgences should not be sold. The Pope responded by excommunicating Luther. Luther had been an Augustinian monk before he began to argue against the Catholic Church. Excommunication meant that Luther was now no longer a monk, and no longer part of the Catholic Church. However, Luther's teachings became popular in Germany, and many Germans supported him, including several of the princes of the German states.

However, Luther's teachings became popular in Germany, and many Germans supported him, including several of the princes of the German states. Luther's teachings became very popular throughout northern and central Germany. Many Germans supported him, because his teachings allowed them to question the Catholic Church. The teachings also became popular because they allowed German princes to gain more power, since they could now control the churches in their own states, and collect the taxes that had previously been given to the Catholic Church. Luther's teachings were not as popular in southern Germany, however. Many people in southern Germany continued to support the Catholic Church. Luther's teachings also became popular in several other countries. Many people in the Netherlands and in Scandinavia supported Luther's teachings, for example. Luther's teachings also became popular in England. In the year 1534, the English Parliament passed a law that made the king of England, Henry VIII, the head of the Church of England. This meant that the king controlled the English churches. Luther's teachings also led to the Protestant Reformation, which was a series of religious and political conflicts that were fought in several countries in Europe.

Luther's teachings became very popular throughout northern and central Germany. Many Germans supported him, because his teachings allowed them to question the Catholic Church. The teachings also became popular because they allowed German princes to gain more power, since they could now control the churches in their own states, and collect the taxes that had previously been given to the Catholic Church. Luther's teachings were not as popular in southern Germany, however. Many people in southern Germany continued to support the Catholic Church. Luther's teachings also became popular in several other countries. Many people in the Netherlands and in Scandinavia supported Luther's teachings, for example. Luther's teachings also became popular in England. In the year 1534, the English Parliament passed a law that made the king of England, Henry VIII, the head of the Church of England. This meant that the king controlled the English churches. Luther's teachings also led to the Protestant Reformation, which was a series of religious and political conflicts that were fought in several countries in Europe. Many people began to argue against the Catholic Church, and many new Christian religions were formed. Many of the new Christian religions had similar beliefs to those of Luther. For example, many of the new Christian religions agreed that good works were"}

At this point, Genghis Khan faced a dilemma: whether to continue his attack on the Xia or to turn west to fight the Western Xia. Genghis Khan decided to attack the Western Xia, but before he left, he appointed his third son, Tolui, as the commander in chief of the operations against the Xia. Tolui was given 50,000 troops, and he was ordered to continue the attack on the Xia capital city, Yinchuan. Tolui reached the outskirts of Yinchuan in 1228, but he was not strong enough to take the city. Tolui was ordered by his father to withdraw his army, leaving only a small garrison at Heisui to maintain a presence on the Yellow River.

{"original_text": "One of the main functions of the chloroplast is its role in photosynthesis, the process by which light is transformed into chemical energy, to subsequently produce food in the form of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. The chloroplast is a double membrane organelle. The inner membrane is folded into infoldings, called thylakoids, that contain photosynthetic pigments. The process of photosynthesis occurs in two stages called the light reactions and the dark reactions. The light reactions consist of the collection of light energy and its conversion into chemical energy. The dark reactions consist of the production of glucose from carbon dioxide and water. The light reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast. The dark reactions take place in the stroma. The first step in photosynthesis is the absorption of light by a chlorophyll pigment called chlorophyll a. Chlorophyll a is located in the thylakoid membrane and is the site of light absorption. The energy absorbed by the chlorophyll is used to split water into its two components, hydrogen ions and oxygen. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere. The hydrogen ions are stored in the thylakoid membrane. Next, an electron is transferred from the chlorophyll a pigment to a pigment called pheophytin. The energy gained by the pheophytin is transferred to an electron acceptor molecule called quinone. The quinone is reduced by the electron and becomes a new molecule, called plastoquinone. The oxygen that was released in the light reaction is used as an electron acceptor by the plastoquinone. This process is called the cyclic reaction and is part of the light reactions. The cyclic reaction occurs in the thylakoid membrane, where there are many pigments. The energy gained by the pigments is stored in the thylakoid membrane. The plastoquinone is now oxidized to its original form, and the cycle begins again. During the cyclic reaction, the thylakoid membrane becomes positively charged. In the stroma, there is another pigment called chlorophyll b. This pigment is located in the stroma, not in the thylakoid membrane, and absorbs a different wavelength of light than chlorophyll a. The energy absorbed by the chlorophyll b is used to reduce NADP to NADPH. The NADPH is used in the stroma in the dark reaction. The electrons that were stored in the thylakoid membrane are used in the stroma in the dark reaction. The electrons are transferred from the thylakoid membrane to the stroma. As a result, the NADPH and plastoquinone in the stroma are reduced. NADPH and plastoquinone are used to form glucose in the stroma in the dark reaction.

{"original_text": "The War of the Austrian Succession (whose North American theater is known as King George's War) formally ended in 1748 with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. The treaty gave the British many of the concessions they had been fighting for, while the French managed to retain a few key concessions in India. The 1750s saw war loom once more on the horizon. The main antagonists were the same, but by this time, the French and British colonies were both expanding into the Ohio River valley, and clashes between British colonists and French troops were increasingly frequent. In 1756, the Seven Years' War (known as the French and Indian War in North America) began. The French and Indian War was a conflict between the colonies of France and Britain, with their native American allies. Many of the battles took place in North America, although the conflict was essentially a European one, fought in several other theaters around the world. The war began with a series of French victories. The French captured several of Britain's Caribbean islands, and overwhelmed a large force under General Edward Braddock at the Battle of the Monongahela (July 9, 1755). However, the war would ultimately be decided in North America. The French lost control of the Ohio River valley at the Battle of the Monongahela in 1755, and British general James Wolfe captured Quebec in 1759. At the same time, British Admiral Edward Hawke won a decisive naval victory over a French fleet in the Battle of Quiberon Bay, giving the British complete control of the seas. In 1760, a force of British troops and colonists captured Montreal, effectively ending the war. France was forced to cede Canada and much of Louisiana to Britain. France's only consolation was that Spain agreed to exchange Florida for Cuba. This was a consolation because it meant that France was able to maintain its colony of Saint-Domingue (Haiti), which was a rich sugar producer and had become an important trading partner of France. The Seven Years' War was a watershed in the history of North America. France's defeat ended its ambitions to expand its empire in North America and left Britain as the dominant colonial power in North America. The British, however, were left with a huge debt from the war. This would eventually lead to taxation of the colonies, which would set the stage for the American Revolution. The Seven Years' War had a profound effect on the British colonies, which, for the first time, found themselves involved in a European-style war on their own soil. Many colonists took part in the war, and, for the first time, British officers were forced to rely on the militia to a large extent. This was a factor in a change in the way that British officers viewed the militia. Although the militia had performed well in several key battles (such as the Battle of Quebec), it was difficult to maintain discipline among the militia and they were not always available when needed. This led to a change in the way that the militia was regarded by the British army, and a shift in the way that it would be used in later conflicts.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "The French and Indian War was a conflict between the French colonies of France and Britain, with their native American allies, which took place in several other theaters around the world."}

The network also broadcasts the primetime portion of the March for Life rally held annually in Washington, D.C. in January, with no commentary, limited interruption for commercials, and the coverage usually introduced by one of the network's news anchors. The March for Life coverage includes pro-life speakers in the crowd, but none are interviewed or otherwise acknowledged on-camera.[7] The network also broadcasts the Citrus Bowl on New Year's Day, generally when CBS airs an NFL playoff game in the afternoon, and the Celebrity Golf Classic, a celebrity pro-am golf tournament held in November in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, the latter of which is produced by Silver Chalice, the digital media arm of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago White Sox ownership group, and is co-produced by the ATT Sports Networks. As of September 2015[update], ABC affiliates also carry the ESPN-produced Saturday morning sports-focused program ESPN College Football from the college football season through the network's Saturday afternoon game package. ESPN College Football (and more recently, Saturday afternoon college games) moved to ABC from ESPN2 in 2009, after ESPN gained partial broadcast rights to the Bowl Championship Series (a package now maintained by the successor of the BCS, the College Football Playoff). ABC broadcasts in 720p HDTV, the native resolution format for The Walt Disney Company's television properties. Most of the network's programming is produced in 1080i, while programs provided by Touchstone Television and other companies are broadcast in 480i standard definition (some shows, such as Desperate Housewives and Ugly Betty, are transmitted in 1080i, though the former was shot in 480i). ABC is one of the few U.S. broadcast networks that continued to use a 4:3 aspect ratio longer than the others. In 2006, Walt Disney Television chairman Anne Sweeney discussed the possibility of ABC broadcasting in high definition, with a Disney-produced show expected to be the first to be broadcast in the format.[8] In 2007, Disney-ABC Television Group announced that ABC would start broadcasting in 720p high definition, becoming the second U.S. broadcast network (after CBS) to announce plans to convert to the format.[9] The network began to broadcast in the format on April 15, 2008, with the broadcast of the ACM Awards telecast.[10] During the 2010s, the network began to use 16:9 framing for all of its programming outside of news and sports programming, regardless of whether a program was produced in 16:9 or in 4:3. ABC launched its live streaming and video-on-demand service, ABC Go, on April 30, 2013, with its initial slate of network programming, including all episodes of the first season of Scandal; users must authenticate with participating pay television providers in order to access the service's programming.[111213] The service became available to Comcast and Cablevision subscribers on October 1, 2013,[14] and to Time Warner Cable and Verizon FiOS subscribers on November 27.[15] The service was renamed as the ABC app in 2018. On December 14, 2016, ABC announced that it would begin to offer its owned-and-operated stations' live programming on Hulu's subscription service as part of a new deal reached between the network and streaming service.[16] ABC affiliate list List of ABC television affiliates (by U.S. state) List of ABC television affiliates (table) List of ABC television affiliates (by Nielsen DMA) \"Ted Turner's TV 'revolution'.\" BBC News.

{"original_text": "For most of human history higher material living standards - full stomachs, access to clean water and warmth from fuel - led to better health and longer lives. This pattern of economic growth and improving health was true in all regions of the world. But this is no longer the case. For the first time in human history, in many countries health improvements are not keeping up with economic growth. That is, there are some countries in which health is improving more slowly than the economy is growing. In other countries, health is improving at a rate that is slower than it used to be. As a result, life expectancy at birth has stopped rising in a number of countries. In the United States, for example, life expectancy actually fell from 2015 to 2016. Such recent trends in health are not attributable to factors such as war or famine. Rather, they appear to be the result of different types of economic growth. The economic growth we have achieved in the 21st century has come at a cost to health. Another recent development is that some countries have experienced declines in life expectancy. Again, this trend is not due to war or famine. Rather, it is a result of the drug overdose and suicide epidemics in the United States. Not all is doom and gloom. There are some countries and regions of the world - such as China and Latin America - in which health is improving at a faster pace than economic growth. This is due to a variety of factors, including economic growth that has lifted many out of extreme poverty. With the exception of the U.S., which has seen a recent reversal, health improvements have generally kept pace with economic growth in high-income countries.

The Working Party submitted its report in April 1982, making several recommendations. One of these was that a private university college be set up in North Eastern Province of Kenya. The Report of the Working Party was presented to Parliament on 31st October 1983 and subsequently became a Government White Paper. In the same year, the Commission for Higher Education endorsed the establishment of a private university college to be located in North Eastern Province of Kenya. The University College was to specialise in the following subjects: Food Science and Technology, Education, and It was to be established within three years of the White Paper on Higher Education. In the same year, the Commission for Higher Education, the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service and the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology made a public appeal in the press, inviting interested groups to apply for the establishment of a private university college. In 1985, the Commission for Higher Education, in its report to the Minister of Education, Science and Technology, recommended that Moi University be granted a Letter of Interim Authority and that its Charter be processed. The Minister accepted this recommendation. On 23rd March 1985, the Moi University Interim Governing Council was appointed by the Commission for Higher Education. The Council held its first meeting on 3rd May 1985 and elected Dr. Daniel Arap Moi as its Chairman. Later in May 1985, the Interim Council held a public meeting at the Nairobi Showground, where the University College was officially launched. On 17th May 1985, the Interim Council appointed a Selection Panel for the appointment of the first Vice-Chancellor of the University College. The Panel recommended the appointment of Professor Peter Koech. The Vice-Chancellor was to take over the office on 1st July 1985. On 27th November 1985, the Interim Council appointed the first Principals and Deans of the University College. In March 1986, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology appointed Dr. Daniel Arap Moi as Chancellor of the University College. On 10th May 1986, the first Senate of the University College was constituted. In May 1986, the University College was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee. On 28th July 1986, the College was formally gazetted. In October 1986, the Commission for Higher Education granted the University College a Letter of Interim Authority and a Provisional Certificate of Registration. On 14th December 1986, the College was opened by the Chancellor and the first students were admitted. The first graduation ceremony was held on 12th December 1989 when 479 students graduated.

Statistics are notoriously unreliable. For instance, the death rate in one city may be recorded as being 20, when it was actually 40 - because the living were too busy to count the dead. In the case of the Black Death, people were often buried immediately, or without ceremony, by groups of volunteers. Church graveyards were quickly full, so bodies were interred anywhere, including in the streets or in mass graves. Some were thrown into rivers, so accurate statistics are impossible to ascertain. The Black Death was the most significant epidemic in human history. The event is widely considered to have killed 50 million people, and reduced the world's population from an estimated 450 million to 350-375 million in the 14th century. The Black Death is estimated to have killed 30-60 of Europe's population. The Black Death is estimated to have killed 30-60 of Europe's population. The Black Death had a profound effect on medieval society. It hastened the decline of feudalism and brought an end to the dominance of the Roman Catholic Church. In addition, the Black Death initiated numerous social, political, religious, and economic upheavals. In the years after the Black Death, wages increased, while land rents fell, and Europeans enjoyed a higher standard of living. In the long run, the Black Death may have helped to pave the way for the Renaissance. The Black Death was caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which was spread by fleas carried by rats. These rats lived on the hundreds of merchant ships that arrived each year in the ports of the Middle East and Europe. Within two years, the plague had reached nearly every European country, as well as much of Asia and northern Africa. Plague was spread in three forms. The most common was bubonic plague, which accounted for 75 of all deaths. It began with the lymph nodes becoming inflamed, causing the formation of painful, red buboes. The buboes were commonly found in the armpits, groin and neck. Bubonic plague was often accompanied by fever, chills, extreme pain and headache. The bacteria could also spread to the lungs, causing a more virulent form of plague called pneumonic plague. This was the least common form of plague, but was the most dangerous. The third type of plague was septicemic plague, where the bacteria entered the bloodstream. The Black Death was not the first major epidemic in the Middle Ages. In the 6th century, 100,000 people died of plague in Constantinople. The first pandemic, which became known as the Plague of Justinian, began in Egypt in 541, and spread to the Middle East and Europe, where it killed up to 100 million people. In 1347, the disease returned to Europe, and was much more virulent. It struck in 1347 and recurred in Europe for four years. The plague then returned in 1361, 1369, and 1374. In 1389, a new outbreak occurred, killing 20,000 people in London alone. Plague continued to strike throughout the 14th and 15th centuries, and in 1563, 20,000 people died of it in London. The third major epidemic was the Great Plague, which began in 1665 in London. It is believed to have been bubonic plague, but the symptoms were so severe that it is possible it was pneumonic.

{"original_text": "In cases where the criminalized behavior is pure speech, civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech. An example would be WBAI's broadcasting the track \"Filthy Words\" from a George Carlin comedy album, after a 1973 Supreme Court decision temporarily prohibited its broadcast. The execution of laws which have outlived their usefulness, and the disestablishment of policies that inhibit freedom. For example, the burning of draft cards in the 1960s was intended to protest the Vietnam War. Breaking a law which is believed never to have been valid. For example, prior to the repeal of prohibition, there were groups such as The Woman's Organization for National Prohibition Reform. During the Vietnam War, some people intentionally destroyed their draft cards as an act of civil disobedience, in spite of the fact that this was illegal. A more passive and symbolic civil disobedience takes the form of nonviolent protesters obstructing a street or highway. Such nonviolent physical obstruction is usually done in small numbers. If done as a mass protest, or if it employs more aggressive tactics, it is usually called a blockade, which is a more confrontational and less civil form of civil disobedience. In a variation on nonviolent obstruction, a group may decamp from its normal location and occupy a site that is more symbolic or otherwise useful to the cause. These tactics of occupation are usually followed by arrests, but in some cases, such as the Occupy Wall Street movement, the occupiers continue to occupy for several weeks or months. Because civil disobedience is intended to be nonviolent, it is normally accepted that the protesters will avoid any physical altercation with the authorities. One of the best-known examples of this is Martin Luther King's 1963 Letter from Birmingham Jail. He explains that the \"Birmingham police have shown consistently that they will not protect the lives and property of Negroes.\" Therefore, he argues, it is only by disobeying an unjust law that the higher moral principle can be made clear to the police and the government. Similarly, Gandhi argued that \"civil disobedience can be civil only if the protesters mindfully put their own lives and bodies at risk by resisting the police.\" In this view, it is the willingness of the protesters to accept punishment (by doing so, following the precepts of non-violence) for their actions that differentiates it from simple law-breaking. The theory behind civil disobedience is that a government's foundation is dependent upon the consent of the governed. Civil disobedience is thus a mechanism to express, reinforce, or indicate the withdrawal of the consent on which the government's authority is completely dependent. In other words, if enough of the governed withdraw their consent from a law, government can no longer claim that law is valid, and the law becomes a \"dead letter.\" The government cannot be the final arbiter of its own legitimacy, since it might have a vested interest in immunizing its own authority from criticism. If the government is not the source of the law, then it cannot be the source of its own authority, because there would be no way for the government to say that its authority applies to itself. To summarize: the government cannot be the source of its own authority, because if the government determines its own authority, then it would be the source of its own authority. But the government is not the source of its own authority, so the government cannot be the source of its own authority. This contradiction is resolved by positing a higher source of authority, which does not depend on the government's say-so, and which therefore provides a basis for challenging the government's claims. In the United States, the higher source of authority is usually regarded to be the Constitution, which is regarded as a social contract binding the government, not the governed. In other societies, the source of authority may be religious. Gandhi's concept of civil disobedience is similar to, but differs in important respects from, Socrates' civil disobedience. Socrates' civil disobedience was that of not accepting the majority opinion that sentenced him to death. Gandhi's civil disobedience was that of not accepting the British tax laws. Gandhi's disobedience of the British law is an important part of his philosophy of nonviolent resistance.

{"original_text": "Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, who succeeded Marin as commander of the French forces after the latter died on October 29, invited Washington to dine with him. Over dinner, Washington presented the French commander with a proposal that would free hundreds of American troops to fight on land, if not the sea. The troops in question were some 3,000 Continentals under Brigadier General David Wooster, who had been sent to defend Newport in August, but had never made it to the island. Wooster's men were now in the process of marching up from New York to join Washington in White Plains. What if, Washington asked Legardeur, they were instead diverted to Newport? There, they could serve as the French navy's army, marching overland from the mainland and joining French forces already on the island. The French commander was delighted. Such a plan would free up the French fleet to sail elsewhere, and the presence of a few hundred Americans on the island would significantly strengthen the French position. That night, Legardeur and his officers presented the proposal to the French commander, the Comte d'Estaing, who approved. The next morning, d'Estaing and Legardeur sent Washington a letter, confirming their agreement. \"We think it so interesting to the welfare of the united cause that we do not doubt your consenting to it.\" On the surface, Washington's acceptance of the proposal seems baffling. After all, he had only just arrived in White Plains, where he was struggling to organize an army to oppose the British. And yet, the proposal came with a tempting side benefit: if the French occupied Newport, it would remove the British fleet's ability to threaten New York from the sea, and might even provide an opportunity to strike against the enemy's New York base. Furthermore, the proposal seemed to fit with Washington's overall strategic objective. For years, the goal had been to expel the British from North America, and now, with the French fleet in New York waters, the moment seemed ripe to accomplish that objective. But it was a risk. If the French were unable to hold the island, the British would still be able to strike at New York, and Washington would be left with a weakened army in New York and an isolated French force on the island. On November 5, Washington gave his consent to the French proposal, with the caveat that they were to occupy the island only as long as the war continued, and that the British should be permitted to evacuate. With that, d'Estaing and his forces sailed for Newport. The next morning, Washington, as promised, set off with the rest of his army for White Plains. On November 11, Washington reached White Plains and, with the arrival of the Continental Army, the town of White Plains began to buzz with activity. The British force under General Howe, which had occupied the town only a few days earlier, was now nowhere to be seen. On the morning of November 3, they had set off, chasing after the Americans, who had once again moved their army up the Bronx River to a position on the high ground overlooking White Plains. The British pursued them, and at midday, the armies clashed again. But the Americans were too far away from the British lines, and the battle was over quickly, with the Continental Army once again withdrawing before the British force. The British, though, were in no shape to pursue the Americans. They had lost two hundred men, and Washington had lost less than fifty. The British had also suffered a serious blow when General Howe, who had been leading the pursuit, was felled by a musket ball to the head. Howe was carried back to New York, where he lay in a fever for several days before recovering. The British army now under the command of General William Howe, his brother.

{"original_text": "In 1854 at Ballarat there was an armed rebellion against the government of Victoria by miners protesting against mining taxes (the \"Eureka Stockade. This was crushed by British troops, but some of the leaders of the protest subsequently were elected to the Victorian parliament. Between 1855 and 1890, the six colonies individually gained responsible government, managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the British Empire. The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs, defence, and international shipping. On 1 January 1901, the colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. The new constitutional monarchy of Australia came into being under the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (Imp). This had been passed by the British parliament in 1900. The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) was formed in 1911 as the location for the future federal capital of Canberra. It was formally brought under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth by the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910. The Northern Territory was transferred from the control of the South Australian government to the Commonwealth's in 1911. In 1927, the United Kingdom Parliament passed the Statute of Westminster, conferring a large degree of power on the Dominions, including the Australian Commonwealth. Under the statute, the United Kingdom could no longer make new laws for the Australian Commonwealth without its consent. However, the Australian Commonwealth did not ratify the statute until 1942. Australian history is characterised by a strong emphasis on political and economic liberalism. The most important event in the 20th century history of Australia is the increase of economic ties between the Australian economy and the economies of the east Asia region, which started in the 1960s and 1970s. This led to economic reform through the 1980s and 1990s. There was less emphasis on government regulation and protection of Australian businesses. In the late 1960s, Australian Prime Minister John Gorton, Labour Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and Democrat Senator Don Chipp, were involved in an intense debate about multiculturalism in Australia. Australia has always had a very multicultural society, but in the 1960s the population of Australia had its largest percentage of people from British background. In the 1960s Australia's population was very different to that of the 21st century. There was a policy of assisted passage, which meant that the Australian government paid part of the air fare for people to migrate to Australia from Europe. The immigration policy of the 1960s encouraged European people from Britain, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Yugoslavia to migrate to Australia. In the 1970s there was a second wave of immigration from Asian countries like Vietnam. Multiculturalism was a policy of the Whitlam Labour government. Whitlam abolished assisted passage and did not encourage new migrants to Australia. This meant that the Australian economy had a shortage of labour in the 1970s. In 1972, the Australian population was 13 million. In 2009, the population was 22 million, with over 45 of the population born outside Australia or having a parent born outside Australia. During the 1980s and 1990s, the Australian economy was hit by a severe economic recession, which led to a change of government. The government of the day made large cuts to education and public services. During this time, the Prime Minister, Paul Keating, said in a speech in 1992 that Australia should not be a monocultural society. In the 1990s, Australia continued to have a large immigration program. The immigrants came from many different countries. In 1996, Pauline Hanson was elected to the Australian House of Representatives for the party One Nation. She made a speech in parliament, in which she said Australia was being swamped by Asians. This speech helped her to become well known. In 1998, John Howard of the Liberal party was elected Prime Minister. Howard's government cut immigration to Australia. This was because Australia was having a recession in the 1990s.

Therefore, they are also known as T-helper-like cells and NK-like cells. T cells are found mainly in the epithelium of the skin and mucosa of the intestine, liver, and lungs, but also in the blood. They have been shown to play a crucial role in protecting mucosal surfaces from infection and are an important component of the innate immune system. T cells are found mainly in the epithelium of the skin and mucosa of the intestine, liver, and lungs, but also in the blood. They have been shown to play a crucial role in protecting mucosal surfaces from infection and are an important component of the innate immune system. They are also thought to be able to provide help for other immune cells including B cells and NK cells, and to play an important role in inflammation. T cells develop in the thymus, however, in contrast to T cells, they do not require thymic selection. The most common method for identifying T cells is by antibody staining of the TCR, and the two most common antibodies for this are CD3 and CD3e. CD3e is the epsilon chain of the TCR, a molecule unique to T cells, and is expressed on the cell surface of all T cells, whereas the CD3 complex is expressed on all T cells. CD3e is the epsilon chain of the TCR, a molecule unique to T cells, and is expressed on the cell surface of all T cells, whereas the CD3 complex is expressed on all T cells. CD3e is an ideal surface marker for identifying T cells, as it is a single chain and not prone to dissociation. The TCR repertoire of T cells is very diverse, with many TCR combinations and isotypes. The V1 and V2 chains are the most predominant in mice and humans. The V2 chain is the most common in mice, whereas V1 is the most common in humans.

The expression of the TCR is complex and varies depending on the isotype and the tissue, with the most common being the CD3eV1V1 combination. T cells are a heterogenous population of cells. They can be divided into three main subsets, according to the expression of CD25, CD4, and CD8.

During the light dependent reactions, the absorption of light by chlorophyll in the antenna complexes of photosystem II and photosystem I is used to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane. The pumped protons are used to make ATP in the cytoplasm by chemiosmosis. The energy-storage molecule NADPH is made by the light-dependent reactions when electrons derived from water are transported through photosystem I and photosystem II.

{"original_text": "Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested areas. The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and development of the land. Prior to the early 1970s, the Amazon was almost completely untouched by humans. The increasing demand for food and resources caused the deforestation of the Amazon. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Brazilian government encouraged colonization of the Amazon by creating infrastructure, such as the Trans-Amazonian Highway. The human activity in the Amazon has continued to increase over the past 20 years. Currently, over 20 of the Amazon has been deforested, with the majority of deforestation occurring in Brazil. The main deforestation in Brazil is due to land clearing for cattle ranching and agriculture. Brazil is the world's leading exporter of beef and soybeans, which have been a main driving force for the deforestation of the Amazon. In the Amazon, deforestation is also causing a decrease in biodiversity. There is a high rate of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon due to illegal gold mining, leading to habitat loss and endangerment of many species. The loss of biodiversity is a major concern for the Amazon, as biodiversity provides many services such as carbon storage, water filtration, and prevention of soil erosion.

Rates of sea-level rise had dropped so far, that natural sedimentation by the Rhine River had almost kept up with the sea-level rise. In the Roman period, the Rhine delta was the largest in Europe, and an important strategic military-political factor. It has long been known that the Roman port of Batavia was situated on the southern side of the mouth of the Oude Rijn. The port has been investigated by many archaeologists, and the remains of the port have been surveyed, but the actual location of the port was not known. For archaeologists the Roman port of Batavia has been an enigma. The port, and the river have long been submerged, and it has not been possible to locate the port. The location of the port of Batavia, has been determined by geological and geophysical surveys, which have shown the location of the river mouth, and the port itself. Using geological and geophysical surveys it was possible to determine the position of the mouth of the Oude Rijn, and the positions of the Roman port of Batavia. In the years 2002, 2004 and 2007 geological and geophysical surveys were carried out. The results of these surveys were the basis for the archaeological research. The geophysical and geological survey was carried out from the shore at the north side of the Oude Rijn, to the sea. The geological research, and geophysical survey were carried out in two phases. In the first phase, geological survey, and geophysical survey were carried out to determine the geological situation of the present day coast, and the presence of archaeological remains in the shore. The geophysical survey was carried out with a geophysical proton magnetometer, with a loop size of 32 x 25 cm. The survey was carried out at 10 m intervals. The geophysical results were interpreted by Dr. J.H.M. Jansen of Geoscan bv. The geophysical survey showed no archaeological remains in the shore. The geological survey was carried out with a Sonic penetrator. The penetrator was used to determine the depth of the palaeosol. The palaeosol is the original soil at the time the area was not submerged by the sea. The results of the geological survey were used to determine the position of the river mouth. The results of the geological survey showed that the palaeosol had disappeared over most of the shore. This indicates that the shore has been submerged by the sea. The only place where the palaeosol was still present was at the eastern end of the survey. The palaeosol was present at 2.5 m below present sea-level. This indicates that the river mouth was at the present position of the eastern tip of the land spit. In the second phase, the geological and geophysical surveys were carried out in the area of the river mouth. The geophysical survey was carried out with a proton magnetometer, with a loop size of 32 x 25 cm. The survey was carried out at 10 m intervals.

{"original_text": "Recently, chloroplasts have caught attention by developers of genetically modified crops. Since, in most flowering plants, chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent, transgenes in these plastids cannot be transmitted to future generations of plants, making chloroplasts an interesting option for the development of sterile, transgenic crops. For example, scientists from Monsanto and Syngenta have already developed plants with plastid-encoded resistance against some pathogens. However, so far, the genes responsible for the resistance have been inserted into the chloroplast genome by means of natural recombination. A recent article in Current Biology, by Katz et al., describes how scientists have successfully introduced transgenes into chloroplasts by means of genetic engineering. They succeeded in expressing a gene for a fluorescent protein in tobacco chloroplasts, making the plants glow green. The researchers found that this expression was stable, in contrast to the previously described genes for antimicrobial proteins, which were inherited only by a few percent of the offspring plants. I was interested in finding out more about this research, so I contacted the lead author of the article, Steve Katz, and asked him a few questions about the work.

{"original_text": "While most Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs and require a valid prescription, some Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription. Many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the inconvenience of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk-to-benefit ratios, and suitability of a medication to a given patient. Some, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, have argued that the inability to get a prescription drug from an Internet pharmacy can cause delay in treatment for those without access to other sources. The Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies also argues that the lack of physical examination may lead to improper prescriptions for medications that have side effects such as addiction. Some online pharmacies also offer services to customers over the internet. The scope of the services varies widely and includes prescription drug renewals, shipping of routine refills, specialty medicine and patient care management. Some online pharmacies also provide services like online doctor consultation. Some online pharmacies (e.g. 121doc.co.uk) are now offering services (like free delivery) to their customers and do not require a prescription for their products. The Medicines Act 1968 allows the sale of unlicensed medicines with the approval of a medical practitioner. This can be in the form of a prescription or a direction given by a doctor in a prescription-only medicine's patient leaflet. The sale of unlicensed medicines online is still illegal in the UK; however, there is no regulation for marketing and advertising of unlicensed medicines to the public. The industry standard for website certification is the Norton Secured Seal, which is only awarded to pharmacies that comply with the strictest safety standards and is the only safety seal backed by Norton's 50 million global customers. The term \"online pharmacy\" is a contentious issue as there are several companies that operate as online pharmacies in the U.S., however, many are not certified to sell pharmaceuticals. They are referred to as online pharmacies, but many are really online stores that sell a wide variety of products in addition to pharmaceuticals. The term \"online pharmacy\" is used to refer to both legitimate online pharmacies and illicit online pharmacies. In the UK, the sale of prescription medicines is allowed only with a prescription from a medical practitioner. The Medicines Act 1968 (UK) requires that prescription drugs be sold by a pharmacy only, and that prescription drugs be dispensed by a pharmacist. In the U.S., the federal government has enacted laws to address this issue. The Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, which came into law in March 2008, amends the Controlled Substances Act to address online pharmacies. It classifies offences as either prescription drug fraud or prescription drug trafficking. The Controlled Substances Act is the statute that outlaws drugs in the U.S. Some states have also enacted laws against pharmacies operating without a valid physical address within the state. The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) operates the .Pharmacy Verified Websites Program, which accredits online pharmacies that meet stringent safety and other criteria. There are also some websites which provide ratings and reviews of online pharmacies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved RxCut for the sale of prescription drugs by U.S.-based pharmacies. Although the majority of U.S. pharmacies are independently owned, many are operated through mail-order systems. For example, the United States Postal Service operates the largest civilian fleet of vehicles in the world, and is legally allowed to deliver prescription drugs to residents in many states. Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's are some examples of stores which operate as membership clubs that require a paid membership to purchase prescriptions.

{"original_text": "Tesla served as a vice president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the forerunner (along with the Institute of Radio Engineers) of the modern-day IEEE, from 1892 to 1894. He was also involved in establishing the new American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) as president of the first AIEE board of directors. Tesla is quoted by the New York Times in 1909 as saying, \"My apparatus offers no chance whatever to the experimenter to discover some new principle.\" Others were even more adamant about the impossibility of extracting free energy from the vacuum. As I mentioned, there is a lot of controversy about free energy, so I have to be careful not to get too caught up in that. I must simply present the facts and let you draw your own conclusions. The most popular theoretical model for the electrical effects in the vacuum is known as quantum electrodynamics (QED). QED has been extremely successful in describing the behavior of atoms, molecules, and subatomic particles; however, it is only considered valid at the microscopic level. At the macroscopic level - that is, the level at which we can see things - QED fails miserably when trying to describe the behavior of electricity and magnetism. In 1971, David Bohm, a physicist from London's Birkbeck College, and Basil Hiley, then at Birkbeck and now professor of physics at the University of London, developed the theory of the implicate order. This new approach to physics was based on the phenomenon that subatomic particles are able to remain in contact with one another regardless of the distance separating them. Bohm and Hiley asserted that subatomic particles are able to remain in contact with one another because the separating space is not empty, as has been postulated by scientists since Newton. According to Bohm and Hiley, the universe is filled with a background energy - what Einstein called the ether - which contains an infinite quantity of energy. It is theorized that the vacuum energy is the subtle energy that is tapped by the quantum vacuum devices in order to produce free energy. The idea of the ether goes back to the ancient Greeks, who considered it to be the substance in which the heavenly bodies were suspended. Newton believed in the ether and thought it to be the medium for gravity. In 1905, Einstein showed that Newton's ideas of space and time were incorrect, and that space was curved by matter. Matter tells space how to curve, and space tells matter how to move. Space, then, was no longer regarded as being filled with an ether, but was rather a vacuum. This vacuum was deemed to be completely empty, but later physicists began to suspect that it was not completely empty after all. In the mid 1920s, the American astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe is expanding. He came to this conclusion after measuring the velocities of distant galaxies and finding that they were all moving away from us. This meant that the universe must have been smaller in the past than it is today. This evidence led Hubble to propose the Big Bang theory, which he presented at the 1929 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in the auditorium of the University of California at Berkeley. According to the Big Bang theory, the universe began in a state of extremely high density and temperature. At some point a cataclysmic event took place, and the universe began expanding. After the Big Bang, the universe remained in a very high temperature state for about 100,000 years. During this time the universe was filled with light in the form of gamma rays and was extremely opaque, like a misty fog. The high temperature and pressure prevented the formation of atoms, and electrons and nuclei of atoms were able to exist freely in a sea of radiation. At some point, however, the high temperature and pressure in the early universe caused it to expand and cool, and the electrons and nuclei were able to combine to form the first atoms. The universe had finally cooled enough to form atoms. The light of the Big Bang traveled freely through the universe for the next 380,000 years, and the universe was finally able to become transparent.

{"original_text": "Walt Disney and his brother Roy contacted Goldenson at the end of 1953 for ABC to agree to finance part of the Disneyland project in exchange for producing a television program for ABC. Although ABC was a fledgling network, it attracted Disney because it was not tied to a film studio that might interfere with his free rein in developing the content of the proposed television program. With ABC on board, Disney was then able to obtain a 500,000 loan from Bank of America to supplement his own 10,000 savings and the 400,000 he raised from other private investors. The Disneyland concept was a larger-than-life amusement park with attractions based on Disney animated films and television shows. To develop and build the park, Walt Disney appointed Walter E. Dymkus to be Disneyland's manager, and Harrison \"Buzz\" Price to determine a suitable location for the park. Walt Disney, with the aid of his brother Roy and his friend Herb Ryman, created a map of the park. Roy Disney then met with Stanford Research Institute to determine whether the proposed site in Anaheim, California was suitable for development. Based on SRI's positive evaluation, 160 acres (65 ha) of orange groves and walnut trees in Anaheim were purchased in 1954 for 800,000, and Disneyland construction began a year later. In July 1954, Walt Disney announced that Disneyland would be built in a 100-acre (40 ha) parcel of property bordered by South Harbor Boulevard, West Ball Road, Interstate 5, and South Disneyland Drive in Anaheim. Disney purchased the site for approximately 800,000, and sold 560,000 worth of stock in the Disneyland corporation to ABC (which was to co-produce the Disneyland television show) and other Hollywood investors. The site was situated in a suburban area 22 miles (35 km) southeast of Hollywood, in an area largely occupied by agricultural land and residential housing. A major issue was the availability of water, as the area was suffering from a drought. However, Disney was convinced that an underground aquifer would support the development. He also wanted to provide free parking to attract visitors, so Disney purchased a 100-acre (40 ha) parcel along the western edge of the site from farmer William B. Evans, Jr. for 100,000. This gave the park more than enough land for a large parking lot. In order to provide the necessary water supply, Disney acquired the rights to the first 1,200 acres (490 ha) of the Santa Ana River from the Orange County Water District for 50,000. Much of the Disneyland property was floodplain. To overcome this problem, the construction crews pumped tons of sandy fill into the site, while crews built retaining walls to contain the river, which now flows through a concrete channel. The first stage of construction was to clear the site of buildings, underbrush, and trees. When Disneyland opened in July 1955, the park had 20 attractions, no hotels, and only six dining establishments. Within the first three years, the park expanded to 40 attractions and eight restaurants. By 1959, the park hosted 7.7 million visitors, and Walt Disney Productions invested 20 million into the property. The park's expansion during the first three years was not without problems. The park initially opened with only five hours of electricity, which was scheduled to operate the attractions between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. In the summer of 1955, the park had no nighttime activities, because the rides and attractions were not equipped for night use. That year, the park had a total of 12,000 light bulbs, most of which were in the park's lighting fixtures. Walt Disney personally hired experts to help the park with its lighting, including Roland F. \"Doc\" Sheridan and J. G. \"Marty\" Sklar. They worked with outside lighting companies to create better lighting for the park. In 1957, Walt Disney hired a lighting director, Joe Fowler, who brought in new lights to Disneyland.

At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O2. Oxygen is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table, is a highly reactive nonmetal, and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O2. Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8 of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust. Dioxygen is the most common oxidizing agent in nature. Conversely, oxygen is also reduced, forming oxides and peroxides; notable examples include the superoxides, the peroxides, and ozone. Oxygen reacts spontaneously with some transition metals, such as iron, to give oxides and peroxides. Oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen and helium and the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust. Oxygen is highly reactive, and in its pure form is a colorless, odorless gas. In the atmosphere, it is usually found in the form of a diatomic gas. Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8 of the volume of air. In nature, elemental oxygen is produced from water by cyanobacteria, algae and plants during photosynthesis and is used in cellular respiration for all other living organisms. Oxygen is toxic to obligately anaerobic organisms, which were the dominant form of life on Earth until the Great Oxygenation Event. Oxygen is a very reactive element and must exist in the 2 state. It readily forms compounds with almost all other elements. Oxygen is the most electronegative element. It is one of the two elements with a diatomic state of matter at standard conditions for temperature and pressure, the other being bromine. Oxygen reacts spontaneously with some transition metals, such as iron, to give oxides and peroxides; the lightest transition metal nitride is uranium nitride. The extraction of a key intermediate product in the industrial synthesis of ethylene glycol from ethylene oxide represents a major commercial application of the direct oxidation of hydrocarbons by oxygen. Reactive oxygen species are intermediates or products of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have a short lifetime in the cell. However, during times of environmental stress, production of these compounds may exceed the cell's capacity to neutralize them, leading to oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species can induce programmed cell death and stimulate cell proliferation. Oxygen, as a part of oxygen gas (O2), is produced from water by cyanobacteria, algae and plants during photosynthesis and is used in cellular respiration for all other living organisms. Green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70 of the free oxygen produced on earth and the rest of free oxygen is produced by terrestrial plants. Oxygen is produced industrially by fractional distillation of liquefied air, use of zeolites and electrolysis of water into which dissolved potassium hydroxide has been introduced to increase the conductivity. Oxygen was first discovered by Swedish pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. He called it \"fire air\" because it was the only known supporter of combustion, and was later proved to support life. The name oxygen was coined by Antoine Lavoisier. Oxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the Earth's biosphere, air, sea and land.

If the state does not provide these services, then other providers will charge for them and they will not disappear. Secondly, there is a choice of different kinds of tax. For example, if a poll tax is introduced, then this will not reduce income tax. If a flat rate tax is introduced, then this will not reduce corporation tax. Thirdly, taxes are complicated. The more complicated the tax system, the more difficult it will be to calculate how much it costs to collect. The TaxPayers' Alliance claims that a flat rate of income tax would cost 20 billion a year to introduce. However, the government's own research concludes that the cost of introducing a flat rate of income tax would be 30 billion a year. The TaxPayers' Alliance also argues that the cost of collecting the taxes on tobacco and alcohol is 500 million a year. However, the UK Government's own research estimates that the cost of collecting tobacco taxes is 300 million a year and the cost of collecting alcohol taxes is 600 million a year. Moreover, the TaxPayers' Alliance does not take into account all of the costs of collecting taxes. For example, it does not include the cost of prosecuting people who avoid paying tax or the cost of investigating and challenging tax avoidance schemes. For more details, see Chapter 6 of the Mirrlees Review of the UK Tax System. In the UK, the poorest 10 of households pay a higher proportion of their income in taxes than the richest 10 of households. In other words, the tax system in the UK is regressive. Of course, some taxes are more progressive than others. Income tax is progressive. Council tax is regressive. The TaxPayers' Alliance claims that in 200809, the poorest 10 of households paid a lower proportion of their income in taxes than the richest 10 of households. However, it does not include the cost of means-tested benefits in its calculation. It also does not include the costs of indirect taxes on goods and services that the poorest 10 of households are more likely to buy. When indirect taxes are included, then the richest 10 of households pay a higher proportion of their income in taxes than the poorest 10 of households. Moreover, the tax burden on poorer households will increase under the Government's spending cuts, as means-tested benefits are cut. The TaxPayers' Alliance claims that the UK government spends 18 million a year on health and safety regulation. However, it does not explain what it means by health and safety regulation or where the 18 million figure comes from. Moreover, the cost of health and safety regulation is not easy to estimate. It depends on how one defines health and safety regulation. The TaxPayers' Alliance also claims that the UK government spends 36 million a year on equality and diversity regulation. However, it does not explain what it means by equality and diversity regulation or where the 36 million figure comes from. Moreover, the cost of equality and diversity regulation is not easy to estimate. It depends on how one defines equality and diversity regulation. The TaxPayers' Alliance claims that the UK government spends 126 million a year on regulating the telecommunications sector. However, it does not explain what it means by regulating the telecommunications sector or where the 126 million figure comes from. Moreover, the cost of regulating the telecommunications sector is not easy to estimate. It depends on how one defines regulating the telecommunications sector. Moreover, the cost of regulating the telecommunications sector will depend on whether it is regulated by the government or by Ofcom. For example, Ofcom's operating costs in 200910 were 146 million.

Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDsthe virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLCLAPDLAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks.

There are also a number of colleges, museums, and galleries, including the National Museum, the Cathedral of St. Mary, and the Archaeological Museum, all of which have collections dating back to the Middle Ages. The site of Krakow was occupied by a Slavonic settlement in the 7th century, but a town was not established until about 1000. In the 11th century the area was ruled by the Piast dynasty, who established a bishopric in 1000. In 1241 the city was captured by the Mongols. Krakow was the capital of Poland from 1038 to 1569, when Warsaw was chosen as the new capital. The city was part of the Habsburg Empire from 1583 until 1684, when it was seized by the Swedes, but it was restored to Poland in 1697. After the final partition of Poland in 1795, Krakow was ceded to Austria and became the capital of Galicia. During World War II, Krakow was under German occupation and was known as the seat of the German Governor General Hans Frank (1939-45).

Exploration is still ongoing to determine the extent of oil deposits in Turkana and the coastal region. According to Tullow Oil, Kenya's proven oil reserves are estimated to be around 10 billion barrels. Kenya's potential gas reserves are estimated at 500 billion cubic feet. The Government is also evaluating shale gas and coal bed methane potential. According to Ministry of Energy and Petroleum, Kenya's oil reserves stand at 1.2 billion barrels, of which 600 million barrels are recoverable. Tullow Oil is the leading oil exploration company in the country. In the past, Kenya had a thriving oil industry that produced 12,000 barrels per day, but this industry collapsed in the 1970s and 1980s due to mismanagement and the falling oil prices. In 2012, Kenya earned KES 2.8 billion from oil exploration. The Ministry of Energy and Petroleum is implementing the Kenya Petroleum Exploration and Production Bill 2014, which will guide the development of the upstream oil and gas sector. The National Oil Corporation of Kenya (NOCK) is the state-owned oil company in Kenya. NOCK's functions include importing, storing and distributing petroleum products in Kenya. The company also acts as an advisor to the Government on matters related to energy and petroleum. Other private players in the industry include Kenol Kobil, Total Kenya, Oil Libya and Shell Kenya. The oil and gas sector in Kenya is still in the exploration and development stage. There are no local suppliers of oilfield equipment. The country imports 100 per cent of its crude oil. Oil exploration firms are required to use local services and goods in their operations. This is in compliance with the Local Content Policy and the National Oil and Gas Policy. The Kenya Petroleum Refineries (KPRL) is the only refinery in Kenya. The refinery has a capacity of 35,000 barrels per day and produces petroleum products including gasoline, diesel, kerosene, aviation fuel and lubricants. The Ministry of Energy and Petroleum has set up a Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) working group to explore the feasibility of LPG development in the country. The group will study the establishment of LPG import facilities and distribution infrastructure in Kenya. In 2014, the Government of Kenya signed a preliminary deal to construct a KES 47 billion oil refinery in Lamu. The facility will have a capacity of 120,000 barrels per day.

In my own work, I find that regional zoning regulations are an important part of understanding housing prices, especially at the higher end of the market. As I was reading about the work of Rodda, Vigdor, and Matlack, I was reminded of the work of US Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon. A number of years ago I heard an economist discussing Mellon's work on the economics of zoning and the impact of zoning on the supply of housing. I can't find the original source, but I did find an article on the Mellon's ideas from 2007, written by Mark Thornton. Here is the relevant excerpt from Thornton's article: Andrew Mellon, the U.S. Treasury Secretary in the 1920s, wrote, \"Within the past year I have come to the conclusion that zoning restrictions and building codes have been greatly responsible for the present high cost of housing....I have come to the conclusion that if it were possible to repeal all building laws and codes...we would have the low cost home and the end of the slums.\" Mellon's insights, though overlooked, are worth pursuing, because they expose a serious problem with government zoning policy. The problem is that zoning laws, which were intended to promote better living conditions for city dwellers, have led to the opposite. The problem is that these zoning laws were not just a way to \"promote better living conditions,\" but were instead a way to exclude lower-class people from certain neighborhoods.

Today, we have a far better understanding of the plague bacillus, which is so called because it has the shape of a rod or bacillus. The bubonic plague is a disease caused by bacteria called Yersinia pestis. It is transmitted by fleas that live on rats. The flea's bite transmits the bacteria to the bloodstream, and can be fatal within two or three days. It is not spread from person to person. A person with the bubonic plague will experience fever, vomiting, headaches and painfully swollen glands. Without treatment, death can come within three days. In the Middle Ages, the bubonic plague was fatal in 70-90 of cases. \"In the first year there was a terrible mortality in England among the upper classes, and in the second year it was even worse. Many thousands of people died and many cities were almost destroyed\" The Black Death was the most devastating epidemic in recorded history, killing between 30 and 60 of Europe's population. Today, we estimate that between 75 and 200 million people died. The Black Death arrived in Europe in October 1347, when twelve Genoese galleys docked in Sicily. They carried rats, and more worryingly, the bacteria that caused the bubonic plague. Genoese merchants were well known for their trading links with the Black Sea, and the Italian city of Genoa was an important trading port. The Black Death spread through Europe by sea and overland. It was impossible to contain and people had no idea what was causing it. \"The pestilence was so powerful that it could not be checked by any means\" As people fled the Black Death, many carried the bacteria with them. The plague became a stowaway on trading ships and in the baggage of fleeing travellers. The Black Death was a pandemic - a disease that has spread over a wide geographical area. The plague pandemic arrived in England via Bristol in June 1348 and swept rapidly across the country. The Black Death was so destructive because no-one knew what was causing it. This meant that there was no way to prevent it, and no cure. The symptoms of the plague were well known, but the cause was not. This meant that there was no way to prevent it spreading. The lack of any cure meant that the plague spread quickly. Within four years, it had killed between one third and half of Europe's population. The symptoms of the bubonic plague were well known, but the cause was not. People believed that the plague was sent as a punishment from God for the sins of mankind. They took to prayer, penance and processions. They made offerings to churches and saints, and went on pilgrimages. These actions did nothing to prevent the spread of the plague. The plague was highly contagious, and it was impossible to contain. Medieval medicine did not understand the true cause of the plague. They were unaware of the role of fleas in spreading the disease.

In the unit system of MKS, in which electric charge is measured in units of coulombs and time is measured in units of seconds, the force on a charged particle is measured in units of newtons. In the unit system of Gaussian, in which electric charge is measured in units of statC and time is measured in units of seconds, the force on a charged particle is measured in units of dyne."}
