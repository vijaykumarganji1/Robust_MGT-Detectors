{"original_text": "Since different breeds of dogs have different proportions, weight alone cannot allow you to determine an appropriately-sized cage. [substeps] Measure your dog at its widest, tallest, and longest points, then multiply those measurements together to determine your dog's size. Add 1-2 inches to those measurements to determine your dog's cage size. TIP: Remember to measure from the floor to the top of your dog's head and back, not just from head to tail. Here are the recommended cage sizes for different breeds. Because most dogs are prone to chewing, we recommend using a welded cage rather than a bolted one. This prevents your dog from chewing and escaping from the cage. TIP: Avoid wire cages with large mesh or wire diameters. These can cause your dog to cut or puncture its paws. We've found that plastic or poly-coated cages are easier to clean and more sanitary than wire or steel ones. TIP: If you're concerned about your dog being able to chew through the cage, opt for a poly-coated wire cage. Finally, we recommend that your cage have a top that your dog cannot remove. TIP: The top should be secure enough that your dog cannot chew or push it off. Pet cages come in a variety of colors and styles. However, make sure that you consider your dog's needs over your own aesthetic choices. If you're concerned that your dog will chew on its cage, opt for a cage with a plastic or poly-coated finish. We recommend cages with large doors that allow you to remove your dog easily. TIP: Some cages come with removable trays, which make cleaning a breeze. If you're housing multiple dogs or have a smaller dog, consider purchasing an enclosure with multiple cages. TIP: If you're housing multiple dogs, make sure that they are able to see each other. We recommend that you avoid cages with small openings. These can be dangerous for your dog, particularly if it is a puppy. TIP: Make sure that your cage is big enough to allow your dog to stand upright. In order to keep your dog comfortable, opt for a cage with a soft, padded mattress. For your convenience, consider purchasing a cage with wheels. TIP: If you're housing multiple dogs, make sure that the cage is big enough for you to comfortably fit your hand in order to pet them. TIP: Some cages come with built-in bowls, making feeding time more convenient.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "If you're buying a cage for the first time, it's a good idea to know your dog's breed before you buy it."}

{"original_text": "Without the rods, your cat would not be able to see very well in dark areas, like a hallway. You may notice your cat avoiding dark areas of your home. Just like people, as cat's age their vision will worsen. Cat's vision is similar to a human who has nearsightedness. They will see better up close, but the distance is more blurry. You may notice that your cat is not as interested in playing with toys. Cat's have a third eyelid that is known as the nictitating membrane. This membrane can sometimes become inflamed and turn red. It is important to take your cat to the vet, as this could be a sign of a serious medical condition. When cat's eyes are dry, you may notice that they will blink more often. You may also notice that they have some discharge. The discharge can be either clear or have some mucus in it. If your cat is squinting, it may be because they have an injury. Take your cat to the vet to have it checked out. When cat's have an infection, they may show signs of redness and swelling. They may also have a discharge coming from the eyes. When cat's are stressed, you may notice that they are blinking more. Most cat's don't like having their eyes touched. Even if your cat is blind, they can sense when you are near their face. If you notice that your cat has red, irritated, or discharge from their eyes, you should take them to the vet to have it checked out. When you have a cat, it is important to make sure that they have a healthy diet. Feeding your cat a high quality food can help them maintain a healthy weight, have healthy skin and coat, and can also improve their vision. There are many different options available when it comes to cat food. You can feed your cat dry food, canned food, or raw food. Each type of cat food has its own advantages and disadvantages. One thing you need to be careful of is choosing cat food that is too high in protein. Cats cannot process protein very well, so if they eat too much it can cause them to have kidney issues. Dry cat food is an affordable option that is highly convenient for cat owners. Dry cat food can be left out for the cat to eat throughout the day. This is a good option for cat's that are overweight or have a tendency to overeat. The food is also good for cat's with dental issues. Canned cat food has the advantage of having more moisture than dry food. The moisture can help cats who don't drink a lot of water or those who have a tendency to get urinary tract infections. Canned cat food also has a higher smell factor, which can make it easier to get a cat to eat. Raw cat food is a healthy option for cat's. Raw cat food will still have all of the nutrients and enzymes that are not found in other types of cat food. Raw cat food is also high in protein, which is important for cat's. One thing you need to be careful of when you choose cat food is to avoid cheap cat food. Cheap cat food is high in filler, which is not good for cat's. It can also be filled with unhealthy ingredients. There are many different brands of cat food available. The most important thing to look at is the ingredients. You want to choose a cat food that has high quality meat as the first ingredient. If the meat is not the first ingredient, the food is mostly filler. When you are looking at the ingredient list, you should also look at what type of meat it is. You want to choose cat food that has real meat. This can include things like chicken, turkey, lamb, or beef. Canned cat food should not have a lot of filler ingredients. Many cat food companies will fill their canned cat food with corn or soy. These ingredients are not good for cats. You should also look at the types of ingredients that are used. You want to look for cat food that does not contain ingredients like by-products. Cat food that has grains and filler ingredients can cause cat's to become overweight. This can lead to a lot of health problems. When you are choosing cat food, you should look for food that has plenty of vitamins and minerals.

She waits for a few moments, then begins to walk out of the room. As she reaches the door, a photograph flashes in front of her, and she sees herself sitting in the chair, her face beaming with confidence. \"That's a good picture of you,\" someone says. \"Thank you,\" she replies. \"I'm really proud of it.\" \"I'll bet you are,\" the voice says. \"You should be.

You can also search online for therapists who treat your mental illness and use your health insurance. If you don't already have a therapist or psychologist, ask your doctor for a referral. You can also search online for therapists who treat your mental illness and use your health insurance. Educate yourself about your illness. Knowledge is power. You can find out about your illness by searching online or visiting your local library. The more you know about your illness, the more likely you are to overcome it. Accept your illness. The first step to overcoming any mental illness is to accept that you have it. This is not your fault. Nobody chooses to be mentally ill. It's not weakness or laziness. Nobody chooses to have diabetes or cancer, either. But you can choose to overcome your mental illness. Start to consider recovery. Recovery from mental illness is a long process. You should set realistic, small goals for yourself. Prioritize your treatment. Your mental illness is the most important thing in your life. You should schedule therapy appointments ahead of other commitments, and you should not make any other plans that interfere with your therapy appointments. Understand that treatment requires time and commitment. Treatment for mental illness is usually a long process. Most people go through several different treatments before they find the right one. Find a support group. Support groups provide a safe environment for people with similar mental illnesses to come together and talk about their feelings. Join a support group. This could be online, in person, or a combination. In a support group, you can ask others about their experience with therapy. Educate your family and friends. If your family and friends don't understand your illness, they will not be able to provide you with the support you need to get better. Be honest with your family and friends. This does not mean that you should be negative about yourself or your illness, but you should not be afraid to talk about it. The more you talk about your illness, the less shame you will feel. Encourage your family and friends to educate themselves. You can give them books or articles to read. Teach your family and friends what to do during a mental health crisis. You should teach them how to talk to you, what to say and what not to say. You should also teach them how to talk to you about getting treatment. You can give them sample scripts. Ask your family and friends to encourage you to get better. If you are having a bad day, tell them to say things like \"I'm proud of you\" or \"I'm here for you.\" Try to stick to a schedule. A schedule will help you get back on track. You can create a schedule for your therapy appointments, medication schedule, and workschoolchores. Plan for triggers. Triggers are things that make you feel bad. For example, if a person who broke up with you calls you, this could be a trigger. If you have a trigger, you should try to avoid it. If you can't avoid it, you should plan a way to deal with the trigger. Avoid self-medication. Many people with mental illness turn to alcohol or drugs as a coping mechanism. This is not a good way to treat your illness. In fact, it will make it worse. Don't smoke. Smoking is bad for you. The chemicals in cigarettes will worsen your mental illness. If you are a smoker, you should consider quitting. Create a crisis plan. A crisis plan is a plan for what to do when you have a mental health crisis. You should give this to your therapist, family and friends. It should include contact information for your therapist and familyfriends. It should also include information about what you should do in case of a mental health crisis.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Here are some tips from the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) on how to overcome mental illness: If you already have a therapist or psychologist, ask them for a referral."}

One day, her teleporting ability causes her to go to a strange place called Hourglass. In Hourglass, she meets many other people like her. After a while, she becomes friends with them.

Once you've collected everything you need, place the can on a flat surface and push the nail through the center of the can, where it curves in. Push the nail in all the way, and pull it out. You should see a tiny hole. Next, you're going to be using your thumb to push the plastic lid up and out of the can. Start by putting your thumb on the top of the lid, and pressing the lid inwards. As you do this, you should start to feel the lid start to come off the can. Continue to push until the lid pops up and off. You may have a little bit of plastic sticking out, which is okay. The only important thing is that the lid is off. With your thumb, you're going to push on the inside of the can. It's important to push at the edge of the plastic, where the metal of the can ends. You may feel the metal start to bend. Keep pushing until you can feel the metal give, and you can see the metal bending inwards. With your thumb, you're going to keep pushing until the metal is bent over far enough to catch the edge of the lid. Once it's bent inwards, the can should be sealed again. Now you have a can that is both airtight and open. All you have to do is unscrew the lid to access the food inside. As long as the lid is screwed on tightly, the can should be completely sealed. It's a great way to keep food fresh for longer, without the risk of it going bad. This is a great life hack to use for any food that you want to keep fresh in the fridge, but don't want to have to open every time. You can use the same life hack to store food in cans that don't have lids, such as salsa or tomato paste. You can even use it for anything you want to store, such as jewelry or other small items.

There are many reasons that sibling rivalry begins. Some of the reasons are:. Researchers believe that there are many other factors that influence sibling rivalry, such as birth order, personality, and genetics. Birth order can influence the way that children get along with each other. Children who are born first, and are therefore the oldest, tend to be natural leaders. They can be bossy and manipulative. They may enjoy being in control of their younger siblings. Younger siblings often want to break away from the older siblings' control and have some power of their own. Sibling rivalry may be worse if children are born close together in age. Younger children may feel that they are always playing catch up to the older sibling.

Sibling rivalry can also become severe when one child is abused. This may lead to severe sibling rivalry. Sibling rivalry can also be influenced by parents' behavior. If one child is favored over the other, the favored child may begin to feel superior to the other child. The child who is not favored may feel inferior. Children who feel inferior may start to fight with the favored child. Children who are not favored may start to misbehave, because they feel that they are being ignored. This may lead to more severe sibling rivalry. It is important that parents try to treat all of their children fairly. They should spend time with each child individually, and as a family. Parents should have firm rules that apply to everyone in the family. They should also praise and reward each child for good behavior. Parents should encourage their children to work out their problems, and not to use physical aggression. It is important that parents be consistent in enforcing the rules.

A documentary on the Yellowknife Dene entitled: \"The Land is Our Life\" was shown to the students. Following the viewing, the students were led through a presentation on traditional Dene culture. The presentation was given by several students from the Yellowknife Dene community. As a culmination to their studies, the grade 12 class travelled to the Dene community to take part in a number of traditional activities. The day was divided into two main sections, with a morning devoted to traditional fishing, hunting and trapping activities, and an afternoon spent at the Dene Cultural Centre. The morning was spent at the Cameron River, where the students had the opportunity to try their hand at ice fishing, net fishing, trapping and dry fish preparation. \"This was such a great experience. I've never seen the Dene fishing before, so this was very interesting,\" said Heather Kryzanowsky. \"It's really cold here,\" said Rebecca Smith, who, along with her classmates, took a break to warm up by the fire. At the Dene Cultural Centre, the students were welcomed by Elders. \"The students are very lucky to have this opportunity,\" said Elder Adam Moosetail. \"This is a very special experience for the students, especially now that we have the Cultural Centre,\" he added. The students were treated to a Dene lunch of caribou, moose and bannock. After lunch, the students went to the centre's museum, where they were treated to a presentation by Dene elders. The students then went to the centre's art gallery, where they had the opportunity to see some of the artwork done by local Dene artists. The students were very impressed with the artwork. \"I can't believe how talented these artists are,\" said Nicole St. Jean. \"I think these artists are amazing,\" added Heather Kryzanowsky. This has been an incredible experience for these students, many of whom have never been to the Dene community before. It is hoped that this trip will foster greater understanding and respect between the students and the Dene community. \"This was a great experience,\" said Heather Kryzanowsky. \"I've never been to the Dene community before, but I'll definitely be back.\" \"This was a great day for the students,\" said teacher Linda Sutherland. \"It's so important that the students learn about the Dene, and we're very grateful to the Dene community for allowing us to come here.\"", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Students from the Charles S.

If your teen loves helping people, think about careers like nursing, physical therapy, or elder care. If your teen is interested in marketing, consider advertising, social media, or public relations. Take time to sit down with your teen and discuss possible careers. Ask what careers interest your teen. Why do they interest your teen? What skills are necessary for a career in a particular field? How much education is necessary? What is the average starting salary? You can also encourage your teen to take career assessments. Many of these can be found online. Many colleges and universities have similar career assessments available for students to take. Encourage your teen to apply for jobs or internships in a variety of fields. In addition to building valuable skills, a job or internship helps teens explore career options. It also helps them figure out what type of work environment they want to work in. If your teen wants to work in a certain industry but cannot find a job or internship, encourage them to shadow a professional. They can learn about the day-to-day tasks, as well as the pros and cons of the career. Talk to friends, neighbors, and other parents to see if they know of anyone who works in the industry your teen wants to explore. If you don't know anyone, ask your teen's teachers and school counselors. Volunteering is another way your teen can explore different careers. They can choose to volunteer in a variety of fields. They can even choose to volunteer in a different field than their desired career. Volunteering is a great way to develop skills that will benefit your teen's career. It is also a great way to meet others who are working in different fields. You never know who your teen will meet. Colleges and universities provide a variety of opportunities for students to explore careers. Many provide mentorship programs for students to explore career opportunities. They also provide internship and volunteer opportunities. Your teen's school may also provide career-related programs or courses. If they don't, the school counselor can be a great resource for career exploration. Encourage your teen to talk to their college advisor or the career center to explore career opportunities.

As he walks through the fields, he points out various plant species that have been carefully nurtured and protected to ensure that the native species are not overtaken by nonnative plants. He walks to an overlook from which a broad expanse of woodland can be seen. \"We've already planted thousands of trees on this site,\" he says, \"and there's more to come. I don't know if there's anywhere else in the world where an institution of higher education has made this kind of investment in its natural environment.\" The woodland he describes is part of the Piedmont Physiographic Province, one of the eight provinces comprising the state's geographic regions. The word \"Piedmont\" is French for \"foot of the mountain,\" and it accurately describes the physical characteristics of the land that stretches from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Atlantic Coastal Plain. \"We're standing at the edge of the Piedmont Plateau, looking down toward the Coastal Plain,\" says Jim Flueck, an associate professor of biology at UGA and one of the experts who helped shape the plans for the university's new campus. \"The Piedmont is an area of gently rolling hills and relatively low elevations, while the Blue Ridge Mountains to the north and the Atlantic Coastal Plain to the south are more dramatic in their topography. \"In the state of Georgia, the Piedmont forms a transition area between the two,\" he continues. \"It's part of the Piedmont physiographic province, and it's a very diverse environment with a wide variety of plant and animal species. It's an environment that's attractive to human beings, and it's also the environment that the University of Georgia has occupied since 1801.\" What is the Piedmont? As the name implies, the Piedmont region stretches from the mountains to the coast, and it is home to Georgia's capital city, Atlanta, which sits on the Piedmont Plateau. The plateau is divided into three major sections: the Blue Ridge Province to the north, the Piedmont Upland Province in the center and the Fall Line Lowland Province in the south. The highest elevation in the Piedmont is on Brasstown Bald, the state's highest mountain, which reaches an elevation of 4,784 feet. The lowest elevation is found in the Fall Line Lowlands. The Piedmont is sometimes called the Piedmont Plain because it is characterized by gently rolling hills and low elevations. The Piedmont Upland Province, which is located in the center of the Piedmont region, is generally more rugged than the other two provinces, and it is home to the Pine Mountain, the longest mountain ridge in Georgia. The Piedmont is about 135 miles wide and 300 miles long, and it includes all or part of the following counties: Around Atlanta, the Piedmont Plateau is divided into two sections, the Stone Mountain Section and the Lithonia Section. The Stone Mountain Section extends from Atlanta northward to the Georgia-South Carolina border. The Lithonia Section includes the area east of Atlanta and south of Stone Mountain. The Piedmont is a physiographic province, which is a region of land that has common geologic characteristics. The Piedmont province is one of eight physiographic provinces in Georgia. The Piedmont is a transition area between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Its climate and geology are more similar to the Coastal Plain than to the Blue Ridge. The Piedmont is divided into three sections: the Blue Ridge Province to the north, the Piedmont Upland Province in the center and the Fall Line Lowland Province in the south. Geologic characteristics of the Piedmont The Piedmont is largely composed of granite, gneiss, schist and other metamorphic rock. The Blue Ridge Province in the northern part of the Piedmont is more mountainous than the other two provinces. The Fall Line Lowland Province in the southern part of the Piedmont is more flat.

If you live in the northern hemisphere, you can prune your lantana in late fall or early spring. If you live in the southern hemisphere, prune in spring or summer. Lantana pruning is done by removing damaged, dead or diseased leaves and stems. You can also prune to help control the size of the plant and to shape it to your liking. Cut the stems at a 45-degree angle, which helps the stems heal faster. Prune lantana plants by first removing damaged leaves and stems. Cut off any leaves or stems that are diseased, dead or rotting. If you are doing lantana pruning to control size, cut the lantana back by about a third. If you are pruning to shape your plant, make sure to leave several inches of new growth.

{"original_text": "If your child is young, talk to them about the different feelings that they may experience. As your child becomes familiar with their emotions, ask them to identify how they feel. When they feel angry or sad, encourage them to tell you what is making them feel that way. Try to come up with ways for them to work through it. With older children, it can be difficult to differentiate between a teenager's natural moodiness and a more serious problem. If your child seems to be more than just temporarily depressed or unhappy, and there are drastic changes in their behavior, it may be a good idea to have them evaluated by a mental health professional. What if I have a mental illness myself? When you are diagnosed with a mental illness, the first priority is to make sure you are receiving the proper treatment. With the right support and treatment, you can lead a normal life. If you have children, it is important to learn as much as you can about your illness. Understand how it may affect you and your child. When talking to your child about your illness, it is important to keep a few things in mind. Make sure to speak in a way that is appropriate for their age. Children under the age of 12 may not be able to fully understand. There is no need to go into details, but explain the basics, such as how you are feeling and how treatment will help. How do I help my child deal with a mental illness? It is difficult to see your child suffer. If you are unsure of how to help, it is important to talk to your child's doctor. They can give you specific advice on how to handle your child's situation. Be supportive. Encourage your child to get help. Offer to accompany them to appointments. Help them understand that they are not to blame for their illness. If you believe your child may be at risk of harming themselves, you need to take action. Remove any weapons from your home, including firearms. Talk to your child's doctor. If you are concerned that they may act on suicidal thoughts, seek help immediately.

{"original_text": "Decide what your approach or angle on the story is going to be. [substeps] For example, you can start with a simple plot like, your main character has to deal with a problem, then use it as a springboard to tie it into a bigger theme. Or you can start with a theme and build a plot around that. Check out the plot that you have devised so far, and identify the biggest plot holes. What are the missing steps or elements that are vital to the story? [substeps] For example, if your character has to break into a prison, the logical question would be, how is he going to do that? If he does not have a plan, then the plot will be weak. Brainstorm ideas for the missing elements, and integrate them into the plot. Go through the plot again and identify the second-largest plot hole, and repeat the process for step 3. Repeat step 4 for all the smaller plot holes that you have identified. Some plot holes will not be so easy to fill. For example, maybe your character has to kill a villain, but you do not want to break the rules. Then you can add something else that will make the villain's death plausible. For example, you can have your character find a sword that can kill the villain, or he can have a gun that can blow him up, but he refuses to use it because he is a pacifist. Then, he can find a way to make the villain kill himself. Do this until all the plot holes have been filled. Ask a friend to read your plot and tell you if there are any plot holes that you might have missed. If you really have no idea where to start or if you want to be inspired, consider reading or watching some of the following stories. Write your plot down in a word document. Ideally, your plot should be no longer than a page, so you do not have to add too many details and descriptions. A plot is the sequence of events that form the story of a movie or book.

However, it can cause certain side effects, such as heartburn, nausea, and mouth irritation. If you have a health condition, talk to your doctor before trying ginger tea. Ginger is one of the world's healthiest foods. In fact, it's been used as a natural remedy for thousands of years. Its active compounds have been shown to relieve nausea, reduce inflammation, and protect against diseases. Here are 10 proven health benefits of ginger. If you have digestive issues, ginger may be especially helpful. It's been shown to speed up emptying of the stomach, especially when there are delays in the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine (1, 2). In one study, consuming 1.2 grams of ginger powder before a meal reduced indigestion and stomach discomfort in people with indigestion (3). Ginger has also been shown to help relieve nausea and vomiting. In a review of 12 studies, ginger was found to be more effective than a placebo in preventing nausea caused by morning sickness or chemotherapy (4). Another study found that ginger may relieve nausea caused by motion sickness. In this study, 12 to 18-year-olds who took 1 gram of ginger powder had less nausea and vomiting than those who took a placebo (5). Summary Ginger may help relieve indigestion, nausea, and vomiting. Inflammation is one of the leading drivers of many common Western diseases. Interestingly, ginger contains compounds that may help reduce inflammation. In a test-tube study, ginger extract reduced the production of nitric oxide, which is believed to play a role in inflammation. In addition, animal research has shown that ginger may help reduce joint inflammation in those with arthritis (6, 7). In one study in 247 people with osteoarthritis, those who took ginger extract had less pain and required less pain medication than those who took a placebo.

{"original_text": "[substeps] For men's styles, the super skinny cuff works for jeans that are slim and straight-legged. These jeans can also be labeled \" skinny \" or \" slim fit \" styles. Anything with a straight or very gently tapered leg can be paired with the slim cuff. This cuff length is a bit longer than the super skinny cuff, and is a good choice for men's jeans that are more relaxed or boot-cut than skinny. The classic or regular cuff is the average length of men's jean cuffs. It is also the standard cuff length for women's skinny jeans. This cuff length will work for both slim and straight leg jeans, and will provide a longer, more laid-back look. The cuff in this length is perfect for boyfriend jeans, and will also work with jeans that have a straight leg. This is the cuff that works best with boot-cut jeans, as well as more classic and casual styles. The extra length of this cuff will not only give you a more dressed-down look, but will also provide some extra warmth on cool days. If you're thinking of rolling up your jeans, you'll need to look at the fabric and stitching of the hem to see how it will react to the process. For example, it's more difficult to roll cotton and canvas jeans because these fabrics are stiff and do not stretch. This makes it more difficult to roll up the fabric to create a cuff, but also makes it easier to keep a cuff rolled up because the stiffness of the fabric will help hold the rolled hem in place. Denim jeans made with elastic, spandex, or a blend of stretchy and stiff fabrics can be rolled up more easily, but may not keep their rolled cuffs in place as well. Tight jeans are difficult to roll up, but can be rolled with a little practice. Folding the bottom of a tight pair of jeans over once will create a small cuff that won't be too difficult to walk in. Tight jeans can also be rolled several times to create a larger cuff, but this can be quite difficult because the fabric of tight jeans is very stiff. Boot-cut jeans are easy to roll, especially when you want to create a cuff that will cover most of your shoe. While you can roll up boot-cut jeans more than once to create a larger cuff, you probably don't need to do this because the loose fit of boot-cut jeans will create a cuff that is long enough to fold over a few times. Slim fit jeans are easy to roll up and are more forgiving than skinny jeans. If you are looking to create a rolled cuff that will cover a large portion of your shoe, you may need to roll the slim fit jeans up a couple of times. Skinny jeans are difficult to roll up, and even more difficult to walk in. The fabric of skinny jeans is stretchy, which makes it difficult to create a tight cuff that will hold in place. Do you wear your jeans with the cuffs rolled up or down? Down, and I prefer them this way. Down, but I don't really have a preference. Up, and I prefer them this way. Up, but I don't really have a preference. I don't wear rolled up jeans. Choose a pair of jeans that will be easy to roll, and that will also look good rolled up. Don't roll up skinny jeans unless you want a sloppy, tight cuff that won't stay in place. Rolling up your jeans is not difficult, but it does take practice. There are a couple of different ways to roll your jeans. You can also use your hands to create the cuff. Just fold the hem of the jeans up and over several times, and then use your thumb and forefinger to roll the fabric over itself. Place your foot in the jean leg, and push the rolled hem up the leg until it covers the top of your shoe. Tuck the rolled edge of the cuff into the back of your jeans. This will keep the cuff in place. Alternatively, you can use a belt to secure the rolled hem. This will also keep the cuff in place. Most men's jeans have a 32\" inseam. The inseam is the measurement from the crotch to the hem of the jean.

Diarrhea: Symptoms Treatment VCA Animal Hospitals Diarrhea is an increase in the frequency and looseness of bowel movements. The pet may or may not have an increase in the volume of feces. Sometimes the diarrhea is mixed in with normal stool, especially in cats. There may be blood in the stool. Diarrhea is not a disease but is a sign of disease. Causes of diarrhea include infectious diseases, such as viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections; endocrine diseases, such as hyperthyroidism and diabetes mellitus; inflammatory conditions of the bowel, such as inflammatory bowel disease, whipworms, and dietary allergies; cancer; kidney diseases; and ingestion of toxic substances. Vomiting, loss of appetite, and dehydration often accompany diarrhea. If your pet shows any of these signs, especially if there is blood in the stool, contact your veterinarian. If your pet has mild diarrhea, then a prescription or a change in diet may be all that is necessary. For severe or chronic diarrhea, more tests, such as blood tests, bacterial culture, and intestinal parasite tests, may be necessary. The treatment for diarrhea depends on its underlying cause. The best way to prevent diarrhea is to prevent your pet from eating things it shouldn't. Keep garbage cans covered, and put dangerous substances, such as antifreeze, up high and out of reach. Take your pet to the veterinarian for regular checkups and whenever you notice something unusual. Certain animals, such as hamsters, guinea pigs, and chinchillas, are especially sensitive to viral and bacterial diarrheas. If your pet has diarrhea, it should be isolated from other animals. If your pet has diarrhea, it is important to keep it hydrated. Giving your pet plenty of water will help replace lost fluids and electrolytes. If your pet is vomiting, small amounts of food and water may be offered frequently. Water can also be given by subcutaneous injection. If your pet has diarrhea, it is important to keep it hydrated. Pet owners should call their veterinarian if their pet has diarrhea that does not resolve within 24 hours. The veterinarian will probably recommend a physical examination. Blood tests may be needed to rule out an underlying disease, such as kidney failure, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes. A urinalysis may be necessary to rule out kidney disease, which can cause diarrhea. X-rays and ultrasound may be recommended to look for problems in the abdomen, such as cancer or intestinal obstruction. Stool samples may be necessary to rule out infectious diseases and parasites, and to look for inflammatory cells that may indicate inflammatory bowel disease. An infectious cause, such as bacterial or viral infection, can be treated with antibiotics or anti-viral medications. Anti-inflammatory medications may be used to treat inflammatory bowel disease or other inflammatory disorders. If the cause is cancer, the best treatment option may be surgical removal of the tumor. If your pet has diarrhea, it is important to keep it hydrated. Giving your pet plenty of water will help replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Water can be offered in a drinking bowl or via a syringe without a needle. If your pet is vomiting, small amounts of food and water may be offered frequently.

{"original_text": "If this is your first time dyeing your hair, you may want to try using temporary or semi-permanent dye rather than permanent dye. [substeps] Temporary dyes tend to wash out quicker, which is great if you're just trying out a color but you're not sure if you like it. Semi-permanent dyes last a little longer but still wash out after several weeks. Permanent dyes are the longest-lasting option and require professional dye-removing treatments to get rid of. Choose the best dye for your hair type. If you have dry, frizzy hair, you'll want to avoid bleaching your hair as well as using very harsh, drying dyes. You should also avoid using semi-permanent dyes because these dyes are meant to be absorbed into the hair shaft, which can be damaging to dry hair. Choose a warm brown to add a little color and depth to your hair. Warm browns will work for all hair types, but if you have dark hair, you may want to add blonde highlights to the dye for a softer effect. If you have a lot of grays, choose a neutral brown instead of a warm brown. Choose a cool brown to add dimension and create the illusion of thickness. If you have dark hair, use a light cool brown instead of a dark cool brown. If you have light hair, use a dark cool brown instead of a light cool brown. Cool brown dyes work well for all hair types. Choose a red brown if you have dark hair. Red browns work well for adding a little depth and warmth to dark hair, especially if your hair is naturally dull. If you have light hair, opt for a neutral brown instead. Choose an ash brown if you have light hair. Ash brown dyes work well for adding dimension to light hair, especially if your hair is naturally dull or thin. If you have dark hair, opt for a light cool brown instead. Choose a copper brown if you have light hair. Copper brown dyes work well for adding warmth to light hair, especially if your hair is naturally dull. If you have dark hair, opt for a dark cool brown instead. Choose a light blonde brown if you have dark hair. Light blonde brown dyes work well for adding warmth and depth to dark hair, especially if your hair is naturally dull. If you have light hair, opt for a light cool brown instead. Add highlights to your hair. If you want to add a little extra depth to your hair, try adding a few highlights to your dye. If you're using permanent hair dye, you'll need to bleach your hair first. If you want to add some dimension to your hair, apply the highlights around your face, especially around your cheekbones and forehead. If you're worried about the damage that bleaching will do to your hair, try using a semi-permanent dye or a temporary dye to add the highlights instead. Permanent dye has been specially formulated to color and dye your hair. If you want your new hair color to last for a while, go with a permanent hair dye. Semi-permanent dyes are longer-lasting than temporary dyes. They will wash out after a few weeks rather than a few days. Temporary hair dye will wash out within a few days. Choose a permanent hair dye if this is your first time dying your hair. This will help you see how the color looks on your hair before you commit to a new look. Ask for a color sample at your local drug store or beauty supply store. You can ask for a sample of any of the colors you're interested in. The sample will be a few inches of hair dye. You'll usually get about 1 or 2 samples for free. If you need more, ask the clerk if they can give you another one. If the clerk tells you that you can't have samples, you can always ask for a few inches of the color at the register. Most beauty stores will give you some of the dye for free if you ask for it. Apply the color to your hair. Section off a piece of hair and dye it. This will give you a good idea of how the color will look on your hair.
