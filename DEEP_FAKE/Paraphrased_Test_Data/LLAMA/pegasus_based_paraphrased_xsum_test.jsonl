{"original_text": "They say the parts, possibly from a Buk surface-to-air system, are \"of particular interest\" and could help show who was behind the crash. But they say they have not proved who was responsible. The Buk missile system is said to have been used to shoot down MH17. The aircraft was hit by a Russian-made Buk missile over rebel-held eastern Ukraine on 17 July 2014. More than 298 people were killed. Most were Dutch. The investigators said the parts were found in Ukraine. \"Although we cannot say with 100 certainty that there is a connection between the discovered parts and Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, we are convinced that there is.\" They said the parts - a missile engine and fragments of the nose - were \"probably\" from a Buk, which is believed to have been fired from a field near Pervomaisk, a town held by pro-Russian separatists. The investigators said the parts were found in fields in Ukraine \"in the period September 2016 to May 2018.\" It was not clear whether the missile parts came from the same Buk missile. One of the items had been \"secured\" by the investigators. \"The parts are of particular interest to the criminal investigation as they can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17,\" the investigators said in a statement. \"For that reason the JIT preserves every possibility to use the found parts for forensic research.\" What was MH17 and what happened to it? The Malaysia Airlines plane was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was blown apart in mid-air, crashing in a field in the Donetsk area, in territory held by Russian-backed rebels. There were no survivors. Most of those killed were Dutch, but people from 17 countries were among the dead, including 38 Australians. The investigators said the missile was fired from a field near Pervomaisk, a town held by pro-Russian separatists. In May, they named three Russians and a Ukrainian as suspects in the shooting down of MH17. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) did not name them, but said they were Russian nationals Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov, as well as Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko. The Dutch-led team says it has \"irrefutable evidence\" that the plane was hit by a Russian-made Buk missile fired from rebel-controlled territory. The investigators also said they had identified a \"separate, as yet unnamed, suspect, who is involved in the transporting of the Buk missile system from the territory of the Russian Federation to eastern-Ukraine.\" They did not say where that suspect was based or whether they were believed to have been part of the chain of command that had ordered the missile launch. The suspects will be prosecuted in the Netherlands - all face charges of murder and causing the crash of MH17. Three of the suspects are likely to be tried in absentia as Russia does not extradite its citizens. The fourth man is believed to be in Ukraine. The JIT has called on the Russian government to co-operate, saying it is \"in the interest of the relatives of the victims that those responsible for this crime be held to account.\" Russia has consistently denied any involvement in the incident. A spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry said the new findings were \"nothing more than a cover-up for the unwillingness of the official investigation to conduct an objective probe.\" What was the reaction to the MH17 investigation? The Dutch-led team leading the criminal investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 says its findings are irrefutable. But Russia - which denies any involvement - says only a proper impartial investigation can determine who was responsible for the tragedy. In a lengthy statement, the Russian foreign ministry said it believed the investigation was biased and conducted \"in the interests of only one party.\" The Dutch-led team said it was \"calling on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and co-operate\" with the criminal investigation. The separatists also deny shooting down the airliner.

The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) wants train companies to refund passengers who accidentally buy the wrong ticket. Train tickets can be confusing, especially with so many ticket types now available for different journeys. Although it's important to pay the right price, you can find yourself being overcharged if you don't pick the right ticket. What's the difference between Advance, Super Off-Peak and Off-Peak tickets? Advance tickets are often the cheapest you can buy. You can book them up to 12 weeks in advance but you must travel at a specific time on a specific train. Super Off-Peak tickets are usually cheaper than Off-Peak tickets but are limited in availability. You can travel on them at any time on the date printed on the ticket, but you're restricted to certain trains. Off-Peak tickets are valid on any train but the cheapest Off-Peak tickets don't let you travel in the morning or evening when it's most likely that people will be commuting. These are just some examples of the cheapest ticket types. Your train operator might have different names for them, or different terms and conditions for when you can travel. If you need to buy a ticket on the day, it's worth shopping around as prices vary from operator to operator. When you buy a ticket, you'll probably have to choose whether to buy a standard or first class ticket. First class tickets can be twice the price of a standard ticket. If you're travelling by train a lot, you might want to consider a railcard. For example, a 16-25 Railcard offers a 30 discount on most train tickets, and can be used by anyone aged 16-25, or over-25s in full-time education. Can you get a refund if you've been overcharged? If you buy the wrong ticket, your train company can refund you if you ask. If your train company doesn't give you a refund, you can complain to the rail ombudsman, whose decision will be binding on the train company. Make sure you get a receipt when you buy a ticket, as you'll need this to claim a refund. How can you avoid overpaying? If you're not sure which ticket to buy, ask the member of staff on the station or in the train. It's their job to help you get the right ticket and find the best deal.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "A study by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) has found that more than a quarter of train passengers are paying too much or underpay for their train tickets."}

Updates on this story and others from Suffolk Police officers and the Environment Agency removed the waste, which they believe was unloaded using a tractor and trailer. Johnston was fined PS1000 plus costs of PS1600 after pleading guilty to fly-tipping at Bury St Edmunds Magistrates Court. In a statement, he said the rubbish had been unlawfully dumped on his own land before he moved it, and he later paid PS4,000 for it to be cleared up from the side of the road. Jonathan Reed, prosecuting on behalf of Mid Suffolk District Council said he was pleased the court had recognised the \"severity of the offences as well as the dangers to users of the highway.\""}

Dozens of people wearing military-style uniform, berets and dark glasses attended the funeral in Londonderry. Unionist politicians criticised the paramilitary display at the funeral in Londonderry on Saturday. But Edel Kelly said it was what her grandmother wanted. \"She meant the world to me, to my sisters and my brothers as well and to a whole lot of people in Derry, because everyone knew Peggy O'Hara,\" Ms Kelly said. \"My granny organised everything herself before her death, she wanted what happened at the wake and she wanted what happened at the funeral.\" It was reported earlier this week that shots were fired over Mrs O'Hara's coffin. The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) is a republican paramilitary group believed to have been responsible for more than 120 murders from its formation in 1975 until its ceasefire in 1998.

His dismissal comes after reports of tensions with Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who are both close advisors to President Trump. \"The fact is I would have done a lot of things a lot differently,\" Scaramucci said. \"I want to start off by telling you, Mr. President, that I apologize for the comments that I made last week,\" Scaramucci said in the statement. While addressing reporters on Air Force One, Trump said he had been preparing the statement for \"a couple of days.\" \"I certainly didn't mean any ill will and I think you saw the president has a great leadership decision today in picking General (John) Kelly to be the chief of staff,\" he said. Trump continued to praise Kelly, saying he will do a \"spectacular job\" as the new chief of staff. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. Having formerly served as a marine officer and combat veteran, Kelly took over as the Trump administration's secretary of homeland security in January. Mr Kelly was sworn in on Monday evening in a small ceremony, and the retired four-star Marine Corps general will be the President's second chief of staff, replacing Reince Priebus who was sacked on Friday. Scaramucci is the third person in that job in as many months. In his first appearance in front of the cameras in the White House press briefing room, Kelly said he would work to \"bring order, discipline and integrity\" back to the White House. It's hard to say what Scaramucci's legacy will be as a short-time White House staffer. \"I know I'm not going to be able to say the word \"f\" here today, so I'm not going to try,\" he joked. Trump's first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, had been a steadying influence on the mercurial president, but the two had grown increasingly distant over time. \"As far as I'm concerned, that's a thing of the past,\" he said. Kelly said he has been authorized to \"do whatever is necessary to enforce the [immigration] laws of the United States.\" \"If we have to go higher, we'll go higher.\" \"This will probably be the most important decision that he's made so far.\" He said the administration will work on the legislation with members of Congress, while also working to \"take the shackles off\" the country's immigration officers. Kelly said he would work to \"improve internal communication.\" \"The team here is remarkable.\" Along with his personal record, Kelly also is taking charge of the West Wing at a particularly hard moment. \"I think there will be things that I don't like that he does,\" Scaramucci said of Trump. He added that Kelly \"will do a spectacular job.\" Asked how long he will stay in the new role, Kelly said he didn't know \"how long I'll last.\" \"We should put the country first and have a good debate on policy.\" Kelly was brought in to bring order to the White House, after months of chaos.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Anthony Scaramucci, President Donald Trump's new White House communications director, has been fired, according to a statement released by the White House."}

Russian news agency Interfax says seven people died. The European Union says it is 'appalled' by the reports. The United States State Department called the reports 'very disturbing' but offered no confirmation. Russia has rejected similar allegations in the past. The allegations came as the battle for the eastern Ghouta district on the outskirts of Damascus entered its third day. The area has been under rebel control since the Syrian war began, but government forces have been escalating their efforts to take it recently. Government airstrikes and rocket fire have killed more than 1,000 people since Sunday, according to opposition activists. The International Committee for the Red Cross said the area is now 'a giant graveyard'. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said airstrikes on the town of Zamalka killed at least 30 people on Monday. The opposition-linked Syrian Civil Defense said victims of the attack showed symptoms of exposure to toxic gas. The World Health Organization said doctors in the area have reported patients displaying symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals. The U.N. Security Council is set to meet Tuesday to discuss the situation in Syria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says more than 350 civilians have died in the violence so far. It says the shelling has targeted hospitals and other civilian sites in an attempt to expel the rebels. United Nations humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock called the fighting 'a complete and utter disaster.' He said the U.N. hopes to deliver aid to eastern Ghouta on Tuesday, but that it could not confirm that. The International Committee for the Red Cross says conditions in the area are 'bleak.' It says the bombardment has destroyed much of the area's infrastructure, including five hospitals. The area is one of the last remaining rebel strongholds in Syria. The U.N. Security Council has demanded a 30-day humanitarian cease-fire in Syria. Russia and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces did not sign on to that demand. The U.N. estimates 400,000 people live in eastern Ghouta. The area has been under government siege since 2013. It has been targeted by government airstrikes and artillery fire many times.

World Rugby, the game's governing body, has welcomed Owens' decision to prolong his international career, adding he had shown exceptional fitness standards during the recent tournament. Owens admits the pressure, scrutiny and physical demands on referees are higher than ever, but he insists the passion for the job remains. \"I just thoroughly enjoy it and I'm going to keep on doing it as long as I can and as long as I'm good at it,\" he said. \"When the time is right and I know the body or the mind can't take it any more because of the travelling or the pressure, or when the legs can't get there to make those big decisions, then I'll know that and I will be calling it a day when that happens.\" Sections of the Australian media have criticised aspects of Owens' performance in the final, claiming he missed a forward pass in the passage of play that ended with Dan Carter kicking a penalty to stretch New Zealand's advantage to 9-3. Owens, though, says he has learned to deal with criticism, and feels his decisions on Saturday did not affect the eventual outcome. \"If you can't deal with criticism as a referee you just can't do this job,\" he said. \"There's something in you that helps you deal with that. \"It doesn't make it any nicer for me to hear criticism, especially if any criticism is personal. \"As long as you can look back on a game and say'I did my best, I gave it my all' that's what counts.\" Owens revealed he was hugged and thanked for a \"great game\" by Australia number eight David Pocock moments after the final whistle. \"For someone who's just missed out on winning the Webb Ellis Trophy to come up and do that to you says a lot about the integrity of the man himself and what a wonderful sport rugby is,\" added Owens. The Welsh village of Gowerton will be Owens' next destination for a Swalec League Division One West match with Crymych. Two weeks later, he will be in the south of France for Toulon's European Champions Cup tie with Bath. \"I could've had a weekend off this weekend - a couple of refs have taken a couple of weekends off,\" said Owens. \"But I'd rather be out there reffing, whether it's under-12s, a schools game, youth game, a Division One West game or a World Cup final.\"", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "Media playback is not supported on this device At 44 years old, Owens was the oldest of the 12 referees chosen for the World Cup, but his age will not prevent him from taking part in Japan in 2019.

It was all great fun but, without the elaborate set pieces of her Vegas production, Spears' shortcomings were left exposed. Her vocals rarely seemed to be coming from the microphone, while her dancing lacked attitude and bite. The choreography was over-reliant on hand gestures; and Spears showed a tendency to slip in and out of time, like a clockwork doll whose mechanism had worn out. Her biggest blunder came during the song Touch of My Hand, as she leant over a dancer's arm to initiate a backflip, but teetered on her heels and aborted the move. Frustratingly, Spears showed glimpses of her former glories - pulling off a series of impressive lifts, as well as a punchy dance breakdown during Womanizer - but the routines more often felt like they were stuck in the rehearsal room. Tabloids will undoubtedly criticise the star for miming (the producers insist she sings over a pre-recorded backing track) but, at this point, expecting Spears to sing live is like turning up at Nando's and ordering truffles: The only person you're disappointing is yourself. In the end, Spears has always played second fiddle to her songs - especially in the second half of her career, following a much-documented breakdown in 2007 that means her life is still controlled by a court-approved conservatorship - and those songs provided an unshakeable foundation to her act.

While EE dominated for speed, Three was a close second, and won out in the voice and text categories. Three's strong performance came as a surprise as it has the smallest market share of the four operators, and had also been the worst performer in the last study, conducted in the first half of 2017. \"Three has significantly improved its performance since our last report and has become a force to be reckoned with,\" said Hossein Moiin, CEO and cofounder of RootMetrics. \"It's not just the rise of Three that's significant, it's the decline of Vodafone. While Vodafone offered the fastest average speed in 2017, it's now in a distant third place. \"EE, the only operator to offer 4G across the whole of the UK, is also one of the only operators to offer 4G voice, and it's not surprising that its call quality is unrivalled.\" The research looked at data, text and voice performance, but it noted that in this year's study, voice calls were \"negligible\" for the majority of users. The company conducted 4G data tests across 12,660 locations across the UK, including 6,392 indoor locations. RootMetrics also conducted text and voice tests, and its researchers drove more than 21,900 miles in 156 cars, across 480 routes, while conducting the tests. EE won the overall award for the second time, due to its fastest data speeds. Three was in second place, with a significant increase in its data speeds, and a strong performance in voice and text. Vodafone came third, with O2 in fourth, largely due to its poor performance in text tests. \"While EE may have won the award, this is not an indication of overall performance,\" said Moiin. \"Three's text performance, and its close second place for speed, means that when it comes to the full range of mobile experiences, Three is a strong contender for the best overall performance. \"Our study is designed to provide the most detailed and accurate comparison of mobile network performance, and should be considered the definitive reference guide for mobile consumers. \"Our latest report shows that the gap between the networks is closer than ever, and when it comes to choosing a network, consumers have never had so much choice.\"", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "EE has been named the UK's best mobile network for the second year in a row, while Three has beaten Vodafone to the top spot for the first time."}

{"original_text": "In a town north of Paris, the two brothers suspected of carrying out the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine had been holed up at a printing warehouse. They have now been killed. The brothers accused of carrying out the attack on the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo were killed Friday after a standoff with police in Dammartin-en-Goele, north of Paris, in a day of violence that left 20 people dead. The manhunt came to an end Friday afternoon when police stormed a building in Dammartin-en-Goele where the two brothers, Cherif and Said Kouachi, had been holed up since the morning. The pair, who were accused of killing 12 people at Charlie Hebdo's offices on Wednesday, were killed, along with a hostage they had been holding at the building. The hostage-taking began early in the morning in Dammartin-en-Goele, where the brothers are believed to have fled after the attack on Wednesday. The brothers had hijacked a car after robbing a gas station, and driven it to a building near Charles de Gaulle airport. Once there, they forced a man into the building and took him hostage. The hostage-taker later said that he was \"not important\" compared with the life of the terrorists, and that he was only being held to prevent police from storming the building. He described the brothers as \"tense, stressed, scared, but determined to hold out,\" and said that they had told him that they would not give themselves up. The standoff ended just after 4pm, when police stormed the building. The brothers were killed, along with the hostage they had been holding. The hostage-taker was not injured. Police also evacuated the area around the building in Dammartin-en-Goele. One person was injured, and taken to hospital, although their life is not believed to be in danger. One of the Kouachi brothers told French media earlier that he would not surrender, and claimed that he had an accomplice outside the building who was ready to \"die with him.\" Police are still looking for the accomplice. The dramatic events came as police continued their search for Hayat Boumeddiene, the partner of Amedy Coulibaly, who killed a policewoman and four people in a kosher supermarket on Friday. Boumeddiene is believed to have fled the country, although a source close to the investigation told BFM TV that police had found no proof of this. The attacks on Charlie Hebdo and the kosher supermarket left 17 people dead.

Landa had built up a lead of 15 seconds on Jungels - a gap that would have seen him climb into the overall lead - before being reeled back by the peloton on the up-and-down finish into Peschici. Sunday's stage takes the riders into the high mountains for the first time since stage four, with a summit finish on the category-one Blockhaus ending a relatively flat 149km from Montenero di Bisaccia. 1.

{"original_text": "Dubbed \"carbon farming,\" researchers say the idea is economically competitive with high-tech carbon capture and storage projects. But critics say the idea could be have unforeseen, negative impacts including driving up food prices. The research has been published in the journal Earth System Dynamics. Jatropha curcas is a plant that originated in Central America and is very well adapted to harsh conditions including extremely arid deserts. It is already grown as a biofuel in some parts of the world because its seeds can produce oil. In this study, German scientists showed that one hectare of jatropha could capture up to 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. The researchers based their estimates on trees currently growing in trial plots in Egypt and in the Negev desert. \"The results are overwhelming,\" said Prof Klaus Becker, from the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart. \"There was good growth, a good response from these plants. I feel there will be no problem trying it on a much larger scale, for example ten thousand hectares in the beginning,\" he said. According to the researchers a plantation that would cover three percent of the Arabian desert would absorb all the CO2 produced by cars and trucks in Germany over a 20 year period. The scientists say that a critical element of the plan would be the availability of desalination facilities. This means that initially, any plantations would be confined to coastal areas. They are hoping to develop larger trials in desert areas of Oman or Qatar. Prof Becker says that unlike other schemes that just offset the carbon that people produce, the planting of jatropha could be a good, short term solution to climate change. \"I think it is a good idea because we are really extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - and it is completely different between extracting and preventing.\" According to the scientist's calculations the costs of curbing carbon dioxide via the planting of trees would be between 42 and 63 euros per tonne. This makes it competitive with other techniques, such as the more high tech carbon capture and storage (CCS). A number of countries are currently trialling this technology but it has yet to be deployed commercially. Growing jatropha not only soaks up CO2 but has other benefits. The plants would help to make desert areas more habitable, and the plant's seeds can be harvested for biofuel say the researchers, providing an economic return. \"Jatropha is ideal to be turned into biokerosene - it is even better than biodiesel,\" said Prof Becker. But other experts in this area are not convinced. They point to the fact that in 2007 and 2008 large numbers of jatropha trees were planted for biofuel, especially in Africa. But many of these ventures ended in tears, as the plants were not very successful in coping with dry conditions. Lucy Hurn is the biofuels campaign manager for the charity, Actionaid. She says that while jatropha was once seen as the great, green hope the reality was very different. \"When jatropha was introduced it was seen as a miracle crop, it would grow on scrubland or marginal land,\" she said. \"But there are often people who need marginal land to graze their animals, they are getting food from that area - we wouldn't class the land as marginal.\" She pointed out that jatropha is highly toxic and can pollute the land it is grown on, even in a desert. And she also had concerns about the fairness of the idea. \"It is still somebody else's land.

If that sounds all too familiar and you fancy keeping the whole thing a bit more spiritual this year without giving up your gadgets, here are five ways to enjoy Christmas online: Everyday Church Online, which launched in the UK in September, runs virtual services every Sunday for a net-based congregation from around the world. Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed. So far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker. \"There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,\" he says. \"The chat room is like the foyer of a church.\" Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included: Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons. \"We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,\" says Mr Parker. \"The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity.\" The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release. \"Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,\" he says. \"The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around. \"It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible.... and those stories help to light up the world.\" You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one \"Joseph Carpenter\" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. \"It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,\" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network. \"The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.\" However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being \"too religious.\" After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees. \"We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,\" says founder Roald Lidal. \"One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,\" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years. \"There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga.\" As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year. \"I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,\" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier. \"The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly.\" \"Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,\" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex. \"He was a great communicator.\" Sounds like a seal of approval to me.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "Let's not forget the traditional argument with your other half about whose job it was to buy all the batteries for the children's new toys - which are currently a source of tension because nobody can turn them on.

Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed. So far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker. \"There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,\" he says. \"The chat room is like the foyer of a church.\" Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included: Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons. \"We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,\" says Mr Parker. \"The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity.\" The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release. \"Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,\" he says. \"The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around. \"It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible.... and those stories help to light up the world.\" You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one \"Joseph Carpenter\" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. \"It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,\" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network. \"The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.\" However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being \"too religious.\" After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees. \"We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,\" says founder Roald Lidal. \"One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,\" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years. \"There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga.\" As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year. \"I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,\" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier. \"The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly.\" \"Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,\" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex. \"He was a great communicator.\" Sounds like a seal of approval to me."}
{"original_text": "According to organisers a record 3.6 million turned out to vote in the Scottish independence referendum. More than 100,000 of the total were 16 to 17-year-olds who had registered to vote for the first time. The turnout was a massive 84.6 of eligible voters. The result was No: 2,001,926 votes (55.3) and Yes: 1,617,989 (44.7). In other words the margin of victory was 450,000. So the Yes campaign won the battle of ideas but lost the war. The fact that the vote was so close was a stunning victory for the Yes side. The bookies had said that Yes would get 37 of the vote. In the end it was 45! Many commentators had said it was 60-40 to No. In the event it was 55-45. In short, the vote was closer than expected and that was down to a massive grass roots campaign by the Yes movement that led to a huge turnout. For 18 months Yes Scotland had been talking to people about the issues and the idea of independence. They had become politicised by the process. The mainstream media had pumped out the message that Yes was going to lose. Instead of falling for that, the campaign had its own agenda, which led to huge crowds turning up at rallies across the country. On the day of the vote, Yes staged an event in George Square, Glasgow, at which 50,000 people turned up. This was followed by a victory celebration for Yes which was attended by 20,000 people. The key to the success of the Yes campaign was that it was not run by politicians but by activists from the grass roots. Because Yes was a movement, not a party, it was able to bring people together from across the political spectrum to campaign for independence. It was a bit like the Occupy movement. The Left was split on whether to support independence. Some saw it as a chance to break up the British state. Others saw it as a diversion from the class struggle. In the end, the vast majority of the Left voted Yes. The Yes campaign made use of social media and the internet to good effect. That was how they got their message across. The No campaign was a shambles. Its slogan was 'Better Together' but its campaign was not exactly a success. It was run by Blairite Labour politicians and the Blairite Prime Minister, David Cameron, who was also involved. The turnout was a massive 84.6 of eligible voters. The No campaign consisted of an endless stream of threats about what would happen if we voted Yes: \"Scotland would leave the EU,\" \"Scotland would no longer be part of NATO,\" \"Scotland would not be able to use the pound,\" \"Scotland would not be able to afford benefits like the pension,\" \"Scotland would have to renegotiate its share of the National Debt,\" etc. There was even a threat that if we voted Yes, the whole of the UK would be dragged into a war against Russia by a Yes vote. We were threatened with a triple-dip recession, a currency crisis, and rising mortgage rates. All of which turned out to be complete rubbish. In the end, the No campaign was a total disaster and a triumph for Yes. After the No vote, the SNP leader Alex Salmond resigned. But this was not a defeat. He had won the battle of ideas. His replacement is Nicola Sturgeon, who is a lot more radical than Salmond. The vote was a stunning victory for the Left. The SNP has moved further to the Left and is now a Left nationalist party. The Scottish Labour Party is now in crisis. Many of its members and supporters had voted Yes. The party is now in turmoil. After the vote, Cameron promised Scotland a lot of things, which he has no intention of delivering. But he is now in a weak position and will have to do a deal. The vote had been preceded by an unprecedented mobilisation of Scottish workers. In 1820 the workers of Scotland united with their English comrades and sent a message to the government that they would not tolerate the Combination Act. This Act had made trade unions illegal. The workers had fought a long battle against it and the Act was repealed in", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "The result of the Scottish independence referendum was a historic moment for Scotland and the UK as a whole, writes the BBC's political correspondent, Tom Marshall-Bailey."}

However, economists had forecast a 2.1 rise in November and a 5.6 rise on an annual basis, according to a poll by Bloomberg. House prices in the year to November rose by 4.3, up from 4.1 the previous month and the fastest annual growth since 2010. But in London, house price growth slowed to 3.1, down from 4.6 the previous month. UK consumer price inflation slowed to 2.1 in December, down from 2.3 the previous month, according to the ONS. This is the first time the annual rate has fallen since September 2017. Economists had expected inflation to be 2.2. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \"The CPI inflation rate has now been pretty stable over the past year at 2.1 to 2.7. However, it is too early to say that inflation has peaked.\" Inflationary pressures will remain limited for the foreseeable future as the effect of the pound's post-referendum weakness has washed out of the annual comparison, he added. The retail prices index (RPI) inflation rate was 3.2 in December, down from 3.4 in November. The core inflation rate, which excludes the more volatile components of food and energy, fell to 2.1 in December from 2.3 the previous month.

The accounting deficit fell from 70bn at the end of November to 47bn at the end of December. The investment-return-based deficit increased from 2bn at the end of November to 8bn at the end of December.

Aberdeen Standard Investments warns of 'punishing' year ahead Aberdeen Standard Investments has warned that the coming year could be \"punishing\" for investors as the threat of a trade war between the US and China continues to loom. In its 2019 global investment outlook, ASI has said that investors should \"brace themselves for a potentially punishing year\" in 2019. The report says: \"We see downside risk to the global economy and believe that the balance of risks is skewed to the downside. Economic growth in developed markets looks to be at or near its peak. The momentum is likely to slow in 2019.\" Investors should be aware that \"things may not always be as they seem,\" the report adds. It says: \"We expect an eventful 2019. Even if the economy and markets continue to grow and remain relatively stable, the mood may not. Investors should be aware that things may not always be as they seem. \"For example, while current US growth is strong, the stimulus that has driven it is waning and the US is still running a large budget deficit. Similarly, while corporate earnings growth has been good in recent quarters, this is likely to come off the boil next year as profit margins come under pressure.\" The report says: \"We believe the most important questions for investors are how long the good times will last and what might threaten them. Central to this is the current robust US growth and the resilience of its economy. We expect that 2019 will see the economy lose some momentum, but not stall.

Bury had equalised through Neil Danns, but strikes from Joe Pigott, Kwesi Appiah and Giorgio Rasulo put the visitors 3-1 up at half-time. On the hour mark, Ben Reeves made it 4-1, before Appiah completed his hat-trick with 15 minutes left. The final whistle brought a raucous reaction from the 731 travelling supporters, and a miserable end to a miserable year for Bury. The home side were poor throughout, although they did have chances to at least make the scoreline a little more respectable. But they had to endure the sights of Rasulo curling in a stunning free-kick from 20 yards and Danns firing over from close range in the dying moments.

It received the money despite warnings about the charity's management and safeguarding. The report also said that a further PS100m was given by the department to the Skills Funding Agency to fund a new programme set up to replace Learndirect, even though it was known to have \"serious weaknesses.\" Learndirect - which was rated \"inadequate\" by Ofsted in July 2016 - was investigated by BBC Radio 4's File on Four, which found that it had failed to address a range of weaknesses. In January, Ofsted found that almost one-in-five apprentices failed to complete their training on time, and a third of apprenticeship programmes were not up to scratch. In the wake of the news, the DfE's permanent secretary, Jonathan Slater, announced his resignation. Skills minister Anne Milton said: \"I was appalled by the performance of Learndirect. \"It's no good having poor quality apprenticeships and I won't accept that, which is why we are putting in place a robust system of oversight, to monitor quality and intervene where necessary.\" The NAO said that in February 2016, the Skills Funding Agency, which was responsible for monitoring Learndirect, produced a report outlining concerns about Learndirect's ability to deliver. It said Learndirect had a \"weak financial position,\" an \"overly complex\" group structure and \"significant concerns\" had been raised over its management. The NAO said the Skills Funding Agency's risk register for Learndirect, produced in January 2018, noted that it was a \"high risk and high impact\" provider and had an \"increased risk of closure.\" The NAO said the agency continued to award Learndirect contracts worth PS200m, even though \"it had serious concerns over the quality of apprenticeships being delivered, and the financial viability of the provider.\" The report added: \"Although the Skills Funding Agency concluded that Learndirect was a going concern, it did not consider the specific implications of Learndirect failing - for example, on the delivery of apprenticeships - and there was no formal agreement on how these might be mitigated.\" The NAO said that in August 2018, when Learndirect failed to hit its targets, the Education and Skills Funding Agency terminated the provider's contracts for funding adult education courses and removed its eligibility for further funding. \"By this point, Learndirect had received 28m of public money in 2017-18 for the adult education courses,\" the NAO said. It said that in the wake of the collapse, the Skills Funding Agency had identified 1,200 apprentices at risk of losing their qualification. The agency told the NAO that 920 of these apprentices were now on other programmes. The NAO said that Learndirect's closure left 750 apprentices without training and with no guaranteed way to complete their apprenticeships. It also said that the Education and Skills Funding Agency's contracts with Learndirect had been inadequately managed. It said: \"Learndirect's contract with the agency for funding apprenticeships had been awarded in 2016 without due diligence. \"It also lacked transparency, with no breakdown of the 45m price and no requirement to demonstrate that Learndirect could meet the funding conditions.\" Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said: \"The Learndirect story has been characterised by failure to tackle problems swiftly when they arose. \"The Department for Education should have taken action to stop funding Learndirect sooner. \"Had the department acted decisively, Learndirect would have had less money to spend and the risks to the apprenticeships programme could have been reduced. \"The department should have assessed the impact of Learndirect's failure on its apprenticeship programme, and take steps to reduce the impact on its staff and the company's other customers.\" The NAO said that in July 2018, the Department for Education awarded a contract worth 109m to Learndirect to run a new apprenticeships programme, despite concerns raised by", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Learndirect received millions of pounds in government funding despite warnings about its management and safeguarding, a report has found.

Jarrar told The Associated Press that he received a call from the show's producers, asking him to come to the set, in the Al-Am'ari refugee camp, because they needed graffiti. \"I was angry. I told them: 'You know nothing about my culture, my country, my people, yet you want me to write about them on the walls,\" he said. He and the other artists went to the set on Sunday, carrying cans of spray paint. Jarrar said they told the producer that they would write what they wanted. \"So we wrote: 'Homeland is racist' and 'Homeland is a joke, and it didn't come out right',\" he said. He said the producer was angry and cursed at them, but did not ask them to leave or to change the graffiti. The artists said that some of the graffiti they wrote was blocked from view by props. In the episode, an actor walks by a section of wall with graffiti that reads: \"Homeland is not a series.\" The artists said they were asked to write the graffiti in English, so that the English words would be translated into Arabic for the TV show. The show has been widely criticized for its portrayal of Arabs and the Middle East. The show's audience in the Arab world has grown in recent years, thanks to the Internet and illegal copies. While many viewers enjoy the show, they also mock it. Jarrar said he would like to meet \"Homeland\" star Claire Danes, whom he called a \"nice actress.\""}

{"original_text": "Philae, the first spacecraft to land on a comet, was dropped on to the surface of Comet 67P by its mothership, Rosetta, last November. It worked for 60 hours before its solar-powered battery ran flat. The comet has since moved nearer to the Sun and Philae has enough power to work again, says the BBC's science correspondent Jonathan Amos. An account linked to the probe tweeted the message, \"Hello Earth! Can you hear me?\" On its blog, Esa said Philae had contacted Earth, via Rosetta, for 85 seconds on Saturday in the first contact since going into hibernation in November. \"Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35C and has 24 watts available,\" said Philae project manager, Dr Stephan Ulamec. Scientists say they now waiting for the next contact. Esa's senior scientific advisor, Prof Mark McCaughrean, told the BBC: \"It's been a long seven months, and to be quite honest we weren't sure it would happen - there are a lot of very happy people around Europe at the moment.\" Philae was carrying large amounts of data that scientists hoped to download once it made contact again, he said. \"I think we're optimistic now that it's awake that we'll have several months of scientific data to pore over,\" he added. This is one of the most astonishing moments in space exploration and the grins on the faces of the scientists and engineers are totally justified, says BBC science editor David Shukman. For the first time, we will have a hitchhiker riding on a comet and describing what happens to a comet as it heats up on its journey through space, he adds. Philae is designed to analyse the ice and rocky fragments that make up the comet. Prof Monica Grady from the Open University told the BBC that scientists now hoped to be able to carry out experiments to see whether comets were the source of life on Earth. Comets contained a lot of water and carbon, and \"these are the same sorts of molecules responsible for getting life going,\" she said. \"What we're trying to find out is whether the building blocks of life, in terms of water and carbon-bearing molecules, were actually delivered to Earth from comets.\" When Philae first sent back images of its landing location, researchers could see it was in a dark ditch. The Sun was obscured by a high wall, limiting the amount of light that could reach the robot's solar panels. Scientists knew they only had a limited amount of time - about 60 hours - to gather data before the robot's battery ran flat. But the calculations also indicated that Philae's mission might not be over for good when the juice did eventually run dry. The comet is currently moving in towards the Sun, and the intensity of light falling on Philae, engineers suggested, could be sufficient in time to re-boot the machine. And so it has proved. Scientists must now hope they can get enough power into Philae to carry out a full range of experiments. One ambition not fulfilled before the robot went to sleep was to try to drill into the comet, to examine its chemical make-up. One attempt was made last year, and it failed. A second attempt will now become a priority. Return of the plucky robot Philae's extraordinary opportunity Rosetta: The whole story The Rosetta probe took 10 years to reach 67P, and the lander - about the size of a washing-machine - bounced at least a kilometre when it touched down. Before it lost power, Philae sent back images of its surroundings that showed it was in a dark location with high walls blocking sunlight from reaching its solar panels. Its exact location on the duck-shaped comet has since been a mystery. Esa had a good idea of where it was likely to be, down to a few tens of metres, but could not get Rosetta close enough to the comet to acquire conclusive pictures. Continued radio contact should now allow precise coordinates to be determined, correspondents say. Comet 67P is currently 205 million km (127 million miles) from the Sun, and getting closer. It is due in August to get as close as 186 million km, before then sweeping back out into the outer Solar System. As it nears the sun, the comet will warm and its ices will melt.

{"original_text": "The public car park is just off the Upper Newtownards Road, one of the main routes into the city. Thousands of wooden pallets are now piled up where previously there were none. In some places they rise nearly to the height of a house. A large sign on the fence reads: \"Warning: thieves operating in this area.\" This is just one example of a recurring problem in Belfast: illegal dumping. Every year, hundreds of tonnes of rubbish are dumped in the city, either in open spaces or in black bags left in back lanes. The person responsible is usually looking to make a few quid by providing a cheap rubbish removal service. They won't ask for identification or check that you are the legal owner of the waste they are being paid to dispose of. If it's illegal, they don't care. In Belfast, the problem is getting worse. The council's enforcement team received 1,200 reports of illegal dumping in 2015. This rose to 1,757 in 2016, an increase of 46. There were 1,440 reports in 2017, and the number is continuing to rise. The council's latest enforcement figures show that the problem is getting worse, with 872 reports of dumping in the first three months of 2018. While much of the rubbish is household waste, some is construction waste, including pallets and asbestos, which is particularly dangerous. Illegal dumping is a problem all over the city. In the ward of Castle, which covers the West of the city and the Lagan, there were 392 reports of dumping in 2017. In the Ardoyne area alone, there were 123. In the Botanic area, which includes Belfast's main university, Queen's, and the leafy suburbs of Stranmillis and Malone, there were 180. The worst-hit ward is East Belfast. In 2017, there were 712 reports of illegal dumping in the ward, which includes the Woodstock and Belmont areas. It is a problem that affects everyone. People who live in the areas where dumping is prevalent are often those who can least afford to live there. They are unable to move to somewhere nicer. Instead, they are forced to live with the problem. In a number of cases, the council has decided to take legal action. In 2017, 73 people were prosecuted for dumping rubbish. The average fine was 100, but in some cases the fines imposed have been much higher. The council is keen to stress that its enforcement policy is aimed not at the public but at those who operate as waste carriers. \"They have a duty of care to ensure they dispose of the waste they collect in a responsible manner,\" the council's waste enforcement manager, Donna McCartney, told The Detail. \"The council's environmental enforcement officers are currently investigating a number of waste operators following complaints received from members of the public about waste being dumped.\" The Detail contacted some of the companies that were prosecuted last year. Most refused to comment. However, two of the firms prosecuted were still operating, under different names. The issue of illegal dumping is not unique to Belfast. It's a problem in other parts of Northern Ireland and also in the Republic of Ireland, where a study commissioned by the Environmental Protection Agency found that 44 of waste was being illegally dumped. In Belfast, the problem is a complex one. The city has just three landfill sites, two of which are due to close within the next few years. The council is already looking for alternatives, including a possible new landfill site. Until that is found, the council is under pressure to recycle as much of the waste it collects as possible. As of April 2018, 45 of waste is recycled. The council has a target of 50 by the end of the year, and 55 by 2020. This puts pressure on waste management companies to provide a service for less money. The problem is also exacerbated by the fact that the council, like all other public bodies, is facing a funding crisis. In the current financial year, its budget has been cut by 70 million. This has led to the council cutting the frequency of bin", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "In the middle of a busy road in north Belfast, a large pile of rubbish has been dumped on the side of the road.

{"original_text": "Prof Allyson Pollock and colleagues at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous. They do not want an outright ban but say the sport must change and safeguards are needed. The Rugby Football Union said steps had been taken to make the sport safer. The RFU says the physical and social benefits that rugby offers to children \"massively outweigh any potential drawbacks\" and that myriad safety measures are already in place. These include the provision of a safe environment through investment in pitches and facilities, ensuring adequate first aid and medical facilities, and fully training coaches in methods to prevent injuries to young players. Ministers also want to see more children taking up sport. In 2012, then Culture Minister Jeremy Hunt announced a plan to link up thousands of schools with rugby clubs. But Prof Pollock fears there are not enough safety checks and measures to support this, meaning children could get hurt. She wants to see an increase in the recording of injuries and better injury prevention analysis. She claims that, compared with New Zealand, the UK has few strategies to protect players. Each season, children have about a one in 10 chance of getting injured badly enough that they need at least seven days off the pitch. Some injuries are minor, but others can cause permanent disability. Most rugby injuries occur during the tackle, as players collide at speed. But scrums are the most dangerous part of play, where some of the most serious injuries occur, Prof Pollock and colleagues say in their report in the British Medical Journal. Concussion and spinal trauma are the big concerns. Some injuries can prove fatal - as the Robinson family from County Antrim know only too well after their 14-year-old son, Ben, died having been hurt in a school rugby match in 2011. He collapsed at the end of that match after he was involved in a series of heavy tackles. An inquest heard that the teenager died from brain injuries. Prof Pollock says not enough is being done to put in place injury monitoring and prevention strategies - and little is known about what really works. \"Only by collecting injury data and by providing feedback to individuals and organisations working on safety initiatives will the short - and long-term impact of injury prevention programmes, whether for rugby or any other sport, be known,\" she said. She added some measures - such as matching child rugby players by size rather than age, playing only non-contact matches and having fewer players on the pitch at any one time - may help reduce the frequency of the most severe injuries. The RFU says set-phase play such as scrums and line-outs are introduced gradually, according to a child's rugby development, with scrums initially only containing three players per side and are uncontested. An RFU spokesman said: \"We take player safety extremely seriously, and this is at the core of all the training we deliver to coaches, referees and medics, at all levels of the game. \"Rugby for young people at schools or clubs in England exists in different forms, both contact and non-contact. \"Significant work has been undertaken over a number of years to develop new rules of play to ensure maximum possible safety, with a structured progression to cover the introduction, playing, teaching and refereeing of the game from under-seven to under-18.\" A government spokesman said: \"Player safety in schools and at all levels of sport is absolutely paramount and sports governing bodies and the government are completely committed to it. \"The rugby governing bodies work hard to ensure the sport in schools is played as safely as possible and that young people reap the benefits of participating - boosting their health, self-esteem and encouraging teamwork.\"", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "Prof Allyson Pollock and colleagues at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous.

{"original_text": "All examples of this group, known as the Archosauromorpha, lay eggs. This led some scientists to wonder whether there was something in their biology that prevented live births. But examination of the fossil remains of a very long-necked, 245 million-year-old marine reptile from China revealed it was carrying an embryo. Jun Liu, first author of the new study in Nature Communications, told BBC News that the animal would have measured between three and four metres long, with a neck that was about 1.7m long. The embryo may have been around half a metre long and is positioned inside the rib cage of the adult Dinocephalosaurus fossil, which was discovered in 2008 in Luoping County, Yunnan Province in southern China. Researchers had to consider whether the smaller animal might have been part of the adult's last meal. But it's facing forward, whereas swallowed prey generally face backwards because predators consume the animal head first to help it go down the throat. Another line of evidence in favour of the live birth idea is that the small reptile inside the mother is clearly an example of the same species. Co-author Prof Mike Benton, from the University of Bristol, told BBC News that the fossil was important because the Archosauromorpha form one of three large groupings of land-based vertebrates (backboned animals), each including about 10,000 species. Since we now know that no fundamental biological barrier to live births exists in this group, palaeontologists would be \"looking very closely\" at other fossils. He suggested one target would be a group of aquatic crocodile relatives - whose mode of reproduction was not well known.

This led some scientists to wonder whether there was something in their biology that prevented live births. But examination of the fossil remains of a very long-necked, 245 million-year-old marine reptile from China revealed it was carrying an embryo. Jun Liu, first author of the new study in Nature Communications, told BBC News that the animal would have measured between three and four metres long, with a neck that was about 1.7m long. The embryo may have been around half a metre long and is positioned inside the rib cage of the adult Dinocephalosaurus fossil, which was discovered in 2008 in Luoping County, Yunnan Province in southern China. Researchers had to consider whether the smaller animal might have been part of the adult's last meal. But it's facing forward, whereas swallowed prey generally face backwards because predators consume the animal head first to help it go down the throat. Another line of evidence in favour of the live birth idea is that the small reptile inside the mother is clearly an example of the same species. Co-author Prof Mike Benton, from the University of Bristol, told BBC News that the fossil was important because the Archosauromorpha form one of three large groupings of land-based vertebrates (backboned animals), each including about 10,000 species. Since we now know that no fundamental biological barrier to live births exists in this group, palaeontologists would be \"looking very closely\" at other fossils. He suggested one target would be a group of aquatic crocodile relatives - whose mode of reproduction was not well known.

And with the Scottish clubs expected to qualify for the group stages of the Champions League, the English top-flight clubs have some extra interest in the result. So, how will the outcome of the referendum affect English football? If Scotland votes 'Yes' to independence, the Scottish Football Association (SFA) has said that the 12 Scottish clubs in the top two divisions will not be allowed to play in the English football league system. Instead, they would move to a Scottish football league. It would also mean that Scotland would be unable to play as a united team in international competitions such as the World Cup. If Scotland votes 'No' to independence, the current arrangement with the Football Association (FA) in England will stay the same. Scottish teams would continue to play in the English league system and Scotland would be able to play as a united team in international competitions. The SFA's stance would require the clubs to break away from the Scottish league and set up their own competition. That would mean they would no longer play in the Scottish Premier League (SPL), which was formed in 1998 following the merger of the Scottish Football League and Scottish Premier Division. The SPL's membership would be cut from 12 to 10, as the bottom two clubs in the top tier - Dundee and Kilmarnock - are based in Scotland. The current set-up would remain in place. Scotland's top league would continue to be the SPL, and would continue to be played by the 12 teams currently playing in it. The big question is: would the Scottish teams be able to form a new league? In practice, this is unlikely.

The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) - which oversees the SPL and the lower leagues - has said that \"the overwhelming majority of clubs\" in Scotland would vote for the current set-up to continue.

The club's chief executive, Peter Lawwell, told the Herald that his preference would be to remain in the SPL. The Scottish government has said that a newly-independent Scotland would keep the Queen as head of state, so the clubs would still be able to enter the FA Cup. The FA Cup rules have no bar on foreign teams entering the competition, so the Scottish teams would still be able to compete. However, they would also have to enter the Scottish FA Cup, which was first played in 1873 and is the oldest football cup in the world. The Scottish FA has made it clear that it expects to keep Scotland's membership of Uefa, the European governing body for football.

{"original_text": "The research, by William C Campbell, Satoshi Omura and Youyou Tu, has led to drugs to treat diseases affecting more than 3.4 billion people around the world. One of them, ivermectin, is taken by more than 250 million people annually. The Nobel prize in physiology or medicine has been awarded to the researchers who discovered drugs that have treated more than 300 million people for devastating roundworm parasitic diseases. William C Campbell and Satoshi Omura were jointly awarded one half of the prize for their work on a drug called avermectin, which has radically lowered the incidence of river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, a painful and disfiguring disease. Youyou Tu was awarded the other half of the prize for her work in isolating artemisinin, a drug that has significantly reduced the mortality rates for patients suffering from malaria. The Nobel prize committee made the announcement at 11am BST (10am GMT) at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. The prize is worth 8m Swedish kronor (730,000) and will be presented at a ceremony on 10 December in Stockholm. Tu worked at the Academy of Chinese Traditional Medicine in Beijing, where she was the first to extract artemisinin from the plant Artemisia annua, a herb known as sweet wormwood. The extract is now used to treat millions of malaria patients every year. River blindness, also called onchocerciasis, is a parasitic disease that affects some 25 million people, mainly in Africa. It is caused by a filarial worm called Onchocerca volvulus, which is transmitted from person to person by blackflies. Symptoms of the disease include severe itching, disfiguring skin disease and blindness. Lymphatic filariasis, or elephantiasis, is a parasitic disease caused by infection with filarial worms. It is transmitted to humans through mosquitoes and can cause extreme swelling of the legs, arms, breasts and scrotum, which can lead to permanent disability and social stigma. Tu isolated artemisinin in the late 1960s and early 1970s, working in a laboratory where she had only the most basic equipment. She used traditional Chinese herbal medicine to find a treatment for malaria. \"When I heard that I'd won, I thought it was a mistake,\" Tu told the Guardian. She said her greatest satisfaction was seeing the impact her discovery had on patients. Omura discovered a new strain of Streptomyces bacteria in soil from a Japanese golf course and cultured it. In 1978, the bacteria yielded the powerful new agent avermectin, which proved to be effective against a wide range of parasitic diseases. The discovery led to the development of the drug ivermectin, which is taken by more than 250 million people every year. Avermectin has also been shown to have an impact on other parasitic diseases such as scabies. Campbell and Omura worked together to purify, study and develop derivatives of the new agent. Campbell made major contributions to the work by which Omura's strain of Streptomyces was cultured and the agent extracted. He also developed a method for purifying the compound. Campbell, born in Northern Ireland, shared the prize with Omura for discovering a new therapy against roundworm parasites.

He rose to fame by beating Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon but has been involved in a number of controversies, such as making remarks about Stan Wawrinka's girlfriend during a match last year, resulting in a suspended 28-day ban from the Association of Tour Professionals. \"He doesn't understand what it takes to be someone who wins Grand Slams at this level and that is unfortunate,\" McEnroe added. Kyrgios did not react to McEnroe's criticism, but asked if he felt he was applying himself the best he could, he replied: \"No.\" He added: \"When things get tough, I'm just a little bit soft. \"I've got experience, but it ultimately comes down to just laying it all out there and competing for a long time.

{"original_text": "The projection from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows a far-reaching shift in the balance of graduate numbers, with the rising Asian economies accelerating ahead of the West. Figures from the OECD show that the UK is still the second largest producer of graduates in the world, but has already fallen behind the United States, which has 1.4 million graduates per year compared to the UK's 1.2 million. According to the OECD, the number of UK graduates produced will be overtaken by China, which is predicted to have more than 1.5 million graduates a year by 2020, and by India, which is predicted to have produced 1.6 million. The OECD predicts the number of graduates produced in China will increase by 63 between 2010 and 2020, from 886,000 to 1.45 million, while the number of graduates produced in India will increase by 62, from 733,000 to 1.2 million. The rise of the Asian economies in the international graduate market, with China and India predicted to produce more than double the number of graduates as the US and the UK, is one of the trends identified by the OECD. But the OECD warns that such growth in graduates needs to be accompanied by an increase in the quality of education, as well as being followed by a rise in employment opportunities for graduates. Such a rise in graduate numbers in China and India is also leading to the emergence of a \"highly qualified global middle class\" in countries that traditionally have not produced many graduates. The rise of the Chinese and Indian middle classes, as well as the growing middle classes in Brazil, Mexico and South Africa, will lead to a \"massive rise in demand for higher education\" in these countries, the OECD predicts. But the OECD warns that such growth in the middle classes in developing countries will come \"at the expense of the middle classes in the advanced countries\" who will no longer be able to dominate the global economy. The OECD also predicts a rise in the number of students who study in a country other than their own. The number of students enrolled in higher education outside their own country increased from 2 million in 2000 to 3 million in 2008, and the OECD predicts that this figure could rise to more than 5 million by 2020.

{"original_text": "It is a question that has long seemed impossible to answer, since players from different decades can never face each other at their peaks. Add in an element of nostalgia to some fans, and the answer becomes even more clouded. But what if you could? What if you could pit two players from two different decades in a head to head battle? What if you could see, for example, Gareth Bale in his prime, against Cristiano Ronaldo in his? Or Wayne Rooney, fresh out of Everton against the current Premier League leading scorer Harry Kane? You can, thanks to a team of sports data analysts at Betfair, who have produced a series of infographics comparing players of the same position and age from two different decades. To do this, the team took a deep dive into 16,500 player profiles, with the aim of identifying the key indicators of player performance and the relationship between them. The findings showed that, when it comes to the top players, age is but a number. The data showed that players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Wayne Rooney peaked in their late twenties, while players such as Gareth Bale and Harry Kane hit their peak in their early twenties. The research also showed that, when it comes to the biggest names in the game, the age gap between the players of each decade is insignificant. In terms of international caps, 92 of the players analysed from played in at least 50 games, while 92 of the players from 2008-2017 played in at least 60. But when it comes to the infographics, the fun is in the details, and seeing the stark differences between the current best and the best of yesteryear. Here are some of the key differences. The current crop of the Premier League's best strikers are more potent, both in front of goal and in terms of the amount of assists they give. While Kane, Lukaku and Aguero all have better average goals per game than players from the previous decade, they also tend to pass the ball around more. The 2018 top scorers average an assist every 4 games, while the top scorers from 20 years ago average one every 6 games. Perhaps unsurprisingly, players from the current generation score more often, averaging a goal every 3 games, compared to a goal every 4 games for the players from the previous decade. In terms of passing, players from the current generation pass the ball around more, averaging 32.5 successful passes per game, compared to 28.2 for the previous generation. Perhaps the biggest difference is in terms of international caps. 48 of the current Premier League top scorers have been capped 40 times, compared to just 33 of the previous decade's top scorers. When it comes to tackles, the current crop of strikers are more frugal with their tackles, averaging 1 per game, compared to 1.5 per game for players from 20 years ago. When it comes to the midfield, players from the current generation have the edge when it comes to tackling, while the previous generation have the edge in terms of passing. The current generation of midfielders averages 1.4 tackles per game, compared to 1.1 for the previous decade. In terms of passing, the current generation of midfielders averages 59.5 passes per game, compared to 50 passes per game for the previous generation. When it comes to interceptions, the previous generation averages 1.5 per game, compared to the current generation's 1.3 per game. The current generation of midfielders average 1.2 goals per game, compared to 0.9 per game for the previous generation. When it comes to international caps, the current generation of midfielders is on par with the previous generation, with 27 of players from both decades capped 40 times. When it comes to the fullbacks, the current generation is more likely to score, averaging a goal every 11 games, compared to a goal every 14 games for the previous generation. The current generation is also more frugal with their tackles, averaging 1.7 per game, compared to 2 per game for the previous generation.

{"original_text": "Islamic tradition requires the dead to be buried as soon as possible, unless an autopsy is required. The US military took this requirement very seriously, burying the body within hours. \"Traditional procedures for Islamic burial were followed,\" an official said. Religious rites were carried out on the deck of a US aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson. The body, shrouded in a white sheet and placed in a weighted bag, was then positioned on a flat board, tipped up, and eased into the Arabian Sea. This occurred at 0600GMT, approximately 12 hours after the firefight during which Osama Bin Laden was shot in the head. After this first shot, reports ABC News' The Blotter, he was shot again, to make sure that he was dead. The body was then flown to Afghanistan and Bin Laden's identity was confirmed. Officials say a DNA sample was taken that matched that of several other family members. Some sources say facial recognition technology was also used. From Afghanistan, the body was, it appears, flown to the USS Carl Vinson. \"A military officer read prepared religious remarks, which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker,\" a US defence official said. According to UK-based Imam Dr Abduljalil Sajid, Chairman of the Muslim Council for Religious Racial Harmony, four key steps need to be followed: There is no necessity for an imam to be present, he says, but the procedures should be carried out by Muslims at least one of whom \"knows the minimum basic Muslim law of burial.\" Whether any such person was present is impossible to know, he says, based on the limited information provided. But he also questions whether sea burial was appropriate in this case. It is correct to carry out a burial at sea when someone dies on a sea journey, he says, but in this case there was no sound reason for it. The US authorities could surely have found someone - a member of the extensive Bin Laden family, or even one of the many supporters of his \"evil\" ideology - who would have been prepared to give the body a proper burial, he argues. His words were echoed by Mohammed Qudah, a professor of Islamic law at the University of Jordan, who told the Associated Press news agency that burying Bin Laden at sea was not forbidden if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial. But he went on: \"It's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive Bin Laden's body.\" The agency also quoted Dubai's grand mufti Mohammed al-Qubaisi, saying that sea burials were permissible only in extraordinary circumstances, adding: \"This is not one of them.\" \"If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: You dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it,\" he said.

Second, that there was no time to negotiate with other countries to arrange a possible burial on land. According to CBS News, Saudi Arabia refused to take the body.

Blackberry was widely praised for its security, but its new phones have been hit by poor reviews. The Priv received mixed reviews - including criticism for its poor battery life and lack of apps. Blackberry has had to rethink its strategy in recent years. Blackberry's DTEK50 phone can warn users when apps are accessing personal data When it launched in 2013, it aimed to attract more mainstream users with its BB10 software, but the company quickly changed course.

The list includes the names of the 7,000 SS guards who served at Auschwitz between 1940 and 1945. In addition to the names, the list also shows each SS man's rank, date of birth, date of arrival at the camp, and date of departure, as well as information on awards, transfers, and promotions. The list was compiled by the SS in 1947, one year after the camp was liberated by the Red Army, as a result of an order from the US occupation forces in Germany. However, the list was made public only in 2005 when an author and historian, Pawel Skibinski, discovered it in an archive in the town of Ludwigsburg, in Germany. The names of the SS men who served at the camp are listed on the museum's website, , with information on their careers after the war.

{"original_text": "Liberal centrist Emmanuel Macron - winner of the first round - and nationalist Marine Le Pen are already revolutionising French politics. They have delivered a big blow to the long-dominant Socialists and conservatives. Turnout at the election was the lowest in decades, and 12 million people did not cast votes. \"I want to be the president of patriots against the threat of nationalists,\" Mr Macron told supporters in Paris, adding he had a \"message for all Europeans.\" \"The challenge is to break completely with the system which has been in place for 30 years,\" he said. Mr Macron - who is pro-business, socially liberal and in favour of EU integration - said he would bring in new faces and talent. Ms Le Pen said her National Front (FN) party, previously a pariah in French politics, had changed the nation. \"The great issue in this election is the rampant globalisation, which in France harbours millions of unemployed and desperate people,\" she told supporters in Paris. She vowed to \"guarantee the safety of the French people and the nation.\" The presidential election, in which almost 47 million people were eligible to vote, is the first time neither of France's traditional main parties - the Socialists and conservative Republicans - made it to the second round. \"France is back! Bravo to the voters who put themselves in motion!\" conservative leader Francois Fillon, who had come third in Sunday's vote, told the French newspaper Le Figaro. Mr Macron, a former investment banker, is widely seen as a political novice. He served as economy minister in the outgoing Socialist government but has never run for election. His En Marche! (Onwards!) movement - founded just a year ago - has been described as a vehicle for his ambitions. He has campaigned on a slogan of \"En Marche!\" and pledged to shake up the French political system, re-energise its economy and reassert its place on the world stage. The 39-year-old casts himself as neither left nor right, and says he is happy to spurn the ideological divisions that have dominated French political thinking for decades. He has called for deep economic reforms, and expansionary fiscal policies in a bid to improve the French economy. Mr Macron has portrayed himself as a man of the future, while Ms Le Pen has depicted him as a \"candidate of the elite.\" Ms Le Pen, who has also never held elected office, presents herself as a champion of the people. Her policies include curbs on immigration, more law and order, lowering the retirement age and taking France out of the euro. She wants to hold a referendum on France's membership of the EU. Ms Le Pen wants to abandon the euro in favour of the franc and threatens to take France out of the EU altogether if Brussels does not back down on issues such as free movement. She is also an admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin and wants to forge closer ties with Moscow. The presidential election will be followed by a two-round parliamentary election in June. If Mr Macron wins, as the opinion polls predict, he will need to secure a majority in the legislature in order to be able to govern effectively. He will need a large number of seats to command a majority, which would not be an easy task for a president who is an independent. If Ms Le Pen wins, there is every chance that her party could fail to win a majority in the legislature, as the traditional parties are unlikely to join forces with her. In that scenario, she would find it difficult to govern. It is not the first time that France has seen a presidential candidate who has no party backing.

Ramos-Vinolas, who is at a career-high world ranking of 19, capitalised on a string of unforced Murray errors to take the first set but was pinned back in the second as the Scot battled back to level. In Monte Carlo, Murray had led 4-0 in the final set before capitulating to a defeat to Ramos-Vinolas. In Barcelona, it was the Spaniard who held a final set lead, winning the first two games before injuring his foot attempting to receive a volleyed return, which led to a lengthy period of treatment. The incident initially benefited Murray, who won the next three games, but Ramos-Vinolas steadied the ship and looked set for victory after breaking in the ninth game. However, Murray dug deep and immediately broke back before taking the match to a tie-break that he largely dominated and clinched on his second match point. \"It was obviously a very tough match,\" said Murray. \"It was kind of the opposite of the match we had last week where probably today he deserved to win. He created a lot more chances, he served for the match and couldn't quite get it. \"Last week I had 4-0 [in the third set], I felt like I had all of the chances.

Their intention was to leave Turkey and then head for Greece. They had been staying at a house in a town in Hatay province, reports said. Turkish police took the eight into custody and their two vehicles were seized. The Syrian military said on Friday that the city of Quneitra, in Syria's south-west province of the same name, had been retaken from rebels. The pro-government al-Watan newspaper said the military had \"raised the Syrian flag\" in the city, a short distance from the frontier with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The rebel fighters withdrew to the village of al-Burayqa, 1.5km (one mile) away, and the Syrian army is now advancing in that area, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Quneitra was captured by the rebels in 2014 and since then the UN says there have been at least 348 breaches of the ceasefire in the area, with 16 people killed and 147 injured. Separately, a car bomb attack on a rebel-held village near the northern city of Aleppo has killed at least 12 people, the observatory said. The attack in a market in Azaz, about 5km (three miles) from the Turkish border, is said to have injured at least 40 others. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the explosion but jihadists from the Islamic State group are not far from the area. The area was captured from IS by rebel fighters in February 2016. Earlier this month, a car bomb in Azaz killed at least 69 people and wounded 300. IS said it was behind that attack, although no group has claimed responsibility for Friday's blast. Syria's five-year civil war has killed more than 250,000 people and displaced more than 11 million others.

{"original_text": "It was a scrappy effort, which saved the game from going to what had seemed an inevitable penalty shootout. Stevie Mallan though had earlier missed the game's best chance for the visitors. Those in the stadium can't have been in any doubt of the importance of the game. The first ever final between the two clubs was always going to be of high interest. It's 19 years since both clubs were last in the Premier Division, that game being at Dens Park, and this was the first time both clubs had been in the top tier at the same time since 1987. In the end the game was played in front of a crowd of 20,631, which is more than most Championship games this season. That in itself is a testament to the interest in the game. As always it's a shame that the first chance of the game fell to the visitors. A defensive slip up presented Stevie Mallan with a sight of goal and he struck his shot well enough, but there wasn't enough power in it to beat Zdenek Zlamal. The game was open and both sides created chances but neither of the teams were able to capitalise on their chances. There was a bizarre moment in the first half when a Hibs player was struck on the head by a helium balloon. Hibs ended the half with the greater number of chances. There were a couple of half chances for the visitors at the start of the second half, but Hibernian dominated the second half. They had more possession and chances than their opponents, but their players failed to take the chances they created. The first change came midway through the second half when Scott Allan replaced Marc McNulty. Five minutes later the visitors made a change, Lewis Morgan replaced Scott Tanser. Both sides had chances to score, but neither goalkeeper was called into any real action. The game became a bit scrappy as both sides became desperate for a winner. With the game heading for a penalty shootout, referee Alan Muir awarded the home side a penalty. Scott Allan stepped up and drove the ball into the bottom right corner of the net.

{"original_text": "That is the eye-catching accusation in the Guardian, following a report in a trade publication, the Bookseller. Amazon will not confirm that it has managed to do this. The accusation is based on a very small number of sales, which, in the case of one of the books, was less than ten copies. According to the Guardian, the two books, one on crocheting and the other on World War II, had been published by a company called Toucan Books, which appears to be a vanity publisher. On being asked about its sales by its authors, Toucan Books told them that the books had been withdrawn by Amazon. The Bookseller reported that Amazon had been asked to make a statement about the withdrawal of the titles. 'We have no comment at this time,' said an Amazon spokeswoman. The Bookseller could not get any further comment from the vanity publisher. The withdrawal of the books by Amazon led to a flurry of angry tweets by authors who are published by Amazon, and who fear that they might also be the subject of similar censorship. The fact is that Amazon has the power to remove any book from sale from its website, without having to offer any explanation. The company is notorious for its secretive dealings. In May 2014, Amazon removed the ebook version of 1984 from the Kindle store. In that case, the reason was that the book had been published without the permission of the copyright owner, the estate of George Orwell. In April 2012, Amazon removed the book, Fifty Shades of Grey, from its site, as part of an attempt to crack down on pirate copies of the book. It subsequently reinstated it. In 2009, Amazon removed from sale two books by American political commentator, Glenn Beck, following protests by the publisher. At the time of the Orwell debacle, Amazon's vice president, Jay Carney, said in a statement: 'When we were notified of this by the rights holder, we removed the title from sale as soon as we could. This was an error on our part. We apologise for any confusion this caused. 'We are in discussions with the rights holder to resolve this matter and we look forward to being able to offer this book to our customers as soon as possible.' Perhaps the rights holder in the case of the crocheting book was the publisher, Toucan Books, who were contacted by the authors to enquire why their books had been withdrawn. Perhaps the publisher told Amazon, and the books were withdrawn. Perhaps the publisher was told by Amazon that the books were being withdrawn because of the use of images without permission. Perhaps the publisher then told the authors that the books were being withdrawn. Alternatively, the books may have been withdrawn for some other reason. As Amazon is a secretive organisation, it is difficult to know. The company's representatives are unwilling to make statements, and may not even know the real reason. The Guardian report quotes the International Publishers Association (IPA), which has expressed concerns about the way in which Amazon is able to withdraw books, without making a statement. 'The ability of Amazon to withdraw books from sale is an alarming development in the democratisation of publishing,' said the IPA's president, Richard Charkin. 'There is an immediate need for the company to clarify its position and to be transparent about its actions. The IPA believes there are fundamental issues at stake here about the value of copyright, the function of publishers, and the health of the book industry.' The IPA has called on Amazon to clarify its position, as a matter of urgency, and to make its position more transparent. 'We call on Amazon to be more transparent in its dealings with publishers and authors,' said Charkin. 'We would like to know what rules Amazon applies in order to decide when it can remove books from sale. We would like to know what recourse there is for publishers and authors who find their books removed.' The IPA is encouraging all publishers and authors to contact Amazon to express their concern. As it is now a month since the Bookseller report was first published, perhaps Amazon will issue some sort of statement in the near future.

The withdrawal of the books by Amazon led to a flurry of angry tweets by authors who are published by Amazon, and who fear that they might also be the subject of similar censorship. The fact is that Amazon has the power to remove any book from sale from its website, without having to offer any explanation. The company is notorious for its secretive dealings. In May 2014, Amazon removed the ebook version of 1984 from the Kindle store. In that case, the reason was that the book had been published without the permission of the copyright owner, the estate of George Orwell. In April 2012, Amazon removed the book, Fifty Shades of Grey, from its site, as part of an attempt to crack down on pirate copies of the book. It subsequently reinstated it. In 2009, Amazon removed from sale two books by American political commentator, Glenn Beck, following protests by the publisher. At the time of the Orwell debacle, Amazon's vice president, Jay Carney, said in a statement: 'When we were notified of this by the rights holder, we removed the title from sale as soon as we could. This was an error on our part. We apologise for any confusion this caused. 'We are in discussions with the rights holder to resolve this matter and we look forward to being able to offer this book to our customers as soon as possible.' Perhaps the rights holder in the case of the crocheting book was the publisher, Toucan Books, who were contacted by the authors to enquire why their books had been withdrawn. Perhaps the publisher told Amazon, and the books were withdrawn. Perhaps the publisher was told by Amazon that the books were being withdrawn because of the use of images without permission. Perhaps the publisher then told the authors that the books were being withdrawn. Alternatively, the books may have been withdrawn for some other reason. As Amazon is a secretive organisation, it is difficult to know. The company's representatives are unwilling to make statements, and may not even know the real reason. The Guardian report quotes the International Publishers Association (IPA), which has expressed concerns about the way in which Amazon is able to withdraw books, without making a statement. 'The ability of Amazon to withdraw books from sale is an alarming development in the democratisation of publishing,' said the IPA's president, Richard Charkin. 'There is an immediate need for the company to clarify its position and to be transparent about its actions. The IPA believes there are fundamental issues at stake here about the value of copyright, the function of publishers, and the health of the book industry.' The IPA has called on Amazon to clarify its position, as a matter of urgency, and to make its position more transparent. 'We call on Amazon to be more transparent in its dealings with publishers and authors,' said Charkin. 'We would like to know what rules Amazon applies in order to decide when it can remove books from sale. We would like to know what recourse there is for publishers and authors who find their books removed.' The IPA is encouraging all publishers and authors to contact Amazon to express their concern. As it is now a month since the Bookseller report was first published, perhaps Amazon will issue some sort of statement in the near future.

Ms Stang, 73, campaigned for 30 years to save the rainforest and protect the rights of the rural poor. The Brazilian nun was shot in the back and neck after confronting a local rancher over his plans to illegally fell trees in the Amazon rainforest. Bastos, a small farmer and occasional labourer, is accused of pulling the trigger and, if found guilty, could face a maximum 30-year prison sentence. The trial was due to begin last week but was postponed until 10 August after a delay in the arrival of one of the court's three judges. The case has already been delayed twice by appeals from the defence. \"The third trial is a little difficult, but we're hoping that justice will be served,\" said the nun's brother, David Stang. He said the defence had so far been able to stall the case with legal appeals, but he was hopeful that the third trial would not be interrupted. \"Our family and the Dorothy Stang Network are hoping the trial will be completed without more delays. \"We are hoping to see justice done and for the other defendants to be tried in the case as well,\" he said.

She was a member of the Pastoral Land Commission, which links the Catholic Church with the rural poor. It says 1,150 rural activists, including 160 Catholic priests, have been murdered in Brazil over the past 20 years. In 2007, a court acquitted the two men accused of ordering her killing but later convicted two others, including a rancher, in connection with the crime. The rancher's conviction was overturned on appeal, while the other man remains in prison.

{"original_text": "Ward, the world number 111, recovered from two sets down to win 6-7 (5-7) 5-7 6-3 7-6 (7-3) 15-13 in Glasgow. The Englishman needed six match points before finally seeing off the world number 20 after almost five hours. Andy Murray, playing his first match in Scotland for four years, had earlier beaten Donald Young 6-1 6-1 4-6 6-2. Media playback is not supported on this device The best-of-five tie continues with Saturday's doubles, before the reverse singles on Sunday. \"It's really tough for the USA now at two matches down,\" said GB captain Leon Smith. \"But they have Jim Courier as captain and he will not let them go down without a fight.\" There is now every prospect of Britain repeating last year's win over the US at the same stage, after Ward again produced an upset in the second singles match. Last year it was Sam Querrey in four sets - this time the Londoner came through a 111-minute final set to see off Isner and claim the win of his life. And if Murray had been expected to dominate proceedings on his return home, the opening day ended with Ward acclaimed by the 7,700 spectators at the Emirates Arena. \"This is by far the best atmosphere I've ever been involved in and thank you very much to all the crowd,\" said Ward. \"It was difficult. I had a lot of chances in the last set. It was an unbelievable match.\" A downcast Isner admitted: \"It's brutal. I'm barely going to sleep tonight, it's awful. \"I'm healthy. Mentally I'm certainly a bit shaken right now but I've got to be a professional and bring my best on Sunday. I don't feel too chipper right now but I'll let it rip on Sunday if that match is live.\" Isner looked in control after taking the opening tie-break and breaking serve for the first time in the match on his way to a two-set lead. Ward has been in the best form of his career over the last 12 months, however, and backed up by a gruelling off-season training block with Murray, he dug in and worked his way back into the contest. Two terrific passes helped him finally break the Isner serve in the third set and the Briton levelled in a tie-break as the momentum swung steadily in his favour. Ward dominated the decider, earning a break point and then five match points, only for the 6ft 10in Isner to keep him at bay with his huge serve. With no tie-break in the deciding set, the games ticked by, prompting memories of Isner's 11-hour marathon against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon 2010. Ward had his own moment of danger at 11-11 but saved two break points, the second in a long and desperately tense rally, but for the most part he looked the more likely winner. Media playback is not supported on this device It took until the 28th game of a gripping final set but there was no escape when Isner slipped 0-40 down, and he netted a volley to spark wild celebrations among the British squad. Ward shared a long hug with Murray, who had been dispensing advice via Smith from the sidelines throughout.

The Englishman needed six match points before finally seeing off the world number 20 after almost five hours.

Last year it was Sam Querrey in four sets - this time the Londoner came through a 111-minute final set to see off Isner and claim the win of his life. And if Murray had been expected to dominate proceedings on his return home, the opening day ended with Ward acclaimed by the 7,700 spectators at the Emirates Arena. \"This is by far the best atmosphere I've ever been involved in and thank you very much to all the crowd,\" said Ward. \"It was difficult. I had a lot of chances in the last set. It was an unbelievable match.\" A downcast Isner admitted: \"It's brutal. I'm barely going to sleep tonight, it's awful. \"I'm healthy. Mentally I'm certainly a bit shaken right now but I've got to be a professional and bring my best on Sunday. I don't feel too chipper right now but I'll let it rip on Sunday if that match is live.\" Isner looked in control after taking the opening tie-break and breaking serve for the first time in the match on his way to a two-set lead. Ward has been in the best form of his career over the last 12 months, however, and backed up by a gruelling off-season training block with Murray, he dug in and worked his way back into the contest. Two terrific passes helped him finally break the Isner serve in the third set and the Briton levelled in a tie-break as the momentum swung steadily in his favour. Ward dominated the decider, earning a break point and then five match points, only for the 6ft 10in Isner to keep him at bay with his huge serve. With no tie-break in the deciding set, the games ticked by, prompting memories of Isner's 11-hour marathon against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon 2010. Ward had his own moment of danger at 11-11 but saved two break points, the second in a long and desperately tense rally, but for the most part he looked the more likely winner. Media playback is not supported on this device It took until the 28th game of a gripping final set but there was no escape when Isner slipped 0-40 down, and he netted a volley to spark wild celebrations among the British squad.

But Juve - who had 77 possession - broke through when Pjaca drove low into the net five minutes after coming on and Alves finished from six yards 80 seconds after his own introduction. The goals ensured Juve's fourth successive 2-0 win on the road in all competitions and their advantage now looks huge ahead of the return on 14 March.

But with the game in its final quarter, Pjaca benefited from a ricochet off Miguel Layun - who came on at left-back after Telles' dismissal - to slam his first goal since joining the club in July past Iker Casillas.

The licensing authority, Teignbridge Council, said it was investigating. The kennel said it was staffed by \"animal lovers who work tirelessly to care and rehabilitate the dogs.\" The RSPCA announced on Friday it had agreed with the Devon and Cornwall Police force's request to review the way in which dogs seized under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 were cared for in kennels. Whistleblowers have made a series of allegations about dogs being put in 3ft by 9ft cages and then, due to safety concerns, not exercised. These include Stella, who had been caged for nearly two years, and Vinnie, a Rottweiler who whistleblowers said had also not been exercised. The BBC has also been told that three puppies, brought in at 11-weeks old, were briefly walked before being denied exercise. Further claims have been made that stray dogs brought in by local councils were also denied exercise. Devon and Cornwall Police are understood to have used the kennels to place a number of seized dogs but said since 2012 they had only instructed staff not to exercise four of these. However, current and former members of staff have said as many as 20 dogs had'Do Not Enter' signs on their cages. Former kennel manager David Clark said in the three years he worked there he did not see those dogs exercised. A spokesman for the kennels said: \"The puppies were walked regularly, as part of their kennel enrichment activities. However, we carry out regular risk assessments, and for these particular dogs, as they came into maturity they started to show signs of aggression. \"We did have to stop the walks during the final few weeks of their stay with us. \"One member of staff was bitten and, of course, we do have to take into account the breed characteristics of their parents, both very dangerous dogs.\" The spokesman said the kennels had cared for many dogs over the years, and had \"an excellent working relationship with Devon and Cornwall Police.\" The spokesman said: \"We are animal lovers and work tirelessly to care and rehabilitate the dogs that come to us from the police, but unfortunately sometimes the risks are too great. \"We would of course welcome and fully support any investigation by the council or RSPCA.

The extra measures will place \"a huge burden\" on Parliament and government departments, the report claims. The Commons' Brexit committee has also warned that the government must step up preparations for the UK's withdrawal from the EU. The committee, chaired by former minister, Labour's Hilary Benn, warns that the UK is now at risk of leaving the EU with no deal on future relations and no transition period. In a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May, the committee warns that the risk of a \"chaotic\" Brexit was increasing. The government is facing pressure from Labour to publish the full legal advice it received from the Attorney General about the deal. It had previously only published a summary of the advice.

{"original_text": "Three years ago, Swedish software consultancy Crisp decided that the answer was no. The firm, which has about 40 staff, had already trialled various organisational structures, including the more common hierarchical model, and found it to be lacking in some key ways. \"We had a difficult time scaling the company with all the problems that arise from having a traditional management structure,\" says Andreas Ade, head of operations at Crisp. \"Traditional organisations have managers who make the final decisions for their teams. That means that the manager can't focus on their own work, and they also don't scale. Crisp's solution to these problems was to adopt a flat structure, where there are no managers and everyone is treated as equals, regardless of their role or experience. The company, based in the capital Stockholm, has no CEO, CFO or any other 'Clevel executives. In this model, everyone is responsible for their own work and, when necessary, tasks are split between the team. The firm also has a governance structure, which is split into several sections, including people, business, engineering, sales and marketing. Each section has a board of directors, which is made up of all the people working in that section. The board of directors then has a meeting with the other boards once a month to discuss any problems or issues within the company. \"We use a flat organisational structure. There are no managers who are responsible for their teams,\" explains Ade. \"We try to be as flat as possible, which means we don't have any levels of hierarchy within the company. We also try to make sure that we're not just treating everyone the same, because that's impossible. But we try to be fair. As with all organisations, the structure is not perfect, and Ade concedes that the firm still has many issues to tackle. One of these is a potential lack of specialisation, which could be problematic in the long term, although it's not clear whether this is a result of the firm's structure or a more general trend towards ever-more generalist workers. \"People do multiple roles here and that's fantastic, but the problem is that it doesn't always result in expertise in the roles,\" he says. In addition, with no hierarchy, it can be difficult to ensure that everyone is clear on what they're expected to do. \"Another issue is making sure that we're clear on our expectations for each other. The business owner is responsible for setting the expectations, but they're also responsible for the business, so they don't always have the time,\" explains Ade. Despite this, the structure has delivered results so far. Crisp now has 40 staff, up from 20 in 2017, and its turnover is also on the up. The firm is also highly profitable, which Ade says is partly due to its structure. \"The structure has delivered results for us. We're a profitable company, and we're growing every year,\" he says. \"We're also seeing that people are staying here longer. I think it's because we're not treating people like resources, we're treating people like people. As well as delivering success within Crisp, the company also wants to show that the model works, in the hope that others might follow suit. To do this, the firm is open about its structure, and has published a book about it. \"Our goal is to show that there are other ways of running an organisation,\" says Ade. \"We hope that we can inspire others to change their organisational structure and to do things differently. \"We're doing that by being open about what we're doing and why we're doing it. We want to show that the way we're doing things is not by chance, it's by design. One of the biggest benefits of a flat organisational structure is that it can help to create a more inclusive workplace culture. For instance, because everyone is equal, it can help to break down the barriers that can arise in a hierarchical structure, where some people might be able to get away with bad behaviour because they have a higher status. \"Everyone is treated as an equal.

{"original_text": "Even with the usual caveats attached to opinion polls, a 65 to 17 majority for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK suggests little room for doubt. The British and Irish governments have both made it clear they don't think now is the time to hold a border poll. Sinn Fein are campaigning for a poll and the DUP have discussed, in their words, calling Sinn Fein's bluff. But after weeks of controversy about flags and national identity, politicians' claims about Catholic unionism, and a census showing a growing number identifying themselves as Northern Irish, what lies behind that headline figure in the Spotlight opinion poll is particularly revealing. Not surprisingly, more than 90 of those who identify themselves as Protestants told the pollsters they wanted to stay in the UK. But on the other side of the religious divide, a substantial 38 of Catholics also favoured remaining within the UK - three percentage points more than the number who backed a united Ireland. While only 5 of Protestants don't intend to vote or haven't decided which option they would pick, more than a quarter of Catholics are either undecided or not planning on voting. As avowed believers in a united Ireland and the party running a border poll campaign, Sinn Fein might be surprised to learn that nearly a quarter of those who identified themselves as Sinn Fein voters - 23 - told the pollsters they would back the status quo in a border poll. More than half of SDLP supporters - 56 - also said they would opt to stay in the UK if a poll was held tomorrow. Prime Minister David Cameron said the survey for the BBC Spotlight programme on the potential outcome of a border poll should lift the spirits of all those who value Northern Ireland's place within the union. The results of the 2011 census, released in December last year, revealed that just over a fifth of the population considers itself \"Northern Irish.\" That posed a political puzzle - in a border poll would these people tick a British or an Irish box? Well, those who identified themselves as \"Northern Irish\" for the BBC Spotlight poll back staying in the UK by a significant margin - 72 to just 7. At the DUP conference late last year Peter Robinson hinted that his party hopes to make inroads into Catholic unionist territory. Since then commentators have expressed the view that the union flag dispute and the ensuing protests make this a pipe dream. The Spotlight survey suggests the main parties have a long way to go to reach across the religious divide. Those identifying themselves as DUP supporters are 97 Protestant, while UUP supporters are 99 Protestant. Those backing Sinn Fein are 99 Catholic, while SDLP supporters are 92 Catholic. Alliance, as an identifiably centre ground party, is the one bucking the trend - with 51 Protestant backing and 36 Catholic support. Alliance's support for a \"designated days\" flag flying policy at Belfast City Hall stirred controversy and led to attacks on the party's offices and a death threat against its only MP, Naomi Long. However the Spotlight poll suggests raising the flag on 18 designated days is the most popular compromise across the community as a whole. Of those interviewed, 44 backed the designated days policy, in comparison to 35 wanting the union flag raised throughout the year. A further 10 told the pollsters no flag should be flown at the City Hall, while only 2 opted for the union flag flying alongside the Irish tricolour. Although designated days was the most popular option, flag flying polarises unionists and nationalists. 73 of unionists want the union flag up at Belfast City Hall 365 days a year, while 64 of nationalists support the 18 day policy. Even though the designated days compromise got more support than any other option, just over half of those interviewed thought the union flag protestors were right to take to the streets when Belfast City Council made its decision in early December. This result may reflect some people's belief in the right to protest, even if they don't back the aim of a particular demonstration. However this support appears to have dwindled sharply during the course of January, as by the time the Spotlight survey was carried out more than three quarters of interviewees wanted the protests to stop. They told the pollsters this was for a variety of reasons, the main ones being the violence sparked by some protests and the disruptive impact on business. Although the Stormont politicians might take heart from this shift of opinion, the protest organisers will point to the fact that by late January 45 of unionists still believed the demonstrations should continue. This shows a degree of resilience given the barrage of negative publicity generated by the protests.

{"original_text": "A health tribunal has found Peter Sutcliffe no longer needs any treatment for any mental disorder. In 1981 he was convicted of 13 murders and seven attempted murders and given 13 life sentences. The BBC reports that the 70 year old Sutcliffe, known as The Yorkshire Ripper, now spends most of his time in his cell reading and watching television. The NHS tribunal, held behind closed doors at Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital, ruled that he does not need further treatment for a mental disorder. Sutcliffe has been at the hospital for 35 years and has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. The tribunal ruled that he should remain in custody in hospital. The hospital has been criticised by watchdogs over the past 12 months. In December 2016 the health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) told Broadmoor that improvements had to be made or it risked losing its licence.

The court hearing was told that on 9 October, 2013, a car driven by Gavin Hughes was stopped in north Belfast, and when the vehicle was stopped a black plastic bag was located on the passenger seat. The bag contained five compact cubes of cocaine which amounted to 1.27 kilos of the Class A drug.

The following day, officers travelled to an address in the Ligoniel area of the city, which at the time was being rented by Gavin Hughes.

Both the property and a vehicle parked outside the house were searched, and further packages of cocaine were seized, alongside items and equipment associated with mixing drugs.

The total amount of cocaine seized on 9 and 10 October 2013 amounted to 3.25 kilos. The Hughes brothers subsequently pleaded guilty to a number of drugs offences, while Gerard Hughes also admitted two further offences - namely possession of cannabis with intent to supply, and possession of amphetamine on 6 August, 2013. These offences were linked to the seizure of drugs in a car park in east Belfast.

On Wednesday, Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family said in a statement that she had been taken to the hospital after suffering a panic attack. She was then moved to the psychiatric ward. \"Her husband, Richard, spoke to her on the phone and Zaghari said that she had passed out in her cell,\" the statement said. \"Her husband also told her that their daughter Gabriella had been sick.\" The UK Foreign Office said that it was aware of Zaghari-Ratcliffe's hospitalization, and was in contact with her family. \"We are extremely concerned about this and urgently seeking information from the Iranian authorities to establish what is going on,\" a spokesperson said. \"The Iranian authorities have a duty of care to all prisoners, and we expect them to fulfil this. It is clear that Iran's continued detention of Nazanin is a flagrant violation of international law and basic human rights.\" Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, told DW that his wife's health had been deteriorating over the past year. \"The Iranian authorities have told us that they are not responsible for her health, and if she has been ill, it is her responsibility,\" he said. \"The British government needs to be doing everything it can to secure Nazanin's release, so that she can get back to the UK and access the medical care she needs.\" Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested by Iranian authorities in 2016 and accused of spying, charges that she has denied. She was sentenced to five years in prison for allegedly plotting to topple the Iranian government. The Thomson Reuters Foundation, for which Zaghari-Ratcliffe works, has said that the charges against her are \"absurd.\" The Iranian judiciary has come under fire from rights groups for imprisoning thousands of political activists and journalists.

{"original_text": "\"The decision has dealt the final blow to democracy in the country,\" said the Organisation of American States. The court ruled that the assembly was in contempt and said it would be stripped of its power. The ruling sparked a wave of protests, with opposition supporters taking to the streets in their thousands. Opposition leaders have now vowed to pursue a campaign of street protests to force Mr Maduro to resign and call early elections. \"As long as there's no solution to this, the country's going to be paralysed,\" said opposition politician Julio Borges. \"We're going to take to the streets and build a permanent encampment so we can take control of the streets, because the government has to know that the country belongs to the people.\" The government said it was \"waiting for them with bullets,\" prompting protesters to accuse it of inciting a \"massacre.\" Political unrest has been mounting in Venezuela in recent years, with thousands of people taking to the streets on numerous occasions to protest against the government. More than 120 people were killed during clashes with security forces in 2014. The opposition accuses President Maduro of continuing the policies of his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, which they say have led to economic collapse, high inflation and food shortages. The president says that he is leading the country through an \"economic war\" being waged by right-wing businesses and foreign media. In March, the Supreme Court voted to take over powers from the assembly, a move that was reversed after an international outcry. But on Thursday the court ruled that the assembly was in contempt of court and said it would be stripped of its power. \"The National Assembly has committed very serious offences, which have undermined the constitutional order,\" the court said in its ruling. Critics of the court, including the opposition, have suggested that the judges have been influenced by the government. The government says the opposition is trying to mount a coup d'etat and has called on supporters to take to the streets in defence of the president. \"You want to come with your fascist violence to Venezuela, you want to come with a coup, we're waiting for you with our rifles, our rifles,\" Diosdado Cabello, a former National Assembly president, said on Thursday. In the capital, Caracas, thousands of government supporters gathered outside the Supreme Court in a show of support for the court and Mr Maduro. They say the opposition is trying to orchestrate a coup similar to those which have taken place in the country in the past. \"We're fed up with these coup-mongers,\" said government supporter Mildred Flores. \"We've had enough of them already.\"", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Venezuela's Supreme Court has voted to strip the opposition-controlled National Assembly of its powers, in a move condemned by the international community and the country's opposition."}

Yaya Toure struck a 20-yard free-kick against the bar before teenage substitute Kelechi Iheanacho levelled. But Spurs earned a fifth league win in a row as Eriksen slotted in. The Dane was played through on goal by substitute Erik Lamela to coolly finish, after Iheanacho had shot high into the net to restore parity. Arsenal's win over leaders Leicester earlier in the day temporarily moved the Gunners into second place but Spurs have gone back ahead of their north London rivals on goal difference. Analysis: Spirit, fitness and belief - why Spurs can win title Relive Tottenham's win at Manchester City Listen: Ramon Vega - \"I have no doubts Spurs will grab the league\" Media playback is not supported on this device Manuel Pellegrini's side won 21 points from their opening nine league games but have claimed just 26 points from their subsequent 17 matches. They are six points off the Premier League summit after losing two consecutive home league matches for the first time since December 2008, and have lost ground to Arsenal and Tottenham, who are in third and second respectively. City know the gap is not insurmountable, having been eight points behind Manchester United in April 2012 before snatching the Premier League title on the final day. But they are 11 points worse off than Leicester and Tottenham during this 17-game period and need to find form quickly. City will point towards the penalty as a key moment against a Tottenham side who have not won a top-flight title since 1961. Both sides struggled to create chances in a tight encounter but, despite Tottenham having more of the ball, the hosts will feel they deserved at least a point as David Silva scooped over late on. Media playback is not supported on this device Manchester City were absolutely furious at Mark Clattenburg's decision to penalise Sterling and you could understand why. The England forward had turned his back as he jumped to block Danny Rose's cross, with the ball hitting him as he was looking the other way. Former Wales and Leicester midfielder Robbie Savage told BBC Radio 5 live: \"I think that is harsh, very, very harsh. It has hit him on the elbow.\" However, in a match of few chances, City should ask questions defensively as they levelled before leaving themselves wide open seven minutes from time for Eriksen, on his 24th birthday, to win the match. England manager Roy Hodgson was at the Etihad and would have welcomed the earlier news of scoring returns for Arsenal's Danny Welbeck and Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge. In the first two games of the day, six of the nine goals scored had been netted by English players and his options before Euro 2016 were further demonstrated in Manchester as Kane scored his 16th Premier League goal of the season. The 11.9km covered by England's 19-year-old midfielder Dele Alli was more than all but one of Manchester City's side, as he continues to impress, while compatriot Eric Dier, 22, was solid in the holding midfield role. Another England forward, Sterling, was quiet for the most part for City, although he did almost break the deadlock with a volley that was bravely blocked by Rose early on. Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini told BBC Sport: \"It was a penalty that referee Mark Clattenburg wanted to sign for and he gave the sign. It was absolutely the wrong decision, it hit the back of Raheem Sterling then his elbow. Sterling was not even seeing the ball. It was the same referee in the first game where there were two clear goals in offside and we lost 4-1. \"It was the key moment that decided thee game; before that they did not shoot towards our goal and did not have any chances. We took the risks, the spirit of the team was good but it was not enough.\" Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino told BBC Sport: \"I think that it was a game that was very important. You could feel it was not a normal game and a real test for us; for that we feel very pleased for the players. \"The mentality was good and a perfect performance against a team with a lot of quality players who are top class.

Yaya Toure struck a 20-yard free-kick against the bar before teenage substitute Kelechi Iheanacho levelled. But Spurs earned a fifth league win in a row as Eriksen slotted in. The Dane was played through on goal by substitute Erik Lamela to coolly finish, after Iheanacho had shot high into the net to restore parity. Arsenal's win over leaders Leicester earlier in the day temporarily moved the Gunners into second place but Spurs have gone back ahead of their north London rivals on goal difference. Analysis: Spirit, fitness and belief - why Spurs can win title Relive Tottenham's win at Manchester City Listen: Ramon Vega - \"I have no doubts Spurs will grab the league\" Media playback is not supported on this device Manuel Pellegrini's side won 21 points from their opening nine league games but have claimed just 26 points from their subsequent 17 matches. They are six points off the Premier League summit after losing two consecutive home league matches for the first time since December 2008, and have lost ground to Arsenal and Tottenham, who are in third and second respectively. City know the gap is not insurmountable, having been eight points behind Manchester United in April 2012 before snatching the Premier League title on the final day. But they are 11 points worse off than Leicester and Tottenham during this 17-game period and need to find form quickly. City will point towards the penalty as a key moment against a Tottenham side who have not won a top-flight title since 1961. Both sides struggled to create chances in a tight encounter but, despite Tottenham having more of the ball, the hosts will feel they deserved at least a point as David Silva scooped over late on. Media playback is not supported on this device Manchester City were absolutely furious at Mark Clattenburg's decision to penalise Sterling and you could understand why. The England forward had turned his back as he jumped to block Danny Rose's cross, with the ball hitting him as he was looking the other way. Former Wales and Leicester midfielder Robbie Savage told BBC Radio 5 live: \"I think that is harsh, very, very harsh. It has hit him on the elbow.\" However, in a match of few chances, City should ask questions defensively as they levelled before leaving themselves wide open seven minutes from time for Eriksen, on his 24th birthday, to win the match. England manager Roy Hodgson was at the Etihad and would have welcomed the earlier news of scoring returns for Arsenal's Danny Welbeck and Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge. In the first two games of the day, six of the nine goals scored had been netted by English players and his options before Euro 2016 were further demonstrated in Manchester as Kane scored his 16th Premier League goal of the season. The 11.9km covered by England's 19-year-old midfielder Dele Alli was more than all but one of Manchester City's side, as he continues to impress, while compatriot Eric Dier, 22, was solid in the holding midfield role. Another England forward, Sterling, was quiet for the most part for City, although he did almost break the deadlock with a volley that was bravely blocked by Rose early on. Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini told BBC Sport: \"It was a penalty that referee Mark Clattenburg wanted to sign for and he gave the sign. It was absolutely the wrong decision, it hit the back of Raheem Sterling then his elbow. Sterling was not even seeing the ball. It was the same referee in the first game where there were two clear goals in offside and we lost 4-1. \"It was the key moment that decided thee game; before that they did not shoot towards our goal and did not have any chances. We took the risks, the spirit of the team was good but it was not enough.\" Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino told BBC Sport: \"I think that it was a game that was very important. You could feel it was not a normal game and a real test for us; for that we feel very pleased for the players. \"The mentality was good and a perfect performance against a team with a lot of quality players who are top class. Full credit to my players. \"From my point of view, I did not see the penalty incident.

{"original_text": "Conservative-run Bath and North East Somerset Council is holding a presentation of initial concept pictures of the redevelopment. Banes recently agreed it had to save PS2.6m from its PS351m budget, and the cost of the redevelopment is partly to blame. Banes' cabinet member for resources, Cllr David Dixon, said: 'We are in a very difficult financial position. We will need to make savings and these will impact on many people. 'We are sorry we cannot do more to help people whose homes will be demolished, but we have to be fair to all our residents and find the best way to balance the needs of the many against the needs of the few.' 'The final decision will be made in April 2010 and will be based on a thorough assessment of the impact on people who will be displaced by the demolitions and on the community as a whole.' The council is now considering three main options, which will be presented to the community in a drop-in session on 17 December. The options include demolition of three, six or nine blocks and the creation of new housing. Some residents have expressed concern about the council's preferred option of demolishing the blocks to create new social housing, because they feel the new units will be too small to accommodate them. But Cllr Dixon said: 'We are required to meet the housing needs of people on the housing waiting list. This means that we have to provide for families and single people. 'We recognise that people who live in three-bedroom properties have an emotional attachment to their homes and we will do what we can to help them find suitable new accommodation.' The council is also consulting with residents in Windsor Gardens, an estate next to the green. The council wants to refurbish the estate's 80 flats, but many residents say they do not want the flats improved because they feel the area is too dangerous. Cllr Dixon said: 'There is a real need for refurbishment to Windsor Gardens. The estate has many problems including leaking roofs, a poor layout and lack of space.'

{"original_text": "The former Huddersfield and Birmingham manager will need to hit the ground running at Rugby Park, with the team just one point above the relegation play-off place. And his old team-mate Alex Rae - the St Mirren manager - reckons the Killie board have chosen wisely. \"I think he will be a very good addition to Scottish football,\" Rae told BBC Scotland. \"I knew him from playing against him, and he became a team-mate in 1997 when he joined Sunderland. \"Lee has been around a long, long time now as a player and in the coaching and management side of things.\" Kilmarnock can certainly expect to see a manager who wears his heart on his sleeve. \"The one thing about Lee Clark is you definitely see his passion, you see him running up and down the touchline,\" added Rae. \"The board will be looking for a little bit of a bounce, they will be hoping they can continue the form from the last couple of games where they have drawn with Rangers and got a really good result at the weekend [a 2-0 victory at Motherwell].\" \"He will be going into a dressing room that will be a wee bit encouraged.\" The undoubted highlight of Clark's managerial story thus far was his first job. It ran from 2008 to 2012 following coaching spells at Newcastle United and Norwich City. For a while he was a huge prospect down south, famously taking League One Huddersfield on a 43-match unbeaten run. Backed by chairman Dean Hoyle, the remit for Clark was to take The Terriers into the Championship. Twice they made the play-offs. Twice they failed to go up. Eventually patience ran out and in February 2012 Clark was sacked following a 1-0 defeat to Sheffield United - a decision that looked harsh considering Clark had only lost three of his previous 55 league matches to that point. Hoyle wanted promotion and got it, with Clark's replacement, Simon Grayson, delivering via the play-offs. One of Clark's last signings for Huddersfield was Kallum Higginbotham - a player he will be reunited with at Kilmarnock. Clark would graduate to the Championship with Birmingham City but it was a time of turmoil at the club. Twice he preserved their status in the division, albeit survival in the 2013-14 season was secured by the tightest of margins - an injury-time goal from former Celtic player Paul Caddis keeping them up on goal difference. But a poor start to the following season saw Clark sacked in October 2014. His last managerial stint was an unhappy one as he immediately moved to Blackpool, who were bottom of the Championship. Relegation followed and he resigned in May 2015. Rae thinks it would be wrong to read too much into this dismal spell at the Seasiders. \"The one thing about working for Blackpool - I was there as well - it is a really tough, tough environment to work in,\" he said. \"The downsizing in terms of the playing budget almost made it impossible to succeed there. I would not judge Lee on that last tenure.\" The Killie board clearly like what they see in Clark but he is entering an environment he has little experience of. The 43-year-old is joining a club where money is tight and this will present challenges. He will need to be resourceful to make changes. There is precious little breathing space at the foot of the Premiership and the stakes are high for a club that could certainly do without enduring the financial hardship relegation would bring. 'Big prospect' is a tag that has hung around Clark both as player and boss. That is no longer the case and there is a sense of unrealised potential. But there is clearly a hunger to succeed as well. Kilmarnock may not be a final throw of the dice for Clark but there are only so many chances for managers in a highly competitive marketplace.

{"original_text": "Food price inflation was 4.9 in June, compared with 3.2 in May, with rising pork prices partly to blame. While the headline inflation number was above analysts' expectations, it remains comfortably within the government's annual target range of 3 percent, plus or minus one percentage point, giving it room to support economic growth. Pork prices were up 13.4 percent year-on-year, while chicken prices were 8.3 percent higher. Prices of eggs, vegetables and fruits also rose. The data comes amid a scandal in China's pork industry after a large-scale contamination of the pig supply chain was discovered earlier this year. The country has been hit by the African Swine Fever which has decimated its pig population, leading to the price of pork, a staple of the Chinese diet, to soar by over 20 percent in the last year. Beijing is looking at ways to support the domestic pig production industry and keep prices of pork, which is widely considered a key barometer of consumer inflation, under control. The government is looking at ways to lower the price of food in China. Earlier this month, it announced a plan to cut import tariffs on certain consumer goods from July 1. Consumer inflation for the first half of this year was 2.2 percent. It comes after China reported its slowest growth in 27 years on Monday, with the economy expanding 6.2 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, down from 6.4 percent in the first quarter. Earlier this week, the central bank announced more measures to support the economy. It said it would \"increase credit support, strengthen policy coordination and increase policy resilience.\" The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it would further cut its medium-term lending facility (MLF) rates, introduce a new loan pricing method and lower interest rates on loans for small and medium-sized businesses. The MLF is a key policy rate set by the central bank to guide liquidity in the banking system. The PBOC also said it would support small banks' businesses with a targeted reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in the third quarter. \"China's economy is still facing downward pressure amid external uncertainties. But there is ample room for policy maneuvering and plenty of policy tools to respond to the challenges,\" PBOC Governor Yi Gang said in a statement. He added that the central bank will \"resolutely counter any excessive volatility in the financial market.\" China's central bank has injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the country's financial system over the past few months, to help with liquidity shortages, amid signs that the trade war with the U.S. has begun to weigh on the economy. On Saturday, the PBOC announced that it had cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 0.5 percent in order to support the economy. The RRR is the amount of reserves banks must hold with the central bank. The PBOC said it would lower the RRR for small and medium-sized banks by 0.5 percent and would take effect from July 5.

Bank of China Chairman Chen Siqing said on Tuesday that the Chinese economy is under pressure, but added that the country has \"ample policy tools\" at its disposal. \"I think the recent reduction in the RRR is enough for now, and the government will now shift their focus to supporting the real economy and small businesses,\" said Michael Every, head of Asia-Pacific research at Rabobank. \"The RRR reduction is not so much to boost lending as to boost liquidity,\" he added.

The American regains the number one ranking from German Angelique Kerber. Australia's Margaret Court, with 24, is the only player still ahead of Serena in terms of Grand Slam singles titles. \"Congratulations Serena on number 23,\" said Venus, who at 36 is the oldest Australian Open finalist in the Open era. \"I have been right there with you, some of them I lost right there against you. It's been an awesome win. \"I'm enormously proud of you, you mean the world to me. I, God willing, would love to come back. Thank you for all the love.\" Serena paid tribute to her sister, who was playing her first major final for eight years, saying: \"There's no way I would be at 23 without her. There's no way I'd be at one without her. She's my inspiration. \"She's the only reason I'm standing here today. She's the only reason the Williams sisters exist. Thank you for inspiring me. Every time you won this week, I felt like I got a win too.\" Serena went into the match as a strong favourite, but the tension was apparent as early as the third game when she smashed a racquet in frustration, receiving a code violation. She had broken serve in the first and third games only to hand the advantage straight back each time, three double faults inexplicably littering a desperate game for 2-2. It was clear the six-time champion was struggling to settle, with 13 unforced errors in the opening five games, while elder sister Venus kept her under pressure with some deep hitting. The decisive move of the set came with a superb drop volley followed by a thumping forehand winner from Serena to break for 4-3, and this time she managed to consolidate on serve. In contrast to the opening stages, the following nine games went with serve - Venus recovering superbly from 0-40 early in the second set - but it was Serena who was creating the chances. She finally capitalised on her sixth break point of the set with a brilliant return to lead 4-3 and followed it up with her best service game of the match for 5-3. The crowd on Rod Laver Arena had been backing Venus from the beginning as she tried to win a first major title for eight years, and all the more so as defeat loomed and she appeared to struggle physically. There was a huge cheer when she held serve to force her sister to serve out the match, but Serena recovered from 15-30 to earn match point and fell back on the court in celebration as her sister sent the ball floating wide. Saturday's final was the 28th instalment of the sisters' on-court rivarly, which began at the Australian Open back in 1998, with Serena now 17-11 ahead and 7-2 up in Grand Slam finals. Venus, who turned professional in 1994 and has won five Wimbledon and two US Open titles, insisted she was not too disappointed after reaching her first major final since 2009. \"No, because I guess I've been here before, \"she said. \"I really enjoy seeing the name'Williams' on the trophy. This is a beautiful thing.\" Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent: Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Serena Williams is the length of time she has been winning Grand Slam titles. The first came on 11 September 1999 in New York; the 23rd on 28 January 2017 here in Melbourne. The match itself will quickly be forgotten; but never the achievement. Richard Williams used to beg tennis clubs to part with their old balls when he started to put his daughters through their paces in the Los Angeles district of Compton, and now Serena has more Grand Slam singles titles than anyone who has ever played the game, with the exception of Margaret Court. Williams is now just one behind the Australian - who was watching on the Rod Laver Arena - and in the view of the 18-time Grand Slam champion Martina Navratilova, it is a record she could \"shatter\" before her playing days are done. Billie Jean King on Twitter: Congrats serenawilliams on your 23rd major title and return to the top of the WTA rankings. You are a history maker and a trailblazer.

The American regains the number one ranking from German Angelique Kerber. Australia's Margaret Court, with 24, is the only player still ahead of Serena in terms of Grand Slam singles titles. \"Congratulations Serena on number 23,\" said Venus, who at 36 is the oldest Australian Open finalist in the Open era. \"I have been right there with you, some of them I lost right there against you. It's been an awesome win. \"I'm enormously proud of you, you mean the world to me. I, God willing, would love to come back. Thank you for all the love.\" Serena paid tribute to her sister, who was playing her first major final for eight years, saying: \"There's no way I would be at 23 without her. There's no way I'd be at one without her. She's my inspiration. \"She's the only reason I'm standing here today. She's the only reason the Williams sisters exist. Thank you for inspiring me. Every time you won this week, I felt like I got a win too.\" Serena went into the match as a strong favourite, but the tension was apparent as early as the third game when she smashed a racquet in frustration, receiving a code violation. She had broken serve in the first and third games only to hand the advantage straight back each time, three double faults inexplicably littering a desperate game for 2-2. It was clear the six-time champion was struggling to settle, with 13 unforced errors in the opening five games, while elder sister Venus kept her under pressure with some deep hitting. The decisive move of the set came with a superb drop volley followed by a thumping forehand winner from Serena to break for 4-3, and this time she managed to consolidate on serve. In contrast to the opening stages, the following nine games went with serve - Venus recovering superbly from 0-40 early in the second set - but it was Serena who was creating the chances. She finally capitalised on her sixth break point of the set with a brilliant return to lead 4-3 and followed it up with her best service game of the match for 5-3. The crowd on Rod Laver Arena had been backing Venus from the beginning as she tried to win a first major title for eight years, and all the more so as defeat loomed and she appeared to struggle physically. There was a huge cheer when she held serve to force her sister to serve out the match, but Serena recovered from 15-30 to earn match point and fell back on the court in celebration as her sister sent the ball floating wide. Saturday's final was the 28th instalment of the sisters' on-court rivarly, which began at the Australian Open back in 1998, with Serena now 17-11 ahead and 7-2 up in Grand Slam finals. Venus, who turned professional in 1994 and has won five Wimbledon and two US Open titles, insisted she was not too disappointed after reaching her first major final since 2009. \"No, because I guess I've been here before, \"she said. \"I really enjoy seeing the name'Williams' on the trophy.

Bartley has started all 11 league games for Leeds this season and scored his second goal in the 2-2 draw at Aston Villa last week, a result that took Leeds to within four points of the play-off places. The defender's strike, which levelled the scores in the 84th minute, was his first in more than two years, and it was also the first time he has scored in a draw. \"It's hard to beat that feeling,\" he said. \"It was a really good point and I'm just happy to score and get on the scoresheet again. \"You go through the levels of despair and frustration - you can't put into words what you're feeling - and you're just trying to get through it. \"Thankfully we've managed to get a point out of the game and now we can concentrate on the next game against Reading. \"It's not the best time to be playing Reading because they're doing really well.

Stevie Mallan though had earlier missed the game's best chance for the home side when he failed to score from the penalty spot. St Mirren now lead Group G by three points. It might have been picture postcard weather for the first half in Paisley, but there wasn't much to write home about. St Mirren were too predictable with long balls floated forward for John Sutton and David Clarkson up front, although Mallan's dead ball delivery was, as always, a threat.

{"original_text": "Edward Alexander Lee, 34, was sentenced to three years on probation at Belfast Crown Court on Wednesday. Judge Gordon Kerr QC said it was the best way of protecting society. The court heard Lee had been in a relationship with his victim for six years, but after breaking up the pair remained friends. However, on June 24 this year he repeatedly contacted his ex-girlfriend, asking her to meet him at his home. He then repeatedly contacted her throughout the night, telling her he loved her and they should get back together. When the victim refused to have contact with him, he began throwing items at her car. The woman managed to get away, but Lee then began to send her threatening messages. He told her he would burn her car and kill her, the court heard. Lee also told her he would come to her home and \"smash her face in.\" The threats continued for several weeks, and Lee also began sending messages to the victim's family. When he appeared at Newtownards Magistrates' Court last month, it was revealed the defendant had 64 previous convictions for 121 offences. Prosecution barrister Robin Steer said it was \"obvious\" Lee was trying to \"control\" his victim. He said Lee had been \"fixated on her,\" and was jealous when she was with someone else. Defence barrister Neil Moore said Lee had been \"completely honest\" with police, and had been \"full of remorse.\" Mr Moore said Lee had been drinking heavily at the time and was \"out of his mind.\" He said Lee had tried to put himself on bail when he knew he would be going to prison. But Judge Kerr told Lee: \"These were very frightening and threatening messages which continued for a period of weeks. \"The effect on your victim was significant, she was terrified of what you were doing. \"Your conduct had a very serious effect on her.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "A Newtownards man who threatened to burn his ex-girlfriend's car and \"smash her face in\" has been given a probation order."}

The government has said it would consider toughening the law if there was evidence of serious injuries. Speaking during the debate in the Commons, Kettering MP Mr Hollobone said: \"The big problem with fireworks is that the general public are allowed to buy and let off individual fireworks. \"They are extremely dangerous things.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon's report called for an international convention on \"crimes committed in peacekeeping operations.\" He also urged countries to change their laws so that they apply to sex crimes committed by citizens serving in UN peace operations. Mr Ban also called for \"on-site court martial proceedings\" for some crimes and a DNA database of all peacekeepers. UN peacekeepers operate under the legal jurisdiction of their home countries, making prosecution more difficult. In February, the UN said it would send home more than 100 peacekeepers from CAR following sexual abuse allegations. A 10,000-strong UN force took over a peacekeeping mission in the country in September 2014. After CAR, the second highest number of allegations was at the UN peacekeeping mission in Congo, with 16 cases, followed by Haiti with nine."}

Hayes Fuels director Allister Hayes and risk manager Stanley Gibson both pleaded guilty at Belfast Crown Court Mr Gibson pleaded guilty to two charges, while Mr Hayes, on behalf of his company, pleaded guilty to charges of failing to ensure the safety of its employees and failing to ensure the safe storage of materials and objects. The family of Mr McCarroll, a 49-year-old grand-father, was present in court when details of the events surrounding his death were outlined to the court. A prosecution lawyer told the judge that on the day of the accident on 27 March 2013, heavy goods vehicle driver Brian Wilshaw was at the yard where his lorry was being loaded with mixed coals and briquettes. \"Mr Wilshaw flagged down Mr McCarroll in his forklift truck and he put two of three full pallets of coal on the lorry,\" the prosecution lawyer said. \"Mr McCarroll and Mr Wilshaw were in shed two on the premises calculating the number of briquettes on a slack pallet which had been already been picked up from the ground. \"The full pallets needed by Mr Wilshaw were still in the shed and while he was engaged in gathering loose briquettes from this area, Mr McCarroll was standing on the slack pallet counting the bales. \"Mr McCarroll pulled a bale out and had time to set this on the ground, at which stage, two pallet stacks fell on top of him. \"Mr Wilshaw shouted a warning but Mr McCarroll was unable to avoid being hit.\" The court heard that medical assistance was called to the yard but Mr McCarroll died two days later on 29 March from chest and pelvic injuries. The judge was told that the Health and Safety Executive of Northern Ireland (HSENI) found a number of breaches by Hayes Fuels, including: HSENI said that Hayes Fuels should have used an overlapping or'staircase' system to store pallets.

The Stanley Gibson Partnership provided \"numerous risk assessments\" to Hayes Fuels and lignite materials (briquettes) was intended to be included in the risk for solid fuels. \"However, there is no account mentioned to matters such as the size of pallets how the pallet and load base varied or how the lignite pallets are to be stacked,\" the prosecution lawyer said. \"It considered that the risk assessments and safety audit completed by Stanley Gibson Partnership were neither adequate nor sufficient.\" The court heard that Mr McCarroll's partner, Barbara Thompson, had \"suffered both emotionally and financially from the loss of her long-term partner.\" The prosecution lawyer added that his only son Christopher had suffered \"disruption to his employment and sleep patterns in the wake of his father's untimely death.\" The court heard the maximum penalty that could be imposed was an unlimited fine andor two years in prison.

James Tomlinson picked up two scalps, including Ireland captain William Porterfield (29), before Chopra guided his side to safety. Despite scoring just 26 runs in the post-lunch session, Chopra scored more freely as he moved towards his first century as Warwickshire skipper. The draw came shortly after Ambrose chipped a full delivery from Will Smith to Gareth Berg at extra-cover. The wicket-keeper batted for an hour with a runner after suffering a gluteal strain before tea, which may rule him out of Sunday's game against champions Yorkshire. Warwickshire captain Varun Chopra: \"They bowled well and made it hard for us to score on a pitch which got slower the longer the game went. \"At the start of the day our intention was to go for the win but it was a case of taking it session by session. After Sam Hain got out and we were four wickets down, and we didn't really have any momentum to the scoring, it was always going to be pretty tough. \"But overall I was quite pleased with the way we played. There were some good performances from us, with a six-for and two centuries.\" Hampshire captain Jimmy Adams: \"At the start of the last day I thought a draw was probably the least likely result. \"The previous evening Warwickshire had got away from us a little bit and if they had started the same way today then things could have been a lot different. \"But the guys bowled well and I am really happy with the way we played over the four days.\""}

{"original_text": "He wanted a tribunal to approve a move to a Scottish prison, but Ashworth Hospital said he had chronic mental illness and needed continued care at the Merseyside top-security facility. Brady, now 75, and Myra Hindley, who died in prison in 2002, tortured and murdered five children. He was jailed for three murders in 1966 and has been at Ashworth since 1985. He and Hindley later confessed to another two murders. Judge Robert Atherton, who headed the three-person mental health tribunal at Ashworth, said: \"The tribunal has concluded that Mr Ian Stewart Brady continues to suffer from a mental disorder which is of a nature and degree which makes it appropriate for him to continue to receive medical treatment, and that it is necessary for his health and safety and for the protection of other persons that he should receive such treatment in hospital, and that appropriate medical treatment is available for him.\" The reasons for the tribunal's decision will be released later. By Dominic CascianiHome affairs correspondent Ashworth Hospital argued that Brady was after \"a win\" over the authorities. This decision, which denies him that victory, comes down to the very narrow legal remit that had to be fulfilled by his mental health tribunal. The panel had one simple duty: to assess the patient's health and what would be clinically right for him. So although we have not yet seen the full reasons, the tribunal's decision means it has decided that Brady is still suffering from paranoid schizophrenia or another treatable disorder. Once it had come to that conclusion, it could further rule that it would be appropriate to keep Brady at Ashworth, either to receive treatment or because it would be necessary for his own safety or those of others. It's going to be very difficult for him to challenge the decision because he can only launch an appeal if he can show that the tribunal got the law wrong. Brady has the right to challenge the decision. Dr David Fearnley, medical director at Ashworth, said: \"We appreciate the time and effort the mental health tribunal has given to this case and its judgment is consistent with the expert opinions of our clinicians. \"Mr Brady suffers from a severe personality disorder and a mental illness which still require high-quality care. \"It is a testament to the staff of Ashworth Hospital that we have been able to stabilise his schizophrenia to the degree we have. However, his condition is chronic and will require this support for the foreseeable future.\" Asked if the tribunal, which was held in public at Brady's request, may have exacerbated the illness, Dr Fearnley said: \"I think the difficulty with an individual such as Ian Brady is that he has a complex mental disorder and for many years has been able to publicise his concerns. \"However, we see this as part of an overall problem which our experts are looking into and will continue to provide expert care.\" Brady has been on a hunger strike since 1999, and appeared at the tribunal with his feeding tube in place. The tribunal heard that he also eats some food on \"most days.\" Dr Fearnley said his treatment was under review by the specialist team, including the issue of feeding. Brady and Hindley's crimes of sexual abuse, torture and murder of children shocked the nation. Lesley Ann Downey, 10, John Kilbride, 12, Keith Bennett, 12, and Pauline Reade, 16, were all sexually assaulted before their deaths at the hands of the couple. Their bodies were buried on Saddleworth Moor, near Manchester, although Keith Bennett's body was never found. Their final victim, Edward Evans, 17, was murdered in front of Hindley's 17-year-old brother-in-law, who alerted the police. Keith's mother, Winnie Johnson, made repeated calls for Brady to reveal the location of his grave. She died last year, aged 78, without knowing where her son's remains are. Her solicitor John Ainley said he thought she would have been \"satisfied\" by the tribunal's decision. \"She always felt that Ian Brady did not give the children any choice and consequently he should not have the choice to leave the hospital environment.\" Terry Kilbride, the brother of John, said Brady should stay in hospital. \"I don't believe he's going to kill himself, that's just a ploy, just another wind-up. \"I think to be honest he should go back to hospital, I think that's where he belongs, in the hospital, and keep him alive as long as possible because it's only him that knows where Keith Bennett is.\" Brady gave evidence for more than four hours at the tribunal, which sat at Ashworth psychiatric hospital in Maghull. It was the first time he had spoken in public for 47 years. Brady had told the tribunal he used \"method acting\" to trick doctors into classing him as insane so he could be transferred from prison to hospital. But he said he now wanted to leave Ashworth because he hated it and \"the regime has changed to a penal warehouse.\" The tribunal heard from Brady's lawyer that Brady had a severe personality disorder but was not mentally ill and could be treated in prison rather than hospital.

{"original_text": "The men from the 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment sat on the floor when ordered to stand to attention. The protest by 16 soldiers was sparked by grievances with their food, accommodation and their NCOs. The men, from B Company, 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment, have been based in the Sangin area of Helmand province since June. The protest came as the Ministry of Defence revealed that the number of British troops serving in Afghanistan has reached an all-time high of 9,500. With a further 1,000 deployed in the country to provide support, the total number of British personnel in the country is now more than 10,500. The protest at the British base, known as FOB Jackson, was on 12 October and lasted about an hour, during which time a platoon commander and a company sergeant major took over the company's headquarters and removed the soldiers' rifles. The soldiers were moved to another part of the base, where they remained until the end of the day. They were then returned to their company lines. The platoon commander and company sergeant major did not receive support from their superiors and were unable to restore order. The incident was not reported to higher authorities and it was only when an officer from another unit happened to visit the base the following day and saw the \"stand down\" order on the notice board that it came to the attention of the chain of command. An inquiry is under way but it is understood that the platoon commander is still on the base. The soldiers' grievances focused on the food and accommodation provided to them. The base was surrounded by high security fences but was without walls, meaning that the soldiers had to sleep in bunkers, where the temperature could drop as low as -5C during the night. They also complained that the food provided to them was not to the same standard as that given to the rest of the battalion. The incident comes as tensions between the British and the Dutch have worsened. Nato commanders had hoped that the two forces would work together to secure the main highway through Helmand province but their operations in the area have frequently clashed.

The protest at the British base, known as FOB Jackson, was on 12 October and lasted about an hour, during which time a platoon commander and a company sergeant major took over the company's headquarters and removed the soldiers' rifles. The soldiers were moved to another part of the base, where they remained until the end of the day. They were then returned to their company lines. The platoon commander and company sergeant major did not receive support from their superiors and were unable to restore order. The incident was not reported to higher authorities and it was only when an officer from another unit happened to visit the base the following day and saw the \"stand down\" order on the notice board that it came to the attention of the chain of command. An inquiry is under way but it is understood that the platoon commander is still on the base. The soldiers' grievances focused on the food and accommodation provided to them. The base was surrounded by high security fences but was without walls, meaning that the soldiers had to sleep in bunkers, where the temperature could drop as low as -5C during the night. They also complained that the food provided to them was not to the same standard as that given to the rest of the battalion. The incident comes as tensions between the British and the Dutch have worsened. Nato commanders had hoped that the two forces would work together to secure the main highway through Helmand province but their operations in the area have frequently clashed. The Dutch have come under repeated attack by the Taliban and have requested reinforcements in a bid to drive the insurgents from the area."}
{"original_text": "It was relief more than real jubilation. The simple truth was that the combined list of candidates headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had performed disappointingly. But politics is about toppling your opponent. In the end, Netanyahu's Likud won 30 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, to 24 for the Zionist Union, the center-left alliance headed by Isaac Herzog. The difference was not as great as in the last two elections, when Likud had a comfortable lead over Kadima and Labor. But the margin was sufficient to give Netanyahu first crack at forming a government. Herzog's announcement that he would not join Netanyahu's government was gracious but a foregone conclusion. Given the vast ideological gulf between the two parties, it was not surprising that Herzog chose to continue to lead the opposition. Another consideration, however, was his own internal opposition. Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid, who has far more political ambitions than Herzog, openly warned his colleague not to join Netanyahu's government. He also insisted that the only way to prevent Netanyahu from forming a government was to refuse to cooperate. That approach was unrealistic. After all, the Zionist Union had fewer seats than Likud and was in no position to force anyone to do anything. And had it refused to join, Netanyahu would have had no trouble finding a right-wing government. In any case, Herzog has no more desire to serve in a Netanyahu cabinet than Lapid does. The former Labor leader may be a bit more pragmatic, and thus less doctrinaire, than his party rival. But he, too, knows that his future political prospects depend on not being tainted by association with Netanyahu. The most likely scenario is that Netanyahu will form a government with his natural partners on the right, including the Jewish Home, the settler party led by Naftali Bennett, and Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu. Together, the three could give Netanyahu as many as 55 seats, but that is still not a majority of the Knesset. Netanyahu could also make an effort to bring Lapid into the fold, though the likelihood of success is slim. Lapid has no reason to join a coalition that is going to be far more right-wing than he likes. Finally, there is the option of a national unity government with Herzog and the Zionist Union. But Herzog's statement after the election makes that seem unlikely. In addition to the ideological gap, the two men just don't like each other. Herzog would also face the same kind of opposition from his own party that Lapid did from Yesh Atid. Netanyahu has until mid-May to form a coalition, but he will almost certainly make his effort to do so quickly. Given that there are more ideological reasons for parties to join a right-wing government than a center-left one, it is likely that he will have little trouble putting together a cabinet by mid-April. The winner of the election was really Netanyahu's campaign advisers, who focused their message on fears of an untrustworthy Herzog in a government that would be dependent on Arab parties for its survival. And the loser was the media, which pounded the idea that this was the election in which the Arab parties would be kingmakers. The problem for Netanyahu is that he will have to govern in a country whose electorate is far more moderate than the Knesset he will preside over. The Arab parties, which are a greater concern to most Israelis than to those who voted for them, will now be more of a factor in Israeli politics. The Jewish Home and Yisrael Beiteinu will pull Netanyahu's government to the right. That means that if Netanyahu wants to stay in power for the long haul, he will need to accommodate the views of those who voted for Lapid, Herzog and Tzipi Livni, who is likely to find a way to enter Netanyahu's government. He'll also have to accommodate the Obama administration, which is eager to see progress in peace negotiations with the Palestinians. Given that he has already ruled out a two-state solution, the best he can do is an interim agreement that would freeze settlement construction and provide for an upgrade in the Palestinian economy.

The Scottish Football Association (SFA) and Scottish Gymnastics both had their funding cut by 500,000 and 268,000 respectively. Scottish Cycling and the Scottish Rugby Union were each hit with cuts of 100,000 and 140,000. However, it was Scottish Athletics which had the biggest cut at 250,000. A spokesman for Scottish Athletics told the BBC: \"The whole of sport has taken a hit and it is not just us, but we are working with Sportscotland to try and reverse this decision.\" Whilst Sportscotland's budget was cut by 2.2 million, the funding for the country's 22 Olympic and Paralympic sports is reported to have been cut by 20 million. Sportscotland is the national agency for sport, and it is tasked with ensuring that everyone has equal access to sporting opportunities and talented individuals can develop their skills to the highest level.

He gave no details about what the security assistance would entail. The move was quickly criticised by rights groups. Sarah Margon, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch, said that the decision to lift restrictions was taking place without any \"real or meaningful political reform\" in Bahrain. She said in a statement that \"Bahrain's jails are bursting at the seams with political detainees and the recent prison sentence for political opposition leader, al-Wefaq secretary general Sheikh Ali Salman, means that a political accommodation remains as far away as ever.\" Earlier in June, Sheikh Salman was jailed for four years for inciting hatred, promoting disobedience and \"insulting\" public institutions. Shia-dominated demonstrations against Bahrain's Sunni monarchy have occurred sporadically since 2011. Dozens died when the government moved to quash protests four years ago."}

Manufacturers reported their highest growth in two years, with new orders and production increasing strongly. However, firms also reported that rising prices for raw materials are putting pressure on margins. Retailers continue to report healthy growth in sales. Strong sales of seasonal and summer ranges helped boost demand. However, retailers noted that the current hot weather is negatively affecting sales of winter ranges. Employment in the sector is rising, but some retailers noted that it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit staff. Construction firms saw business activity growth slow, with some firms reporting that the recent heatwave had affected demand. However, firms reported a strong increase in new orders. New car sales continue to fall, with manufacturers reporting a reduction in sales for the twelfth consecutive month. Car manufacturers also noted that new car stocks are increasing, leading to an increase in discounting. Josh Hardie, CBI Deputy Chief Policy Director, said: \"The UK's all-important services sector maintained solid growth momentum at the end of the first half of the year, though pressure on margins from rising costs is still weighing on the outlook for the sector. The manufacturing sector is enjoying its best spell of growth since 2014, driven by the boost to exporters from the weaker pound and a strong global economy. But construction firms saw growth cool, with some firms reporting that the recent heatwave had affected demand. \"Looking ahead, the performance of the economy will continue to be driven by the rate of expansion of the dominant services sector. The outlook is clouded by heightened levels of uncertainty, with Brexit, rising costs, and skill shortages likely to weigh on growth. \"With the economy growing at its joint-slowest pace since 2016, and inflation remaining above target, we need a pro-growth agenda that will help to lift the economy.

You could build a paper mountain out of all the plans to give vocational education the same status as university degrees, and the same recognition as the gold standard of academic achievement. Yet it's still a struggle, and most people still think that a degree is the only way to get a good job. This year, as we do every year, we'll take a hard look at our education system and find new ways to improve it. This year, it seems, there's a bit more to the national conversation than usual. We're looking at the national curriculum. What should it cover, what should be compulsory and what should be optional? The schools funding model is being redesigned. What should it look like, and what should it fund? Everybody is looking at how to improve schools, teachers and the system as a whole. It's not surprising, then, that this time around the questions are the same and the debates are reheated. The only thing that's changed is the set of participants, and that's because they're all new. Now there are more new people, and more new plans, and more new debates. The same ideas are being kicked around in different ways. People have different ideas about how to make things better. How to make teachers better. How to make schools better. How to make students better. How to make things fairer and more equal. There are lots of ideas. But the ideas aren't the problem. The problem is that the only thing we really know is that the education system is the way it is because that's the way it's always been. You can redesign the curriculum, but that's just the syllabus. You can change the funding model, but that's just the budget. What you can't change is the context. You can't change the fact that the education system is an industrialised, mass-production model that is designed to deliver a standardised product. The problem is that it can't deliver that standardised product in a way that meets the needs of every student. Some students need to be faster, some students need to be slower, some need more time and attention, and some need less. Every student is different, and it's the system that's broken.

This is for testing missiles. Since 1992 the RAAF has operated 24 FA-18A Hornet fighter jets. These are used in combat missions, and are also used for training purposes. There are 24 FA-18B Hornet two-seater jets. These are used for training purposes, and also for target towing. The Hornets were built in the United States and then assembled in Australia. The RAAF has 16 FA-18F Super Hornet jets, which entered service in 2010. The F-111C bomber jets entered service with the RAAF in 1973. The RAAF received 24 F-111C jets from the United States.

{"original_text": "It may be their signature pose, but how and why the birds perch on one limb has been a longstanding puzzle. Now, a team from the US has shown that flamingos employ no active muscular effort when they're unipedal, meaning they are also expending less energy. A passive mechanism is engaged in the one-legged position, allowing flamingos to stand proud while having a doze. Previously, researchers had wondered whether the one-legged position might help reduce muscle fatigue, as the birds alternated from standing on one leg to the other. Other teams have proposed that this behaviour helps regulate body temperature. Now, Prof Young-Hui Chang, from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) in Atlanta, and Lena H Ting, of Atlanta's Emory University, have uncovered the mechanical secrets behind this impressive trick. The researchers conducted several experiments with both live and dead birds. Amazingly, they found that flamingo cadavers could be made to stand one-legged without any external support. In a paper published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, they describe this phenomenon as a \"passive gravitational stay mechanism.\" \"If you look at the bird from the front, while they're standing on one leg, the foot is directly beneath the body which means that their leg is angled inward. That's the pose you have to strike in order to engage the stay mechanism,\" Prof Chang told BBC News. However, dead birds cannot stand unsupported on two legs, suggesting a greater role for active muscle force in this posture: \"If you tilt it to the vertical, like you would if you were standing on two legs, the whole thing disengages,\" said the director of the Comparative Neuromechanics Laboratory at Georgia Tech. The researchers also studied live birds, and showed that when they were standing one-legged and resting, they hardly moved at all - underlining the stability of this passive position. However, the birds did sway somewhat when the one-legged posture was combined with an activity, such as grooming or calling out. Prof Chang said the underlying anatomical apparatus that enables the passive posture was not yet understood - this is the next step in the team's research. But he explained that the phenomenon did not involve the limb joints locking. \"A lock would imply that it's fixed in both directions. What we found is that it's fixed in one direction, but flexible in the other direction, so we call it a'stay' rather than a'lock'. It's more akin to a doorstop,\" he told me. Dr Matthew Anderson, an experimental psychologist who specialises in animal behaviour at St Joseph's University in Philadelphia, described the team's results as a \"significant step forward.\" The researcher, who was not involved with the latest study, added: \"They begin to answer the question of how flamingos are able to rest on one leg. Importantly, these authors do not examine when and where flamingos actually utilise the behaviour in question, and thus this paper does not really address the issue of why flamingos rest while on one leg.\" Dr Anderson's own research suggests that the birds adopt the unusual posture in order to conserve heat.

{"original_text": "Police forces tasked with implementing strict state interpretations of Islamic morality exist in several other states, including Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Malaysia. Many - especially those with an affinity with the Muslim Brotherhood - favour the re-introduction of these laws in Egypt. However, the majority of Egyptians reject a strict form of Islamic law, preferring instead to see an Egypt where people are allowed to follow their own religious beliefs without state interference. In Aceh, Indonesia, a strict form of Islamic law called Syariah is currently being implemented by a local government that has its own police force. The implementation of Syariah, which criminalizes 'immoral' behaviour such as homosexuality, is supported by some Achenese citizens, who feel it will help preserve their cultural traditions. However, many Achenese citizens believe that their government's interpretation of Syariah is too strict. The Syariah police in Aceh, Indonesia, have been criticised for their aggressive tactics. There have been numerous reports of the Syariah police using excessive force, which has resulted in the deaths of a number of citizens. Several people have also been killed during violent clashes between the Syariah police and citizens who oppose the implementation of Islamic law. Local government officials, who are often linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, have been accused of using the Syariah police to further their own political and economic interests. Many critics believe that the Syariah police are not acting on behalf of the majority of Achenese citizens. In 2005, the Egyptian government approved a new constitution that formally recognised Islam as the country's main religion. Several leading members of the Muslim Brotherhood have said they hope to introduce a similar system of law to that of Aceh in Egypt.

Emergency services at the London hospital have been rated \"inadequate.\" The hospital said it was \"extremely sorry\" for the problems in the unit. Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission said there were too few competent doctors who were able to assess and treat patients at night when they inspected the department in April and May. The unit - which sees 500 hundred patients a day - logged 22 serious incidents in the past year, including the dead patient not being found for hours. Others included a patient being left sitting on a bedpan for more than an hour. And nurse to patient ratios were rarely achieved because they frequently had 20 patients being treated in the corridor. The report also said staff were afraid to speak up for fear of retribution. The inspection of the emergency department and two of the hospital's medical wards was in response to concerns about the standards of care. The hospital has apologised to patients and says the AE department now has five additional doctors and consultants on loan from other London trusts, a new nursing lead and new clinical director. Chief Inspector of Hospitals Sir Mike Richards said the hospital has already \"turned a corner\" since the inspection. He said: \"A new leadership team is in place in the emergency department, there are moves to appoint more senior doctors - and I note that the trust is calling on consultants from other departments within the hospital to provide the routine daily support to A and E which is so badly needed. \"There is still much more that needs to be done. We will be watching their progress very closely.\" David Burrowes, MP for Enfield Southgate, said he was left to wait for 12 hours on a trolley with a ruptured appendix in the emergency department in 2014. He said \"urgent action\" was needed. \"The important question is why the warning signals from at least two years ago were not heeded,\" he added Tottenham MP David Lammy said the \"damning\" report is \"even worse than I feared\" and demanded answers from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. He said: \"It shocks and appals me that this situation has been left for so long without an intervention from the Health Secretary, and the way that this has been covered up is nothing short of a scandal.\" During the same inspection, medical care services were rated as requiring improvement.

{"original_text": "Culture Secretary Maria Miller said \"decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table\" during the BBC's charter review before 2017. The BBC said changing the law could lead to a \"fairer and more proportionate\" system. Households that do not pay the licence fee can be fined up to 1,000 and sent to prison for up to three months. The BBC said that a more civilised approach would be to use the services of a collection agency, which would be more efficient and less disruptive to the public. At present, the licence fee is required by law and non-payment is a criminal offence. The BBC argued that moving to a civil debt would see more money recouped than the current criminal system, which is estimated to see only 40 of fines and court costs recovered. The BBC proposed that once the debt had been established, the licence fee payer would be contacted via letter and the bill would increase if it was not paid after 28 days. It said the second letter would include a payment plan and if it was still not paid then the debt would be passed to a collection agency. The BBC added that a civil debt system could make it easier to have a more personalised approach with people who have difficulty paying. A spokesman for the BBC said: \"In order to minimise the burden on the courts, a civil debt system would offer a more proportionate approach, which allows for the timely collection of debts and would enable people who can afford to pay to be prosecuted for their non-payment.\" The corporation said that the proposal was not about reducing the number of people paying the licence fee but making the system more efficient. The BBC spokesman added: \"This is not about taking people to court, it is about having a more efficient system for collecting debts which will mean that more money can be invested in programming and services.\" There is a widespread feeling that the licence fee is an unfair tax, with an estimated 250,000 people prosecuted for non-payment each year. The BBC said that a civil debt system could mean that fewer people would be taken to court, but the costs could increase as more people would be chased for payment. However, the corporation added that the changes could lead to an increase in the number of people paying the licence fee. In the future, the BBC said that the licence fee could be replaced with a household levy, which would be paid for by the owner of a property and would be included in the rates bill. There is no suggestion that the licence fee will be scrapped, but it is possible that the licence fee could be included in a new household levy. Maria Miller said: \"The licence fee will remain as the principle way of funding the BBC, but decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table as part of the charter review before 2017.\" The BBC has also suggested that the household levy could be extended to people who live in a communal home, such as students who share a house.
