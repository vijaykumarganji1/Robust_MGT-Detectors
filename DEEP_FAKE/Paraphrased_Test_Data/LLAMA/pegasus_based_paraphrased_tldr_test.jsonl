{"original_text": "A researcher from the Swiss research institute EMPA has developed an invisible lock system that uses conductive ink on a transparent polymer film to create invisible buttons. The result is an unobtrusive electronic lock that is as easy to use as a regular door handle. The high tech lock consists of a transparent polymer film printed with conductive ink. A door handle is integrated into this film and when the user touches it the electricity flows through the conductive ink, which is connected to a sensor that unlocks the door. A small indicator confirms that the door has been successfully unlocked. The system can also be applied to any surface such as a fridge or safe. This makes the device a viable alternative to traditional locks, which can be easily opened with a key, without the need for any electronic keys or smartphones. The invisible lock can be fitted to any surface. The invisible lock is inexpensive and could be used in many applications such as a safe, fridge, or even a treasure chest. The lock can be connected to any type of electronic control system. The lock has been developed by Michael Studer of the Swiss research institute Empa. The system can be easily adapted to any application. The lock is based on the principle of the \"touch sensor.\" A touch sensor uses a simple electronic circuit to detect the human body. A small voltage is applied to the sensor, which generates a current that flows through the human body to an electrode. The sensor detects this current and calculates the resulting capacitance. When a person touches the sensor, the capacitance increases and the sensor can detect that the touch has occurred. The invisible lock is based on the same principle. When a person touches the \"handle,\" the sensor detects the increase in capacitance and unlocks the door. The sensor is connected to the door via a circuit board. The technology is not new but it has never been used in this way before. The invisible lock can be applied to any surface. The invisible lock is easy to use and can be applied to any surface. The invisible lock could be used to secure a safe, fridge, or even a treasure chest. The invisible lock can be adapted to any application. The transparent polymer film and conductive ink are inexpensive to produce. The invisible lock is based on a relatively simple technology. The lock has a large range of potential applications.

VPNs are services that give users a private connection while using the open internet, ensuring that traffic and activity can't be intercepted or tracked. A VPN is typically used for protecting your information, whether you're on a public Wi-Fi network or not. While Google Fi is technically a VPN, it has some limitations compared to the more powerful, multi-platform VPNs out there. Fi VPN is a part of the Google Fi network, which is a hybrid of Wi-Fi and cellular connections. This is essentially a VPN because it creates a secure connection between your phone and your carrier's servers. The benefit of a VPN like this is that it's baked into the service, so you don't have to download or set up an app. Google Fi's VPN has some drawbacks, however. Most notably, it's only available on Android devices and only for people who use the Google Fi network. This means the VPN will not protect you on other devices (such as your computer or your TV), nor will it work if you're using a different mobile network (such as ATT, Verizon, or Sprint). It will also not work if you're using a Fi data-only SIM, because it requires the Fi Voice app to be installed on your device. You can find Google's VPN in the Fi app on Android. Go to Settings Network Tools VPN. Then, tap on the switch to enable it. You can turn this on and off whenever you want. As Google says, Fi's VPN is set up to \"always be on\" for Google's apps (such as Gmail, Maps, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and more). This is helpful for keeping your information private if you're connecting to a public Wi-Fi network or using cellular data. It also protects you from malicious Wi-Fi networks that could try to steal your data. Fi's VPN does not apply to apps you download from the Play Store. If you want to use a VPN with those apps, you'll need to download a separate VPN app, such as NordVPN or ExpressVPN. In short, Google's Fi VPN is helpful, but it's not enough to protect all of your devices or all of your data. If you're looking for a more powerful VPN, you'll need to find a paid service.

{"original_text": "Uber and Lyft must classify their drivers as employees unless their emergency appeal to block the ruling is successful. The companies have been under pressure for months to reclassify their drivers, but have successfully resisted that characterization. They argue that doing so would dramatically impact their business models. The ruling applies only to California, but could set a precedent for other states. The state Supreme Court on Monday rejected a request by Uber and Lyft to prevent California from classifying their drivers as employees, requiring the companies to pay them more money and benefits. The companies have been under pressure for months to reclassify their drivers, but have successfully resisted that characterization. They argue that doing so would dramatically impact their business models. The state high court denied the companies' request for an emergency stay, but the companies could potentially appeal the decision to the US Supreme Court. The state Supreme Court issued a similar ruling in May 2018, with the California Trucking Association appealing to the US Supreme Court after it was denied a stay. In April 2019, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case, upholding the California ruling. \"We are pleased that the California Supreme Court denied Uber and Lyft's petition to further delay the case. We are one step closer to justice for the more than 100,000 drivers represented in this case,\" Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney for the drivers, said in a statement. \"Today's decision is not only a victory for Uber and Lyft drivers, but also for all workers in California and across the country. The California Supreme Court has now confirmed that in the era of app-based employment, workers' rights do not disappear merely because a worker performs services through an app rather than in person. \"These workers must be treated as employees, not independent contractors, and are therefore entitled to the wage protections afforded by the California Labor Code,\" Liss-Riordan added. In a statement, Lyft said: \"Today, the California Supreme Court decided not to consider Lyft's appeal of a lower court decision and now the case will head back to the trial court. We are deeply disappointed that California's highest court decided not to review this important case and we remain strongly committed to the independent contractor model, which has provided tremendous opportunities for many thousands of drivers across the state.\" \"We will continue to pursue a case at the California Supreme Court that the independent contractor model is lawful and that it should not be stricken,\" a spokesperson for Uber said in a statement. Uber and Lyft have been under pressure for months to reclassify their drivers. In California, the passage of Assembly Bill 5 (AB5) in September is set to codify the state Supreme Court's earlier decision into law. AB5 requires businesses to classify workers as employees rather than independent contractors unless the companies can prove that workers are running their own businesses. Drivers have been protesting and striking for months, demanding that companies classify them as employees. Uber and Lyft have been under pressure for months to reclassify their drivers. The companies argue that doing so would dramatically impact their business models. In August, Uber released the results of an independent study on the effects of reclassification.

The companies have been under pressure for months to reclassify their drivers, but have successfully resisted that characterization. They argue that doing so would dramatically impact their business models. The ruling applies only to California, but could set a precedent for other states. The state Supreme Court on Monday rejected a request by Uber and Lyft to prevent California from classifying their drivers as employees, requiring the companies to pay them more money and benefits. The companies have been under pressure for months to reclassify their drivers, but have successfully resisted that characterization. They argue that doing so would dramatically impact their business models. The state high court denied the companies' request for an emergency stay, but the companies could potentially appeal the decision to the US Supreme Court. The state Supreme Court issued a similar ruling in May 2018, with the California Trucking Association appealing to the US Supreme Court after it was denied a stay. In April 2019, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case, upholding the California ruling. \"We are pleased that the California Supreme Court denied Uber and Lyft's petition to further delay the case. We are one step closer to justice for the more than 100,000 drivers represented in this case,\" Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney for the drivers, said in a statement. \"Today's decision is not only a victory for Uber and Lyft drivers, but also for all workers in California and across the country. The California Supreme Court has now confirmed that in the era of app-based employment, workers' rights do not disappear merely because a worker performs services through an app rather than in person. \"These workers must be treated as employees, not independent contractors, and are therefore entitled to the wage protections afforded by the California Labor Code,\" Liss-Riordan added. In a statement, Lyft said: \"Today, the California Supreme Court decided not to consider Lyft's appeal of a lower court decision and now the case will head back to the trial court. We are deeply disappointed that California's highest court decided not to review this important case and we remain strongly committed to the independent contractor model, which has provided tremendous opportunities for many thousands of drivers across the state.\" \"We will continue to pursue a case at the California Supreme Court that the independent contractor model is lawful and that it should not be stricken,\" a spokesperson for Uber said in a statement. Uber and Lyft have been under pressure for months to reclassify their drivers. In California, the passage of Assembly Bill 5 (AB5) in September is set to codify the state Supreme Court's earlier decision into law. AB5 requires businesses to classify workers as employees rather than independent contractors unless the companies can prove that workers are running their own businesses. Drivers have been protesting and striking for months, demanding that companies classify them as employees. Uber and Lyft have been under pressure for months to reclassify their drivers. The companies argue that doing so would dramatically impact their business models. In August, Uber released the results of an independent study on the effects of reclassification. The study found that the average pretax driver profit in San Francisco was 10.10 an hour. But that study was met with immediate backlash from labor groups. \"The average Uber driver is not profitable, but it's conceivable that some drivers are,\" Stephen Zoepf, the executive director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford University, told CNN Business.

{"original_text": "The Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) is a new type of spacesuit designed for protecting astronauts from the harsh environment of the lunar surface. NASA has plans to use the xEMU for its upcoming mission to the Moon. The xEMU spacesuit is a lot lighter and more flexible than the EMU, which is the type of suit currently used on the International Space Station (ISS). The xEMU is also less expensive to produce than the EMU, with a suit costing 12 million each to make. The goal of the xEMU is to make it easier for astronauts to move around when they are exploring the surface of the Moon. The suit was designed to be easier to put on and take off, as well as easier to move around in. The xEMU is a lot lighter than the EMU, weighing only 23 kilograms (50 pounds) compared to the EMU's 136 kilograms (300 pounds). The xEMU can also be used for other space missions, including trips to other planets and asteroids. The xEMU has a rear-entry design that allows astronauts to sit down while putting it on. The xEMU also has a new life-support system that reduces the number of items that need to be managed and removed. The suit has an integrated thermoregulation system that eliminates the need for a separate undergarment. The suit is made out of the same materials that are used for bulletproof vests, which means it is flexible and protective. The xEMU also has a new lithium-ion battery that weighs less than half of the battery used in the EMU. The suit is also compatible with a new suitport, which is a docking port that allows an astronaut to enter and exit the suit while inside a pressurized room. The suit has a new glove design that provides increased dexterity and comfort. NASA's plans to use the xEMU spacesuit for the Artemis Mission include having four spacesuits for the first crew to the Moon. In 2024, a crew of four astronauts will explore the surface of the Moon for seven days. The Moon landing mission is part of NASA's Artemis Mission. The four astronauts will be the first people to set foot on the Moon since 1972.

{"original_text": "Large and mysterious land carvings have been discovered in India's Thar Desert. The geoglyphs may be the largest-ever graphical depictions designed by humans. They were discovered using Google Earth during an archaeological survey of the area by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The geoglyphs are more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) across and depict a bull, a boat, and a swastika. The swastika is a symbol used by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. It has a long history and does not carry the same associations in Asia that it does in the west. The meaning of the other geoglyphs is not known. At this point it's just speculation. Some have suggested the boat might be a fishing boat, while others wonder if the bull may be a depiction of Nandi, the sacred bull from Hinduism. Google Earth images show the geoglyphs are made of dark lines, which are about 33 feet (10 meters) wide. The walls are thought to be made from a trench that was dug in the dirt. Rocks and stones were then piled along the edges of the ditches, causing the dark color. The geoglyphs are thought to be at least 1,000 years old. Radiocarbon dating will be used to determine exactly how old the geoglyphs are. The images are best viewed from space because the arid environment of the Thar Desert makes it impossible to see them from ground level. There are several other geoglyphs in the Thar Desert, although they are much smaller than the newly-discovered ones. The largest of these is of a human figure with outstretched arms and measures about 90 feet (30 m) in length. Others have been found in the Atacama Desert in Chile, the Great Basin Desert in the United States, and the Middle East.

{"original_text": "Aptera Motors is rolling out the first mass-produced solar car this year. The three-wheeled vehicle is covered in 34 square feet of solar cells, which can provide enough energy to travel 40 miles per day. The Aptera, which looks a bit like an airplane, has two 10-inch wheels in the front and a 20-inch wheel in the back. It weighs just 1,800 pounds, and has a drag coefficient of 0.11, which is extremely low for a car. Its light weight is due to its all-plastic body, which is made out of aircraft-grade composites. The solar cells mounted on the roof provide the extra energy needed to charge the 10-kWh battery pack that powers the Aptera. The solar cells can generate up to 400 watts of power, which is enough to travel 40 miles per day. The Aptera is 164 inches long, 52 inches wide, and 50 inches tall. It can reach a top speed of 90 mph and go from 0 to 60 in less than 10 seconds. The Aptera is also expected to have a 120-mile range from a single charge and a fuel economy of 200 miles per gallon. The first Aptera cars are expected to hit the market later this year, and the price will start at 25,500. The first 20 cars will be produced at the company's California headquarters. Aptera is aiming to build 10,000 vehicles in its first year of production. The company also has plans to begin production of a four-door sedan in 2010. The new sedan, which will be called the Typ-1, will cost 30,000 and have a 100-mile range. The sedan will be offered with a traditional gasoline engine and an electric-only engine. Aptera Motors is taking pre-orders for the Aptera and Typ-1 at the company's Web site. The Aptera is just the latest in a string of three-wheeled cars and vehicles. ZAP is building the Alias, which is a 33,000 three-wheeled electric car that has a range of 100 miles on a single charge. The Alias is also covered in solar panels that generate up to 1 kilowatt of power. The Alias is expected to go on sale in 2009. The three-wheeled car has been a staple in the transportation industry since 1914. Many manufacturers are looking at three-wheeled cars because they are safer, more fuel efficient, and easier to manufacture than their four-wheeled cousins. The three-wheel configuration also allows a car to have a lower center of gravity, which leads to better handling and safety. The federal government also classifies three-wheeled vehicles as motorcycles, which means they are not subject to the same safety regulations as four-wheeled cars. Because of this, three-wheeled cars can have an open frame, which reduces the weight of the car. Three-wheeled cars are also known as \"autocycles\" and they are not required to meet the same crash-test standards as cars. There are a number of \"autocycle\" designs already in the works, including the VW 1-liter car. Even the U.S. military is looking at three-wheelers as a new way to transport troops. The U.S. Marine Corps is planning to use two types of three-wheelers to move troops in and out of combat. One of the vehicles is the two-seat, 250cc-powered, 1,300-pound Polaris RZR, which is a modern take on the classic three-wheeled ATV. The other vehicle is the six-seat, 600-pound, diesel-powered Carrier All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV), which is a modern take on the classic three-wheeled Polaris ATV. The U.S. military is also looking at using three-wheelers as a platform for mobile power generation.

{"original_text": "Research on psychedelic compounds has boomed in the last few years. Many companies are now springing up in the psychedelic sector with the aim of creating new analogs of drugs like psilocybin, LSD and DMT. Many of these drugs are currently at the preclinical stage. Much like the first half of the twentieth century, many of these drugs are being developed without proper scientific information about their effects. Two companies stand out as doing the most in the area of psychedelic research. Ayuasca Analogs Ayahuasca is a blend of two plants that grow in the Amazon. DMT is the main psychoactive compound in this plant and is considered illegal in most countries. However, the plant containing DMT is combined with the plant containing a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). The MAOI helps the body metabolise DMT by blocking the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) which normally degrades DMT. The Ayahuasca compound has been used by Amazonian tribes for thousands of years and is thought to have healing and spiritual properties. In recent years, scientists have been interested in Ayahuasca and have conducted many studies into it. Several companies have developed various Ayahuasca-like drugs with the aim of taking the compound into clinical trials and making it a prescription medicine. Some of these companies include: Phase 3Bio, Brazilian Bio, Mysterium Labs Usona, and Atai. Some of the drugs currently in development include: Ayahuasca analogs: The Ayahuasca compound is a mixture of 2 plants: The MAOI plant: Peganum harmala (syrian rue) The DMT plant: Banisteriopsis caapi (ayahuasca) The Ayahuasca analog, N,N-DMT, is the same compound found in the DMT plant. It is illegal in most countries and it is thought to be a schedule 1 drug. However, it is not scheduled in every country. In the United States, it is a schedule 1 drug. In the United Kingdom, it is a schedule 5 drug. Many companies are developing the N,N-DMT compound for human use. The following companies are developing N,N-DMT compounds: Mysterium Labs: Mysterium Labs is a small company based in New York. The company has developed an Ayahuasca analog called TA-2037 which is similar to N,N-DMT. Mysterium Labs is currently running a Phase 1b clinical trial of TA-2037. The goal of the study is to identify the correct dose of TA-2037 to administer to participants. The company is also exploring the use of TA-2037 for the treatment of various conditions such as substance abuse. The trial is currently recruiting participants. Atai: Atai is a company based in Germany. The company is currently developing an Ayahuasca analog called Ayahuasca Analog 1 (AA1) which is also similar to N,N-DMT. The company is currently looking to run a Phase 1 clinical trial of AA1. Brazilian Bio: Brazilian Bio is a company based in Brazil. The company is currently developing an Ayahuasca analog called Ayahuasca Analog 3 (AA3) which is also similar to N,N-DMT. The company is currently looking to run a Phase 1 clinical trial of AA3. Phase 3 Bio: Phase 3 Bio is a company based in the USA. The company is currently developing an Ayahuasca analog called Aya-2 which is also similar to N,N-DMT. The company is currently looking to run a Phase 1 clinical trial of Aya-2. Psilocybin Analogs Psilocybin is a compound that occurs in nature.

Many companies are now springing up in the psychedelic sector with the aim of creating new analogs of drugs like psilocybin, LSD and DMT. Many of these drugs are currently at the preclinical stage. Much like the first half of the twentieth century, many of these drugs are being developed without proper scientific information about their effects. Two companies stand out as doing the most in the area of psychedelic research. Ayuasca Analogs Ayahuasca is a blend of two plants that grow in the Amazon. DMT is the main psychoactive compound in this plant and is considered illegal in most countries. However, the plant containing DMT is combined with the plant containing a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). The MAOI helps the body metabolise DMT by blocking the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) which normally degrades DMT. The Ayahuasca compound has been used by Amazonian tribes for thousands of years and is thought to have healing and spiritual properties. In recent years, scientists have been interested in Ayahuasca and have conducted many studies into it. Several companies have developed various Ayahuasca-like drugs with the aim of taking the compound into clinical trials and making it a prescription medicine. Some of these companies include: Phase 3Bio, Brazilian Bio, Mysterium Labs Usona, and Atai. Some of the drugs currently in development include: Ayahuasca analogs: The Ayahuasca compound is a mixture of 2 plants: The MAOI plant: Peganum harmala (syrian rue) The DMT plant: Banisteriopsis caapi (ayahuasca) The Ayahuasca analog, N,N-DMT, is the same compound found in the DMT plant. It is illegal in most countries and it is thought to be a schedule 1 drug. However, it is not scheduled in every country. In the United States, it is a schedule 1 drug. In the United Kingdom, it is a schedule 5 drug. Many companies are developing the N,N-DMT compound for human use. The following companies are developing N,N-DMT compounds: Mysterium Labs: Mysterium Labs is a small company based in New York. The company has developed an Ayahuasca analog called TA-2037 which is similar to N,N-DMT. Mysterium Labs is currently running a Phase 1b clinical trial of TA-2037. The goal of the study is to identify the correct dose of TA-2037 to administer to participants. The company is also exploring the use of TA-2037 for the treatment of various conditions such as substance abuse. The trial is currently recruiting participants. Atai: Atai is a company based in Germany. The company is currently developing an Ayahuasca analog called Ayahuasca Analog 1 (AA1) which is also similar to N,N-DMT. The company is currently looking to run a Phase 1 clinical trial of AA1. Brazilian Bio: Brazilian Bio is a company based in Brazil. The company is currently developing an Ayahuasca analog called Ayahuasca Analog 3 (AA3) which is also similar to N,N-DMT. The company is currently looking to run a Phase 1 clinical trial of AA3. Phase 3 Bio: Phase 3 Bio is a company based in the USA. The company is currently developing an Ayahuasca analog called Aya-2 which is also similar to N,N-DMT. The company is currently looking to run a Phase 1 clinical trial of Aya-2. Psilocybin Analogs Psilocybin is a compound that occurs in nature. It is the active ingredient in 'magic mushrooms' which are found in various parts of the world. Many companies are developing psilocybin analogs for clinical trials.

Here's a sample of what the meeting discussed. 2. The meeting started with a video - lots of bright colors and pop music - which I can only assume was intended to be a counterpoint to the public mood. \"When we think about the journey of our company, 2018 was undoubtedly a difficult and disappointing year.\" \"But as I reflect on it, I feel this sense of optimism.\" 4. \"We have faced and will continue to face significant challenges. But we're making steady progress.\" \"We've been working on these issues for more than two years, but it takes time to get all of this right.\" 5. The company is \"making progress\" on these issues. 6. \"The world has never been more connected. And more people have never been online than today.\" \"We're helping people connect with their families and friends in ways that were never possible before.\" 7. \"We've been able to build a global community of more than two billion people.\" \"That's a pretty big deal.\" 8. \"We're building tools that give people a voice. And we're helping people stay informed.\" \"We're making it possible to bring people together for causes they care about.\" 9. \"We're helping people find jobs and a way to move out of poverty.\" \"We're helping small businesses succeed.\" 10. \"We're making it possible for people to have more meaningful interactions with each other.\" 11. \"And we're bringing people together who are far away from each other.\" 12. \"But we're also building a place where people can come together to participate in a community.\" \"We're the connective tissue for communities.\" 13. \"We're building technology to make sure that people can engage in the political process and have a voice.\" \"We want to make sure that people have a way to represent their views.\" \"In 2018, we've worked hard to prevent our products from being used to undermine democracy.\" 14. We're also working to protect people's right to privacy and data. \"We're holding ourselves to a higher standard.\" 15. \"And we're starting to see real momentum.\" \"When we think about Facebook's place in the world, we need to focus on connecting people and building communities.\" 16. \"We need to bring the world closer together.\" \"We have to build new experiences.\" \"We need to build new technologies.\" \"We need to build new ways of doing business.\" \"We need to build new partnerships.\" 17. The company has already been working on some of these problems for a long time. 18. In the past year, we've seen the good that we can do. 19. Facebook is a place for people to organize and to come together. 20. We're helping people share their stories and bringing families together. 21. We're helping people find a job. 22. We're helping people find their lost friends. 23. We're helping people raise money for causes they care about. 24. We're helping people stay safe in a crisis. 25. \"This year we made a lot of progress, but we still have a long way to go.\" 26. \"If we can get this right, we can help create a more connected, kinder world.\" 27. \"We have a responsibility to move fast, and we have a responsibility to move well.\" 28. \"We need to keep taking the long view.\" 29. \"The journey is 1 finished.\" 30. \"I'm incredibly optimistic about the future.\" 31. \"When I think about what we've built here, what we've achieved here, I'm so proud of this place"}

{"original_text": "This article describes a vulnerability within iCloud Sharing and Safari 15 that allowed hackers to gain unauthorized camera access on Macs. It details how the vulnerability was discovered and how it was fixed. iCloud sharing is a feature that allows users to share files and documents with a link that can be sent to other people. Safari 15 is the current browser version for macOS 10.15 Catalina, launched in October 2019. Safari has been using the same rendering engine, WebKit, for 13 years now, which is an extremely long time in a space that is rapidly changing. iCloud Sharing is a feature that allows users to share files and documents with a link that can be sent to other people. The recipient clicks the link, then they are asked to log into their iCloud account if they are not already logged in. After they log in, the recipient is able to view the shared files. The files are accessed via a webpage that displays a list of the files available for download. This web page is hosted on Apple's own servers. By default, the web page is opened in Safari. The file list web page has a \"View Files\" button that allows the recipient to download the files. When the user clicks on the \"View Files\" button, Safari opens up a new window and loads the file list page using the WebKit engine. This new window has the exact same URL as the original window, however the parent window is still present and visible. The original window is rendered differently by Safari. It is rendered using the iCloud Web UI rendering engine, which does not allow the user to interact with the web page. In this window, the user cannot click on buttons or interact with the page in any way. The only thing the user can do is close the window. By design, the iCloud Web UI rendering engine is isolated from the main Safari engine. This is important for security because it allows the user to have control over the actions that are performed in a web browser. It prevents any potential malicious code from interacting with the system. When the user clicks the \"View Files\" button, the new window opens up and it is rendered by Safari, which means that it is rendered by the WebKit engine. The iCloud Web UI rendering engine is only used for the original window. This is the main issue that the iCloud vulnerability exploits. Once the user clicks on the \"View Files\" button, the new window opens up and it is rendered by Safari, which means that it is rendered by the WebKit engine. The iCloud Web UI rendering engine is only used for the original window. Safari loads the new window as a child of the original window, so they both have the same URL. When the user closes the child window, the original window is also closed. Since the original window is rendered using the iCloud Web UI rendering engine, it is isolated from the main Safari engine. This means that it cannot perform actions like closing the window. When the user closes the child window, the original window is also closed. Since the original window is rendered using the iCloud Web UI rendering engine, it is isolated from the main Safari engine. This means that it cannot perform actions like closing the window. However, if the user clicks \"View Files\" on the original window, it will trigger a new window to open. This time, the new window will open up in the iCloud Web UI rendering engine. So the process is as follows: Click \"View Files\" on the original window, which opens a new window in the iCloud Web UI rendering engine. Click \"View Files\" on the new window, which opens a new window in the WebKit engine. Click \"Close\" on the new WebKit window, which closes both windows. This is the loophole that the iCloud vulnerability exploits. It allows an attacker to cause the original window to close by opening and closing the window multiple times. This is the loophole that the iCloud vulnerability exploits. It allows an attacker to cause the original window to close by opening and closing the window multiple times. The attacker could place a malicious script in the file list page that causes the window to open and close repeatedly. In order to test this vulnerability, I created a webpage that would automatically open and close the window 10 times. This is an extremely basic implementation of the exploit that would not be used in the real world. In a real attack, the script would be placed on a website that the user would have to visit in order to trigger the exploit. I then opened the file list page in Safari, and I clicked on the \"View Files\" button. After 30 seconds, the original window closed.

This could be useful information for the restaurant, but it could also be used for social networking. The company envisions a scenario in which a person uses the machine to order a drink and then the information is broadcast to other people in the area who have opted in to the service. This could allow people to see who else is in the bar and to invite others to join them. The machine is currently in beta-testing, and Cana is planning to bring it to market in 2010.

This article is an introduction to learning COmmon Business Oriented Language (COBOL). COBOL is a domain-specific language for business. It excels in managing and manipulating heterogeneous data in record structures, and its strength lies in the management of business data with validation rules. One of the advantages of COBOL is that it is still in use on a variety of platforms today. It was originally developed in 1959 and has been around for over fifty years. The latest version of COBOL is called COBOL 2002. COBOL programs compiled with this version of COBOL can be executed on a variety of platforms. COBOL is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was originally designed by Grace Hopper for the US Department of Defense for data processing. The acronym COBOL stands for COmmon Business Oriented Language. In other words, it is a language that is used to perform business-related tasks. COBOL programs are compiled and run on a variety of platforms. COBOL has been around for over 50 years, and there are still companies today that use COBOL. The current version of COBOL is version 2002. If you want to learn more about COBOL, you may want to read the COBOL Language Reference Manual. Programs written in COBOL are portable and can be compiled to run on many different platforms. Some of the most popular platforms for COBOL are the following. COBOL was designed to manage large amounts of data. Most data processing tasks have to do with the management of information that changes over time. A payroll system is an excellent example. Each week, an employee's pay rate, deductions, and hours worked change, but the employee's personal data does not change very often. In a payroll system, each employee is represented by a record. The data about that employee, including pay rate, deductions, and hours worked, is stored in fields within the record. These fields are called components, and they are stored in a record structure. Record structures are the most basic data structure in COBOL. The Record clause is used to define the record structure that will be used to store and retrieve data. The Record clause may also contain PICture specifications. The Record clause is usually placed at the top of a program, and it is called a specification. The specification is used to define the record structure for the program. The data contained in record structures is stored in fields. Each field is defined by a field name and a data type. In COBOL, data types can be character, numeric, or alphanumeric. Each data type is given a name. These names are known as PICTure specifications. The PICTure specifications define the format of the data in the fields of the record structure. The following table lists the PICTure specifications that are available in COBOL. Each of the PICTure specifications listed above has specific rules for its use. Some of these rules are given in the following table. The PICture specifications allow you to define how data is to be stored in fields. The record structure is the data structure that is used to store information about the record.

{"original_text": "Scientists from the University of Southern California were able to visualize memories forming in the brains of genetically modified zebrafish in the lab. The team expected the brains to form a memory of the environment, but what they discovered was that the neurons created a memory of the water itself, not the environment. The team modified the genetics of the fish in order to produce a protein which is triggered by water that contains a certain chemical in it. When the fish swam through water that had that chemical in it, the protein would glow in the fish's neurons, and the fish could then be observed. This study was able to help researchers understand how fish are able to remember things, but it also gives them insight into how the human brain forms memories. The scientists found that the glowing protein in the fish's neurons was not spread out evenly. Instead, it tended to be in clumps. This is a finding that was surprising to the scientists, because it was previously believed that memories were formed evenly across the neuron. While the study was only done on fish, the scientists are very excited about the potential of their findings. They believe that they may have discovered a new area of the brain that is used to form memories. In the future, scientists will be able to focus on this new area of the brain to help develop new treatments for disorders like Alzheimer's, which cause problems with memory.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "A new study has shown that fish can form memories by swimming through water that contains a chemical that glows in the neurons that control the brain's memory."}

{"original_text": "Scientists have determined that mantis shrimp will fight longer and harder for burrows of ideal size by pitching them against each other in a competition over preferred burrows. There were no prizes, but the competition was intense! Mantis shrimp are found in rocky reefs and shallow sandy habitats around the world. They make their homes in burrows that they dig into the sand or rock. These burrows are vital for the shrimp because they are used as a shelter against predators and to keep the temperature constant. But there is only so much of the available habitat that is suitable for burrows, so there is competition for burrow space. To find out more about this competition, scientists from the University of Bristol, UK, and St Mary's College of Maryland, USA, set up a series of competitions between mantis shrimp. They did this in the lab by positioning two shrimp in front of a piece of rock with a hole in it, which could be a potential burrow. The competition was to see which shrimp would take up residence first. If neither one did, they were pitched against each other in a repeat of the experiment. The results of the experiment revealed that a lot of time was wasted as the shrimp had to first establish who was the boss and then decide which one would move into the burrow. The mantis shrimp would fight longer and harder for a burrow of the ideal size, but not for a burrow that was either too big or too small. The researchers also found that it was more likely for the smaller shrimp to take the burrow over the larger shrimp, and that the shrimp did not always try to take the burrow. Some of the shrimp were content with just hanging around outside the burrow. This was especially so when they were paired up with a shrimp of the same size. They would rather waste time and energy fighting over a burrow than hang out and fight for nothing. The researchers also found that the competition for the ideal burrow was a better predictor of aggression than size. Mantis shrimp are known to be aggressive and have been seen biting the heads off of other mantis shrimp. It is only the larger species of mantis shrimp that have the ability to bite off the head of other shrimp. This aggressive behavior is also evident when mantis shrimp are fighting over a burrow. \"In the wild, this competition will be an important part of the ecology of mantis shrimp, in particular their reproductive strategy. Males will compete for burrows to attract females, and will be aggressive towards other males who try to take over their burrows. Females may use burrows as a way to escape the males, so there is an ongoing conflict over this valuable resource,\" concluded study co-author Dr. Steve Taylor.

{"original_text": "The Virgin Hyperloop is a transport system that features high-tech pods zooming through tunnels at speeds of up to 760 miles an hour using magnetic levitation. It is supposed to be up to 20 times faster than a plane, but also much cheaper, and safer. The Hyperloop is a unique technology that promises a new age of transportation. The Hyperloop is essentially a tube that has had almost all air removed, so that pods can travel through the tube at high speeds, levitated by magnetic fields. The pods are small capsules that can hold 28-40 passengers each. They will be able to travel at speeds of 700-800 miles an hour, with the maximum speed being 760 miles an hour. Each trip will take 15 minutes, and the Hyperloop could cost as little as 1 per passenger mile. That is compared to a plane that costs about 100 per passenger mile. The Hyperloop will also be much cheaper to build. It will only cost about 20-30 million per mile to build, compared to a high-speed rail, which costs 40-100 million per mile to build. The Hyperloop has three main components: the tube, the pod, and the propulsion system. The tube is made out of lightweight materials and will be pumped down to around 100 pascals of pressure. This means that the tube will be almost airless, and will greatly reduce air resistance. The pods will be small capsules that can hold 28-40 passengers. They will be made out of lightweight materials and will be able to travel at high speeds. The pods will also have lightweight wheels with a magnetic coating, which will enable the pods to levitate inside the Hyperloop tube. They will be powered by linear induction motors that will propel the pods to high speeds. The Hyperloop will be used for long distance travel, to take people to their destinations quickly. It will also be cheap, with tickets being cheaper than plane tickets, and much cheaper than other forms of high-speed transportation. It will also be very efficient. It will use solar panels to power it, and it will also be sustainable, because it will not pollute the environment. It will also be very safe. There will be no emissions from the Hyperloop, so it will be better for the environment. The Hyperloop will also be very safe. It will feature a system where pods will travel in both directions, so there will not be any head-on collisions. It will also be safe from any accidents such as earthquakes, because it will be built on concrete pylons. The Hyperloop is a revolutionary new transportation system that will change the world. It will change how we travel, and it will be much better than current forms of transportation. It will be fast, cheap, safe, and sustainable.

A team of researchers from Northwestern University built an ultraminiature, wireless, battery-free, and fully implantable optogenetics device for mice that allowed them to remotely control the neurons of the mouse. The research team is led by John A. Rogers, a pioneer of flexible electronics. The device is wirelessly powered by a laser diode that can be delivered through a fiber optic cable, which is attached to an external laser. The researchers explained that the external laser can be turned on and off with a computer, which allows them to remotely control the neurons. The researchers also said that the device can potentially be applied in other types of neuroscience experiments. The device has a battery-free design, which means that it does not use any electronics at all. Instead, the device is a series of thin, flexible silicon photonic chips. The chips are encased in a small biocompatible glass package, which can be implanted in a mouse. The photonic chips convert infrared light into blue light, which is then used to activate the neurons. These photonic chips are wirelessly powered by the laser. The battery-free design is a major advantage, as there are no issues with battery discharge, which could affect the experiments. According to the research team, the device could be used to activate neurons in other parts of the brain, which could make it possible to develop a fully implantable neural interface system. The researchers added that the device could be used in other studies in which the researchers would like to remotely control the neurons of the mice, which would allow for more flexibility in conducting the experiments.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Researchers have developed a device that allows them to remotely control the neurons of a mouse.

{"original_text": "A quantum effect called superabsorption allows a collection of molecules to absorb light more efficiently than if each molecule were acting individually. Researchers have used this phenomenon to create a new type of optical device that could improve the sensitivity of solar cells, cameras, and other devices. The system, described today in Nature, consists of two microscopic silicon wires arranged so that they face each other and are spaced only nanometers apart. The researchers found that when light hit one wire, it would appear to be absorbed by the other wire. The effect could be observed even if the wires were separated by a distance five times larger than the light's wavelength. The phenomenon is the result of quantum effects that cause light to \"tunnel\" through the space between the wires. When the light reaches the second wire, it appears as if it was emitted there. This is similar to the way that an electron in one quantum state can tunnel into a different quantum state - an effect that is widely used in many kinds of devices, such as the tunnel diodes used in transistor radios. The effect has been observed in the lab before, but this is the first time it has been seen in a silicon-based device. The finding may enable researchers to integrate the effect into silicon-based systems, which are important in a wide range of optical applications. It's been known for some time that when you have a system in which two resonators are very close to each other, there can be a coupling effect, called vacuum Rabi splitting, which enhances the interaction between the light and the matter. The team, led by David Kim, a postdoc in the laboratory of Xiang Zhang, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, found a new way to create the coupling effect. They turned the usual arrangement upside down by placing the resonators on top of each other, separated by a nanoscale gap. This allowed the coupling between the resonators to be much stronger than in the usual configuration. The new device could be used to enhance the efficiency of solar cells, in which the photovoltaic material absorbs only a fraction of the incident light. The material is generally chosen to absorb a particular wavelength of light, but it is ineffective at absorbing light at other wavelengths. If an optical antenna could be used to couple these \"forbidden\" wavelengths to the material, it would increase the overall efficiency of the device. The system could also be used to create an optical modulator, which could alter the amplitude, phase, or frequency of a light beam, potentially allowing a system to be used as a type of optical transistor. One application for this technology would be to speed up the data transmission in computer chips. Optical modulators have previously been made using a different type of superabsorption effect called electromagnetically induced transparency. However, these devices can only operate at very low temperatures. The new device works at room temperature, making it suitable for many applications.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "A new type of optical device that absorbs light has been created by scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)."}

This article takes a look at SVG techniques such as SVG grids, fractional SVG stars, masks, and gradients, and provides some best practices when using these techniques.

In the first part, we explored techniques for using SVGs for image replacement and as a scalable, lightweight alternative to raster images for backgrounds. In this part, we explore other useful techniques for using SVGs. One of the most common reasons for using SVGs is to represent shapes on the web. It might be a logo, icon, chart, or image of a product, or perhaps a simple shape. SVGs are perfect for representing these shapes because they can scale up and down without any loss of quality. There are many ways to do this, and we'll look at some examples in this article, including SVG grids, fractional SVG stars, masks, and gradients. Many tools exist for creating simple SVGs, like the ones mentioned above. Some of these tools even allow you to create SVGs directly within your HTML code. The free web app SVG-Edit, for example, lets you create SVGs and is ideal for experimenting with SVGs. As you can see, this simple method of generating an SVG is extremely flexible. You can use it to create many shapes, and even combine shapes with masks to create more interesting designs. The SVG file we've created has an svg element as its root element.

The best way is to use a vector graphics editor like Adobe Illustrator, which can export shapes directly to SVG. If you're more technically minded, you can define the shape using the path element and the d attribute, which defines a series of points. This is covered in detail in the SVG specification. Whatever the case, once you've defined the shape, you can use the mask element to apply it as a mask to another SVG element. The mask element contains the shape that you want to use as a mask. It also defines how the mask should be applied, via the maskUnits attribute. In this example, we've used maskUnits\"objectBoundingBox.\" This tells the browser to apply the mask to the entire object. The mask element has two child elements, rect and path. The rect element defines the dimensions of the object that the mask is applied to. The path element defines the shape of the mask.

{"original_text": "At the beginning of the year, OpenAI released the model-weights and code for CLIP, a model trained to determine which caption from a set of captions best fits a given image. The CLIP model was trained on 400 million image-caption pairs, so it is not surprising that it can accurately predict the correct caption in these image-caption pairs. However, the researchers behind CLIP also found that their model could accurately determine the correct caption for images where it had never seen the caption before. Using a technique they call prompting, they were able to generate a caption for any given image, and then test the CLIP model on that image to determine if the generated caption was correct. In this post, we'll train our own CLIP model to test image-caption pairs. We'll then use the model to generate captions for images that it has never seen before, and then test the generated caption to see if it is correct. The CLIP model The CLIP model is a vision-language pretrained transformer that can map an image to a set of captions. The model has two inputs, an image and a set of captions. The image is transformed to a 1414 pixel matrix that is then passed through the first layer of the model. Similarly, the set of captions are passed through the first layer of the model. The last layer of the model outputs a vector representation of the image and the captions. The CLIP model then takes the dot product of the image representation and the set of caption representations. The caption that has the highest dot product is determined to be the best caption for the image. The model is trained on pairs of image and caption embeddings, and has a mechanism to align the embeddings of the image and the caption. The model is trained to minimize the following loss function: where is the dot product of the caption embedding and the image embedding. The CLIP model was trained on 400 million image-caption pairs from the Conceptual Captions Dataset. The model consists of a visual encoder, a text encoder, and a set of layers that align the embeddings from the visual encoder with the embeddings from the text encoder. The visual encoder is a ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet. The text encoder is a Transformer encoder. The model is trained using the following loss function: The encoders are trained to minimize the first term in the loss function. The alignment module is trained to minimize the second term in the loss function. The CLIP model is an encoder-decoder transformer architecture. The encoders take an image and a set of captions as input. The decoder takes an image as input, and generates a set of captions as output. The model has the following architecture: The model takes a 224224 pixel image as input and outputs a 2048 dimensional vector representation of the image. Similarly, the model takes a 50-word caption as input and outputs a 2048 dimensional vector representation of the caption. We'll train the CLIP model on 400 million image-caption pairs. The pretrained model weights and code is available from OpenAI. We can download the pretrained model and use it to predict captions for images. In order to generate captions for images, we'll take an image as input to the decoder. We'll then train the CLIP model to predict the correct caption for the input image. The CLIP model has the following architecture: In the input layer, each word is encoded as a 768-dimensional vector. The input vectors are passed through a positional encoding layer and a feed-forward Transformer layer to produce an embedding vector for each word. The captions are then passed through a second Transformer layer to produce a 128-dimensional embedding for the caption. The image is first encoded by a pretrained ResNet-50 network to produce a 2048-dimensional embedding for the image. The embedding for the image is then passed through a set of three Transformer layers to produce a 128-dimensional embedding for the image. We can plot the output of the three transformer layers to see how the embedding for the image is transformed. The CLIP model has an alignment module that produces a 128-dimensional embedding for the image-caption pair.

The CLIP model was trained on 400 million image-caption pairs, so it is not surprising that it can accurately predict the correct caption in these image-caption pairs. However, the researchers behind CLIP also found that their model could accurately determine the correct caption for images where it had never seen the caption before. Using a technique they call prompting, they were able to generate a caption for any given image, and then test the CLIP model on that image to determine if the generated caption was correct. In this post, we'll train our own CLIP model to test image-caption pairs. We'll then use the model to generate captions for images that it has never seen before, and then test the generated caption to see if it is correct. The CLIP model The CLIP model is a vision-language pretrained transformer that can map an image to a set of captions. The model has two inputs, an image and a set of captions. The image is transformed to a 1414 pixel matrix that is then passed through the first layer of the model. Similarly, the set of captions are passed through the first layer of the model. The last layer of the model outputs a vector representation of the image and the captions. The CLIP model then takes the dot product of the image representation and the set of caption representations. The caption that has the highest dot product is determined to be the best caption for the image. The model is trained on pairs of image and caption embeddings, and has a mechanism to align the embeddings of the image and the caption.

In addition to the standard features of requests, HTTPX has sessions with advanced caching, cookies, and middleware. HTTPX is inspired by the Node.js HTTP client package 'axios', which has been popular with developers for its excellent API. HTTPX is an API-compatible drop-in replacement for requests, making it easy to migrate to HTTPX from requests. HTTPX is built on top of the requests module, so it has the same features as requests, such as supporting cookies, keep-alive, and streaming. HTTPX offers advanced features such as sessions, caching, and middleware. Sessions allow for easier state management of connections and cookies. Caching supports caching of HTTP response bodies, headers, and cookies. Middleware allows you to add additional functionality to an HTTP request, such as logging. HTTPX is intended to be an API-compatible drop-in replacement for requests. Simply import httpx instead of requests. For the majority of applications, this is all that is required. If you have a small number of requests that you would like to cache, you can use the cache decorator. For more information on the cache decorator, see the Cache Decorator Documentation.

{"original_text": "The Human Pangenome Project aims to gather, organize, and make accessible a representation of all genetic diversity found in people. The data could help reveal information about genetic risk for diseases, as well as the underlying biology of disease. On February 10, the research team launched a call for samples to be sequenced as part of the project. The launch coincided with a special issue of Genome Medicine, featuring articles that report the preliminary results of the first 350 genomes sequenced as part of the project. In the near future, when all genes are sequenced, the availability of this data will improve clinical decision making, and we will be able to tailor treatments to the genetic makeup of each patient. Dr. Stephen Scherer The study's investigators sequenced more than 350 people from around the world, including the Inuit people of Nunavut, northern Canada, and southern Africa, the Middle East, the Americas, and the Pacific Islands. The genomes were analyzed to determine the frequency of genetic variants among different populations. The data have revealed previously unknown DNA changes that may be associated with a risk of certain diseases. In the special issue, Scherer and his colleagues reported that the genetic code of Inuit people from Nunavut has a much higher number of differences in genetic code than in other populations. They also found that people from the Americas have a higher frequency of genetic variants that are linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Other findings in the special issue include: The first complete genome sequences from people of African ancestry. The researchers found that the African genomes had a higher number of small differences in their genetic code than the genomes from people of European ancestry. The African genomes also had higher numbers of genetic variants associated with a risk of Alzheimer's disease. The first genome sequence from an individual from Oceania. The researchers found that the individual carried a genetic variation that is associated with a higher risk of asthma and a lower risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A genome sequence from an individual from the Middle East. The researchers identified a genetic variant associated with a lower risk of Parkinson's disease. The Human Pangenome Project is part of the Ontario Health Study, a long-term project by the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR). Scherer is the Director of OICR's Genome Informatics Program and Senior Core Scientist at SickKids' Research Institute. The Human Pangenome Project will be one of the largest genomic sequencing initiatives to date, and will generate data that will advance our knowledge of disease and help guide clinical practice. The project will also be a significant contribution to the study of human history and migration.

The game is currently in Alpha stage. Retrieved from \""}
{"original_text": "Apple's HomePod mini smart speaker has a secret temperature and humidity sensor in its casing. It isn't currently usable by owners of the device yet, but Apple has previously included temperature and humidity sensors in its iPhones. The fact that the HomePod has a temperature and humidity sensor has been confirmed on Reddit by a user who says that they checked the software source code for the device. This sensor is not currently active on the HomePod, which is a bit like the current situation with the iPhone's sensors. Though they've been there since 2011, they haven't been activated for public use yet. The HomePod has a range of built-in sensors including an accelerometer, a microphone array, and a beam-forming tweeter. We know that the microphone array helps to enable the speaker's spatial awareness, and the accelerometer is used to detect when you're interacting with the speaker by tapping on it. The inclusion of a temperature and humidity sensor means that the HomePod could, in the future, be used to help you monitor the temperature and humidity of a room. As for why Apple included it in the first place, that remains unclear. It's possible that it's for internal testing, or it may be there to give Apple the option of activating it in a future software update. The HomePod is available now, and is Apple's first major smart speaker. In addition to Apple's own built-in features, it's also compatible with smart home platforms such as HomeKit and Apple's own Home app. This week on AI: HomePod reviews, rumors of iPhone SE 2, and more", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Apple's HomePod has a temperature and humidity sensor in its casing, which could be used to monitor the temperature and Humidity in a room, according to a Reddit user."}

{"original_text": "Researchers at Stanford University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have discovered a way to transform a substance found in fossil fuels into diamonds with pressure and low heat. Diamond-like carbon can be used in high-tech applications such as solar cells and computer chips, and diamonds can be used for industrial applications, such as cutting tools, and for jewelry and investment. The new method is the first time researchers have been able to make diamonds and diamond-like carbon at room temperature. The diamond-producing substance is called benzene, which is commonly found in crude oil and natural gas. This method will allow more companies to produce diamonds in a cost-effective way. The diamonds are only a few microns in size, and can be made on an industrial scale. This process would allow diamond producers to create more diamonds, which may lower the prices of diamonds. The process begins with benzene, which is a colorless or light yellow liquid. The scientists put the benzene into a tiny capsule that is about the size of a computer chip. They then put the capsule into a press, which applies pressure to the capsule. The pressure forces the benzene molecules to change into a new substance called graphite. The graphite then forms into diamonds. The researchers are using this process to create diamond-like carbon, which can be used in computer chips and solar cells. The diamond-like carbon is very strong and durable, and will not break down over time. The researchers are currently looking for ways to make larger diamonds.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Scientists have come up with a new way to make diamonds, which could lower the prices of the precious stone and increase the use of carbon in high-tech applications."}

{"original_text": "A developer has created a way to scale macOS using docker. Each instance is able to access services like iMessage as Docker-OSX generates unique codes for its macOS hardware. The app also needs a valid Apple Developer ID to function. Docker-OSX has been on Github for a while now but has only just been picked up by the Apple news grapevine. Docker-OSX is a docker container engine for MacOSX. It runs on top of OSX and allows to run multiple instances of OSX side by side. It's also able to run VMWare Fusion VM's, so it is possible to run all versions of OSX side by side, all at the same time. The goal of the project is to make it easy for software developers to test their applications on multiple versions of OSX. If you're wondering why on earth you would want to run multiple versions of macOS simultaneously, then it's likely that this app is not for you. Developers will likely find this to be incredibly useful as it allows them to see how apps perform across different versions of the Mac operating system. This is similar to what Android developers can do with the help of Android Emulators, but for Macs. It also allows developers to see how different versions of macOS perform in the real world. Docker-OSX runs in the background, and its main purpose is to generate unique codes for its instances of macOS. This means that it can run macOS in a sandbox environment without having to install multiple versions of the OS on a physical Mac. Each macOS instance can connect to the internet, and developers can test apps and see how they perform with the help of Docker-OSX. Docker-OSX is also fully compatible with iMessage, which means that developers can test the iMessage app on different versions of macOS simultaneously. Docker-OSX is available for free on Github, and all the details are available here. There are no tutorials available yet, but the developer says that there will be soon. Are you a developer?

Backchannel is not available to all users yet, but if you're part of the beta, you may have a chance to test it. The feature was accidentally leaked to users, who reported it on social media. After a brief period, Clubhouse made the feature available to a wider range of users and kept it running for a few days. Backchannel is described as a way to chat with the user you're listening to. This functionality is already possible in a few ways. First, you can message with the user from your mobile device and your message will appear in the Clubhouse app. Or, you can use the callout function in the app to communicate. Backchannel may have some unique benefits that have not been described yet. Clubhouse is a messaging platform that works on iOS and Android. The app uses technology from Amazon to provide a hands-free audio messaging experience. Clubhouse has become popular in the business world, but the app is also used by family and friends to communicate with each other. Clubhouse also has some interesting features like the ability to leave notes, which are short messages that can be heard by other users in the conversation. Backchannel is not available to everyone yet, but if you have the Clubhouse beta installed on your device, you may have a chance to test it out. Open the Clubhouse app and go to your profile, then tap on your initials in the upper left corner. Scroll down and you'll see a switch that says \"Backchannel Beta.\" Tap on that switch and you'll be able to use the feature. If you don't have the beta version of the app installed, go to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store and search for Clubhouse Beta. Click on the link and tap \"Get,\" then \"Accept,\" and install the app. When you open Clubhouse Beta, you'll be asked to sign up. Once you're registered, you'll be able to join Backchannel. If you can't access Backchannel for some reason, keep in mind that Clubhouse has not released the feature yet, and the release date is unknown. It is also unknown how many users will be allowed to use Backchannel when it's released. Backchannel is a new feature that will likely be used by Clubhouse's business customers. Companies can communicate with employees over audio, but they'll also be able to communicate via text. For example, if you're working with someone on a project, you may want to send them a link to a file or website. Clubhouse is a messaging app that is used for audio messages, but with Backchannel, you can send links, images, and other types of messages. Backchannel could make Clubhouse even more useful for businesses. It's also possible that Clubhouse will use Backchannel to enhance the app's features. Backchannel might be able to provide users with a way to send and receive important notifications or messages. Clubhouse also has a note feature that allows users to leave audio messages. Backchannel could provide users with the ability to leave notes. Clubhouse is an app with a unique audio messaging feature, and Backchannel could enhance that experience.

{"original_text": "Solid is a new decentralized internet designed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who is credited with inventing the original internet. As far as I can tell (I am very dumb, so please correct me if I am wrong) it will be a browser that allows access to websites that are not hosted on servers, but on the computers of the people who run the sites. For more information, you can watch a short video he made here. The reason I bring this up is because a lot of people in the anime community have been talking about the idea of a decentralized internet for a while. It came up most recently in the show I co-host, the Anime Nostalgia Podcast, in our most recent episode about the controversy regarding the creation of \"Anime Streaming.\" The premise of Anime Streaming is that it will be a website that will allow people to upload anime so that people can stream it and then the website will pay the people who upload the anime. I personally think this is a terrible idea. I think it will be shut down almost immediately by Japanese copyright holders because they have a lot of influence and power and they have been very aggressive about shutting down sites that host anime illegally. In addition, I think that sites like this have the potential to lead to the breakdown of the industry because the pay that the site will give to uploaders will be so low that they will never be able to stop uploading, and therefore they will never have to go out and buy new shows. The other problem is that these sites will have access to all the information of the people who use the site and could give it away to third parties. This is a huge problem because a lot of the shows on these sites are not exactly popular in the United States and even if you are watching something that is available legally you might not want people to know about it because it is embarrassing (especially if you are a teenager). I don't think that Anime Streaming is going to be the first site to be shut down by Japanese companies. I think that they will first go after the fansub sites. Fansub sites host anime that are not licensed in English and then they upload them to the internet so that people can watch them. I think that they will go after them first because I think that Japanese companies will feel that people watching unlicensed fansubs are more of a threat to their profits than people uploading shows to Anime Streaming because fansubs are not only stealing the shows from the companies, but they are also translating them so that people can watch them. Anime Streaming, on the other hand, is just a website that is hosting shows, which is not really any different from Netflix or Crunchyroll. The only difference is that the site will be uploading the shows instead of licensing them, but there are people who already do this. I think that people will still buy anime if it is not available to stream, even if they have to wait for a couple of weeks or months. I think that people will go to these sites and use them to stream anime that is available legally and then buy shows that they can't stream. I think that the solution to this problem is the creation of a decentralized internet like the one that Sir Tim Berners-Lee is working on. I think that people who are really passionate about anime will create their own sites and that the sites will be hosted on the computers of people all around the world. I don't think that Japanese companies will have the same amount of power to shut down these sites as they do with Anime Streaming because the site will be decentralized and there will be no one server that they can shut down, and I think that they won't be able to get people to stop uploading shows to them because there will be no one that they can shut down or get money from. I think that if people create their own decentralized sites then they will be able to have the shows that they want and people who are interested in anime will be able to find it and see it and that anime will be able to have the global audience that it deserves. anime, decentralized internet, internet, tim berners-lee 2 thoughts on \"A Decentralized Internet for Anime\" We need to stop putting money into the hands of Japanese companies if we want this to happen. If people stop paying for anime then they will no longer be able to afford to shut down the websites that host unlicensed content. I hope that the industry collapses and that the manga and anime markets are taken over by people who don't charge for the content.

India joins the exclusive club of the US, Russia and China to have a proven record of destroying satellites with weapons in space. India's move to test the anti-satellite weapon is also a warning to Pakistan, which had earlier suggested that it would develop weapons in space as well. India's first Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Missile test has created a new dimension in the world's fight against space weaponization. The ASAT Missile was developed with the support of ISRO and DRDO. The missile was launched from the Odisha coast and destroyed the targeted satellite within three minutes of the launch. The satellite was a low orbit satellite, which is why it broke into pieces, which will de-orbit and fall back on earth within 45 days. The ASAT Missile has given India an added advantage over China, which has been developing weapons and sensors in space for several years now. The ASAT Missile launch was initially planned to be done in February, but was postponed to Wednesday.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "India has become the first country in the world to destroy a satellite with a missile in space, the country's defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said."}

{"original_text": "Java attempts to run trusted and untrusted code within the same virtual machine, with the only thing separating them being the permission system and visibility modifiers. A bug anywhere in the JVM implementation or in any of the code running in the JVM could lead to a security flaw that could allow an attacker to bypass the permission system. The problem is even worse when considering the use of scripting languages that use the JVM (such as Groovy and JRuby), because there is no way to ensure that all the code that gets executed was written in the language and not in Java. For example, you could execute a Groovy script containing a Java class that does something dangerous. Granted, this isn't a theoretical problem - Java's record for security is pretty good so far. Still, there's no such thing as perfect security, and having to worry about how to prevent one bug in the code that you can't see from taking down your whole program is a significant concern. Sun has been working on a solution to this problem for a while. It's called the Java Secure Execution (JSE) system. It's still in the early stages of development, but here's how it works: The current JVM is split into two pieces, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the Java Secure Virtual Machine (JSVM). The JVM is what we know and love today, running all the Java bytecode in the program. The JVM is cut off from the operating system, and the only communication it has with it is via the JVM to JSVM bridge. The JSVM runs under a trusted operating system layer called the Java Security Kernel (JSK). The JSK is responsible for managing all the JSSE infrastructure, including the JSVM. The JSK manages the permissions of the JVM and all other JSSE components. A JSSE application has one JVM that runs the core application and, optionally, a second JVM that runs all the untrusted code. The untrusted code is run in the JSVM, and the JSVM acts as a bridge between the untrusted code and the operating system. Both JVMs are run under the JSK. The JSK can tell which parts of the JVM or JSVM have been compromised and shut them down, or at least limit their access to the operating system. When running a Java application, the JVM that runs the trusted code has a higher level of privilege than the JVM that runs the untrusted code, so it can always override any request made by the untrusted code. The JSK and JSVM are responsible for managing all aspects of security, including permissions, communication with the operating system, and resource allocation. The JSK is trusted to behave properly, and it can grant or deny access to resources. The JSVM is run under the JSK and doesn't have direct access to the operating system or other resources. The JSSE system gives the untrusted code as little access to the operating system as possible. The JSK monitors the JSVM for bugs or security flaws. If a problem is found, the JSK can shut down the JSVM or restrict its access to the operating system. The JSK is a trusted program and runs under the JSVM. The JSK runs under an operating system with a trusted, secure kernel that can verify the JSK's integrity and protect it from tampering. There is a chain of trust from the operating system through the JSK to the JVM. You might think that using the JSK adds yet another layer of complexity and makes it more difficult to find security bugs. The good news is that the JSK is written in Java, and it's more likely that a Java security bug will be found by the millions of Java developers worldwide than by a small number of kernel developers. The JSK isn't exactly a perfect solution, but it's the best one Sun has found so far. There's still a lot of work to be done before it's ready for use in the real world. It will probably be a few more years before the JSE is used in a production environment. For now, you'll have to make do with the current JVM and hope it doesn't have any security holes.

{"original_text": "Neuromorphic computing hardware is special hardware developed to model the behavior of biological neurons. A group of researchers from the US have developed a non-silicon version of the hardware that could be used to investigate how neurons communicate with each other. The researchers used a polymer material called P (VDF-TrFE-CFE) that has piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties. The combination of these two properties allows the material to exhibit some of the behavior that biological neurons are capable of, including synaptic plasticity, synaptic transmission, and short-term memory. In general, neurons communicate with each other through electrochemical signals. The signals are generated by voltage changes that occur when the neuron is stimulated by an external signal or by the activation of another neuron. The neuron generates an action potential that is transmitted to other neurons via synaptic connections. The synaptic connection consists of a small gap between the neuron and the target cell across which the electrical signal is transmitted. The synapse is similar to a capacitor in an electrical circuit. As the neuron sends the signal, the electric field generated at the synapse changes and can cause the polarization of the molecules within the synaptic junction. The molecules are then able to hold the polarization, thus forming a short-term memory of the signal. The polarized molecules can also be re-polarized by the reverse action potential of the next neuron. A neuron is a nerve cell that is the basic building block of the nervous system. Neurons are similar to other cells in the human body in that they have a cell membrane, a cytoplasm, and organelles. Neurons differ from other cells in that they generate and propagate electrochemical signals. A neuron consists of a cell body called the soma, and long fibers called dendrites and axons that project from the soma and extend to other neurons or muscles. A neuron uses the dendrites to receive signals from other neurons. The neuron integrates the signals it receives and generates an output signal that is sent to the axons. The axons send the signal to other neurons or muscles. The cell body contains the nucleus, which controls the cell metabolism and growth. The dendrites and axons have a sheath of myelin, which is a fatty substance that helps speed up the signal transmission along the axon. The sheath is interrupted at regular intervals to form gaps called Nodes of Ranvier. The sheath does not extend into the axon terminals. At the end of the axon, the signal is transmitted to another neuron through a synapse. A synapse is a gap between two neurons that is bridged by a neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitter is a chemical that is released by one neuron and received by another. The neurotransmitter transmits the electrical signal from the first neuron to the next one. A neuron is triggered by a signal that is generated by an external stimulus or by another neuron. The triggering signal is transmitted from the dendrites to the axon via the cell body and can travel as far as the axon terminal. At the axon terminal, the signal causes the opening of ion channels that allow ions to flow into and out of the neuron. The change in ion concentration generates an electric potential across the neuron membrane. The change in the electric potential travels down the axon as an action potential. The action potential is a change in the electric potential of the neuron that travels down the length of the axon. The action potential is generated when an ion channel opens and allows ions to flow into or out of the neuron. The ions flow into or out of the neuron through the ion channels in response to an external stimulus or a signal from another neuron. The action potential travels along the axon at about 120 meters per second and can travel as far as the axon terminal. When the action potential reaches the axon terminal, the action potential causes the release of neurotransmitters from vesicles. The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and attach to receptors on the receiving cell. The neurotransmitter changes the electrical potential of the receiving cell and generates another action potential that travels along the axon of the receiving neuron. The release of neurotransmitters and the generation of the action potential that travels down the axon of the receiving neuron is referred to as synaptic transmission.

{"original_text": "Metamaterials are materials made up of components that combine to create properties that are relatively independent of the properties of the original materials. Metasurfaces are flat structures that can manipulate the behavior of waves across a range of frequencies. Metasurfaces have been fabricated with various techniques and have been found to be useful in applications ranging from microwaves to optics, and from sensors to displays. Allen, et al., describe a fabrication process for metasurfaces made of 3D nanostructures. These metasurfaces can be used to manipulate the reflectance of waves in a broad frequency range. The metasurfaces can be used for free-space optical communication and applications that involve the manipulation of light. The metasurfaces were fabricated with a nanofabrication process that uses a combination of electron beam lithography and focused ion beam milling. The lithographic process was used to pattern the features of the metasurface into a thin layer of poly (methyl methacrylate). The milling process was used to remove material from the patterned features, leaving the 3D nanostructure. The metasurfaces were made up of nanowires. These metasurfaces were tested with broadband infrared and optical light, which were used to induce interactions with the metasurface. The nanowires were made of silicon and had a radius of 100 nm. The wires were spaced 200 nm apart. The wires were spaced at different distances to explore the differences in performance. The metasurfaces were fabricated with a variety of nanowire geometries. The metasurfaces were made with straight nanowires, curved nanowires, and nanowires with an S-shaped cross-section. The different geometries enabled the nanowires to be used in different ways. The metasurfaces were fabricated with a geometry that was designed to provide total reflectance. The total reflectance was achieved using the nanowires to create a structure that was similar to a Fabry-Perot resonator. The structure reflected infrared light at 10.5 m. The metasurface was fabricated with a design that was intended to create a Bragg diffraction grating that could reflect infrared light. The design was based on a series of nanowires that were spaced at intervals of 1 m. The metasurface was able to reflect infrared light at 10.5 m. The metasurface was fabricated with a design that was intended to provide a transmission window at a specific wavelength. The metasurface was fabricated with a spacing of 1 m between the nanowires. This spacing resulted in a transmission peak at 10.5 m. The metasurface was fabricated with a design that was intended to provide a transmission window at a specific wavelength. The metasurface was fabricated with a spacing of 10 m between the nanowires. This spacing resulted in a transmission peak at 8 m. The metasurface was fabricated with a design that was intended to provide a transmission window at a specific wavelength. The metasurface was fabricated with a spacing of 30 m between the nanowires.

Metasurfaces are flat structures that can manipulate the behavior of waves across a range of frequencies. Metasurfaces have been fabricated with various techniques and have been found to be useful in applications ranging from microwaves to optics, and from sensors to displays. Allen, et al., describe a fabrication process for metasurfaces made of 3D nanostructures. These metasurfaces can be used to manipulate the reflectance of waves in a broad frequency range. The metasurfaces can be used for free-space optical communication and applications that involve the manipulation of light. The metasurfaces were fabricated with a nanofabrication process that uses a combination of electron beam lithography and focused ion beam milling. The lithographic process was used to pattern the features of the metasurface into a thin layer of poly (methyl methacrylate). The milling process was used to remove material from the patterned features, leaving the 3D nanostructure. The metasurfaces were made up of nanowires. These metasurfaces were tested with broadband infrared and optical light, which were used to induce interactions with the metasurface. The nanowires were made of silicon and had a radius of 100 nm. The wires were spaced 200 nm apart. The wires were spaced at different distances to explore the differences in performance. The metasurfaces were fabricated with a variety of nanowire geometries. The metasurfaces were made with straight nanowires, curved nanowires, and nanowires with an S-shaped cross-section. The different geometries enabled the nanowires to be used in different ways. The metasurfaces were fabricated with a geometry that was designed to provide total reflectance. The total reflectance was achieved using the nanowires to create a structure that was similar to a Fabry-Perot resonator. The structure reflected infrared light at 10.5 m. The metasurface was fabricated with a design that was intended to create a Bragg diffraction grating that could reflect infrared light. The design was based on a series of nanowires that were spaced at intervals of 1 m. The metasurface was able to reflect infrared light at 10.5 m.

Trees can recapture carbon, but first, they need water. Wong's company, Elementa, uses solar powered technology to desalinate and purify seawater and pump it to the roots of the trees, creating a healthy ecosystem where trees can grow. This technology could help create 100,000 acres of forest on 200,000 acres of land, turning the desert into an oasis of carbon-capturing forest. We are thrilled to announce our latest investment, Elementa, which will create forests in the desert and capture carbon from the atmosphere.

We are thrilled to announce our latest investment, Elementa, which will create forests in the desert and capture carbon from the atmosphere. Elementa is the second company in our Carbontech Fund and we are also proud to be the lead investor in this round. Elementa has developed technology to desalinate and purify seawater and pump it to the roots of trees, creating a healthy ecosystem where trees can grow. Trees are one of the most efficient ways to capture carbon, but in order to grow, trees need a lot of water. Water is one of the most precious resources in the world, so we need to be able to use it effectively and efficiently. Elementa's technology is solar-powered and uses less energy than comparable desalination methods. With Elementa's technology, we can turn a desert into a forest. Forests can also play a role in protecting biodiversity. Elementa's technology allows forests to grow in areas that are not currently suitable for trees. For example, in the Atacama desert in Chile, which is the driest desert in the world, Elementa is working with the National Forestry Corporation of Chile to create forests in the desert. These forests can help protect biodiversity because they will be home to thousands of native plants and animals, including the Atacama chinchilla, a critically endangered species of rodent that is the only mammal in the Atacama. Elementa is a pioneer in using technology to capture carbon from the atmosphere and use it to create healthy ecosystems. They are using carbontech to restore nature, and we are proud to support them.

{"original_text": "NASA scientists discovered cyclopropenylidene in the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan. The simple, carbon-based molecule has never been seen in an atmosphere before. Titan has long been considered one of the most Earthlike places in our solar system, and has been theorized to be similar to our planet during its early days. The Cassini spacecraft, which orbits Saturn and has been sending back data since 2004, found that the simple hydrocarbon is a chemical precursor to life. \"This molecule existed on the primordial Earth,\" said Martin Cordiner, an astrochemist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. \"This tells us that complex organic chemistry can happen in alien environments, and that the building blocks of life are everywhere in the universe.\" Cyclopropenylidene is a simple molecule containing carbon and hydrogen atoms, and it's surprisingly common in the universe. It's produced in chemical reactions in laboratories on Earth, and exists in carbon-rich environments like meteorites and the atmosphere of Titan. The Cassini spacecraft, which was launched in 1997, has been studying Saturn's moons since 2004. Scientists first discovered methane in Titan's atmosphere during a flyby in 2004, and suspected that complex organic chemistry existed on the moon. But until now, the instruments on the spacecraft weren't sensitive enough to pick up the signal from cyclopropenylidene. The data showed that the molecule's abundance is comparable to methane's. The scientists believe that the molecule is formed when sunlight interacts with methane and other molecules in Titan's atmosphere. This causes the carbon-hydrogen bonds to break, allowing the molecule to form. \"We are very confident in our findings because we were able to detect the molecule multiple times at various altitudes,\" said Conor Nixon, a planetary scientist at NASA Goddard and lead author of a paper on the discovery published in Science Advances. \"We are now bringing together all of the data we collected in order to create a detailed picture of the chemistry of Titan's atmosphere.\" This discovery, along with others, suggests that Titan's atmosphere is a chemical factory, and has a complex network of reactions similar to Earth's. \"We can't say for certain what forms of life may exist in Titan's methane-rich lakes and seas, but this new information will provide valuable insight into chemical processes occurring in the environment of this intriguing moon,\" said Scott Edgington, Cassini deputy project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

{"original_text": "Python autocomplete is a project that experiments with using an LSTM model to autocomplete python code. Test results show that it can save users between 30 to 50 percent of their typing. Aside from saving time, this also improves accuracy and reduces frustration from misspellings. This article will show you how to setup and train a basic LSTM autocomplete model, and how to use it to autocomplete Python code. This article assumes you have some basic Python knowledge, but you can get started without a strong background in machine learning. This article will use the Keras library with the TensorFlow backend to train our model. In order to use these, you will need to install the TensorFlow and Keras libraries for your platform. Start by installing pip. For Ubuntu, this is a package available in the software repositories. After installing pip, you can install Keras and TensorFlow for Python 2.7, or 3.5 and above. Since we are working with LSTMs, it would be a good idea to install the Theano backend. The final step is to install the Theano library. This should be installed with pip. This will be a quick overview of how to use the TensorFlow and Keras libraries to train a model. Let's start by importing the libraries we will need. TensorFlow will automatically download all of the files required to run the model. Once the download completes, we can load the model. This will print out the number of images, and the number of classes. The model will return a list of 10 values, which are the probabilities of the 10 possible characters. The result is stored in a variable named probabilities. Probability distributions are by definition normalized to sum to one. This means the sum of all probabilities should equal one. However, this does not mean that all probabilities are equal. For example, if the model is predicting the letter \"q\" with a probability of 0.95 and the letter \"w\" with a probability of 0.05, it is more likely to predict \"q\" than \"w.\" The probability of \"q\" can be found by summing all of the probabilities above it. However, the probability of the letter \"w\" can be found by summing all of the probabilities below it. These methods can be used to find the probabilities for all of the characters. This will result in a list of probabilities for each character. Since we know that the sum of all probabilities is one, the sum of all probabilities in the list should be one. In order to use the autocomplete, we will need to make an HTML file that will allow us to type into a textbox and display the results. This will create an index.html file in the current directory. This will display the Python code in the box below the text box. The first line will open a web server on port 8000. The second line will load the index.html file. We will need to import the libraries we used to create the autocomplete model. This will create a variable named model. This variable will contain the model we created earlier. We will also need to import the dataset that we are using. The next step will create a function that will use our model to autocomplete the code. This function will take a character and use the model to find the probabilities for all of the characters. It will then search for the character with the highest probability. If the probability is above a threshold value, it will append that character to the text string. If the probability is below a threshold value, it will append the character to the list of suggestions. The next step will use the function we created to autocomplete the text. This will use the autocomplete function to append a character to the list of suggestions when the probability is below the threshold, and append the character to the text string when the probability is above the threshold. It will then use the request library to send the text to the web browser. The final step will start the web server. This will run the web server on port 8000. The web server will load the index.html file, which will allow us to type in the box and see the autocomplete suggestions. This will train the model on the entire dataset. This may take several minutes depending on the size of the dataset. After the model has trained, we can use it to autocomplete the Python code. The first time you try this, it may take a few minutes to load the web page. This is because it is downloading the necessary files from TensorFlow. Once the web page loads, you should be able to start typing in the text box.

{"original_text": "China's National Health Commission has confirmed the first case of human infection with H10N3, a strain of bird flu. The patient survived and there were no other cases. Widespread transmission of H10N3 among humans has not been documented, but it can cause severe disease. There are two types of bird flu: H1N1 and H1N2, both of which cause mild disease in humans. H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 can cause severe disease and death in humans. The case of human infection with H10N3 was reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. The patient was a 67-year-old man from Suqian, Jiangsu Province, who had been exposed to infected poultry. He was hospitalized on March 2, 2019, with a fever and cough and was discharged on March 25 after recovery. The Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the case to the national authorities. The National Health Commission set up a task force to determine whether the patient had been infected with H10N3. The task force concluded that the case was confirmed as H10N3 infection on the basis of the results of nucleic acid detection and virus isolation and by antigenic detection. H10N3 viruses can cause disease in humans. Infection is usually mild or moderate, but can be severe. Previously, the only confirmed human cases of infection with H10N3 were in Hong Kong in 2000, 2001, and 2003. The Hong Kong Department of Health reported that all three patients were infected with H10N3 viruses from poultry, and all three fully recovered. The H10N3 virus was isolated from poultry in China in 2000, 2003, 2011, 2013, and 2016, but no human infections were reported. The H10N3 virus is highly pathogenic for poultry. It has been found in poultry in China, South Korea, and Hong Kong. No human infection with H10N3 had been confirmed in Hong Kong since 2003, but the virus was isolated from live poultry in 2013 and 2016. In addition, the virus has been found in wild ducks in Hong Kong, the Department of Health said. This suggests that the H10N3 virus was circulating in poultry in China for some time before it caused infection in humans. The H10N3 virus in the patient in Jiangsu was found to have mutations in its gene for the hemagglutinin protein, which is the main target of antibodies produced by infected people and those vaccinated against influenza. The patient's H10N3 virus had mutations that reduced its ability to bind to human receptors in the respiratory tract. The virus's ability to bind to receptors in the respiratory tract may be an important factor in transmission of the virus. If the virus has reduced binding to receptors in the respiratory tract, it may be less able to cause disease in humans. Although the patient fully recovered, he developed a secondary bacterial infection that required antibiotic treatment. The H10N3 virus isolated from the patient in Jiangsu was found to be highly pathogenic for poultry. The virus was lethal to domestic ducks and chickens. The H10N3 virus also caused disease in ferrets, which are considered to be a model of human influenza infection. The virus was detected in the upper respiratory tract of infected ferrets and was transmitted to ferrets by direct contact. The authors of the New England Journal of Medicine report say that the infection of the man in Jiangsu with H10N3 \"raises the possibility that this virus could cause additional cases of human infection in the future.\" \"To date, widespread transmission of H10N3 among humans has not been documented, and no severe disease or death has been reported in humans.

In addition, the virus has been found in wild ducks in Hong Kong, the Department of Health said. This suggests that the H10N3 virus was circulating in poultry in China for some time before it caused infection in humans. The H10N3 virus in the patient in Jiangsu was found to have mutations in its gene for the hemagglutinin protein, which is the main target of antibodies produced by infected people and those vaccinated against influenza. The patient's H10N3 virus had mutations that reduced its ability to bind to human receptors in the respiratory tract. The virus's ability to bind to receptors in the respiratory tract may be an important factor in transmission of the virus. If the virus has reduced binding to receptors in the respiratory tract, it may be less able to cause disease in humans. Although the patient fully recovered, he developed a secondary bacterial infection that required antibiotic treatment. The H10N3 virus isolated from the patient in Jiangsu was found to be highly pathogenic for poultry. The virus was lethal to domestic ducks and chickens. The H10N3 virus also caused disease in ferrets, which are considered to be a model of human influenza infection. The virus was detected in the upper respiratory tract of infected ferrets and was transmitted to ferrets by direct contact. The authors of the New England Journal of Medicine report say that the infection of the man in Jiangsu with H10N3 \"raises the possibility that this virus could cause additional cases of human infection in the future.\" \"To date, widespread transmission of H10N3 among humans has not been documented, and no severe disease or death has been reported in humans. Influenza viruses, including H10N3, can cause severe disease and death in humans. This is the first documented case of human infection with H10N3, a virus that has circulated among poultry for many years. \"The risk for human infection with this virus is likely low"}

The new homes will be printed at a fraction of the cost of homes in the US. The 3D printer is also being tested in El Salvador, and the Dutch organization hopes to begin printing homes in the US in 2018. The 3D printing technology could be a game changer for the housing industry, allowing for fast-paced production of homes that are relatively inexpensive, earthquake-resistant and fully recyclable. The 3D printer can print the basic structure of the house in about 24 hours. Workers will then put in doors, windows, toilets, kitchens and other finishes. The homes are designed to have a living area of 650 to 900 square feet. The 3D printer is able to print the main structure of the home, which is a hollow cube made up of two layers of cement. The hollow cube contains the plumbing and electrical lines, and the cube will be built on top of a foundation. The technology is expected to make home building cheaper, since it will eliminate the need for construction workers and expensive machinery. The homes are built from a new form of concrete that has been developed by the engineers from the University of Eindhoven. The concrete is made from a special type of cement that is created by burning rice husks. The cement is strong and can withstand earthquakes.

{"original_text": "Python 3.9 was released on October 5 and as with every new version of Python, it includes new, improved, and deprecated features. A link to the complete list of changes can be found at the end of this article. Let's have a look at the new features of Python 3.9. Python has built-in modules that can be used to perform scientific calculations such as statistics, calculus, interpolation, etc. The new version of Python brings several improvements to the functionality of the NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas modules. NumPy is the standard scientific library in Python that includes a multidimensional array object and provides the tools to create vectors, matrices, and tensors, as well as perform calculations on those objects. The 3.9 release includes significant improvements to the speed and functionality of this module. Performance is improved by 10-30 for indexing, slicing, and item assignment. New functionality has been added to the ufunc module, a group of common mathematical functions. It now supports multi-dimensional arrays. The module now includes a more robust implementation of the underlying data structure, the Array Object. This is also the reason for the improved performance of the module. The module includes additional functionality that makes it easier to handle and visualize data with many dimensions. Pandas is a data analysis library that provides a high-performance data structure called DataFrame. It has an API that allows users to perform operations such as loading data from files, performing mathematical calculations, and creating charts. The DataFrame module now includes a more efficient method of loading data from files in the form of Parquet files. Parquet is a columnar data format developed by Apache that provides efficient storage and querying of large datasets. The new functionality makes loading data from Parquet files much faster than in previous versions of Python. Improvements have also been made to the underlying C data structure for the DataFrame module, which results in an overall improvement to the functionality of the module. Matplotlib is the plotting library in Python that is used to create charts and graphs. The 3.9 release includes several improvements to the functionality of the library. Previously, the memory requirements for drawing charts with a large number of data points would be excessive, but now it is possible to display them without exceeding the memory limits of the computer. The module now includes the ability to support the color spectrum, which is useful when displaying charts with many colors. As mentioned, the built-in modules for scientific calculations now include many improvements, but they are not the only modules that have seen improvements. Many other modules such as random, multiprocessing, and datetime have also been improved. The random module, which provides functionality for generating random numbers, now has the ability to use a new random number generator that provides better performance. The multiprocessing module now has the ability to use the fork method of creating processes on Windows. Previously, it could only use the spawn method, which is not as efficient. The datetime module, which provides functionality for working with date and time values, now has the ability to convert date and time values to and from the ISO 8601 format, which is an internationally recognized format for representing date and time values. Python 3.9 is a significant update to the language, and the performance of the NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas modules have been significantly improved. Many other built-in modules have also been improved. This is an important release for the Python community, and hopefully, it will be an improvement for your projects as well.

{"original_text": "Boeing announced the first successful test flight of NeXt, its autonomous, short-range taxi. This prototype was unveiled at CES 2019, and has a range of 50 miles. It's 30 feet long and 8.5 feet wide, and has a top speed of 28 mph. The battery will charge to 80 in just 20 minutes, and can be fully recharged in just 1 hour. Boeing plans to expand the capabilities of the vehicle, including the ability to hover. The company also plans to develop an unmanned, long-range taxi capable of carrying passengers. The company plans to use a hybrid-electric propulsion system for a vehicle with a range of 300-500 miles. The unmanned taxi would be able to carry up to 50 passengers. Boeing NeXt aims to change the way we move, using electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. The company's autonomous aircraft will have the ability to move goods and people in a more environmentally friendly way, according to Steve Nordlund, vice president and general manager of Boeing NeXt. Boeing's goal is to have a safe and accessible autonomous air taxi system that can operate in urban areas. The company plans to test an autonomous aircraft in New Zealand this year. This will be part of the first test of an autonomous passenger-carrying air taxi. Boeing has also partnered with Uber and Aurora Flight Sciences to develop a fleet of autonomous electric aircraft that will be available for ride-sharing. These autonomous aircraft will have the capability to fly point-to-point, with no need to land and recharge. Uber plans to use these autonomous aircraft to develop an aerial ride-sharing network, similar to its current ride-sharing network for ground vehicles. The company plans to use the network to shuttle passengers from suburbs to city centers, cutting down on commute time. Aurora Flight Sciences is working on the technology that will allow these aircraft to safely operate in urban areas. The company is developing an advanced electric propulsion system that will improve the overall efficiency of the aircraft. The aircraft will have a low noise profile, and will operate using a distributed electric propulsion system. The aircraft will be able to take off and land vertically, and will be able to operate within a confined area of less than 100 square feet. Aurora Flight Sciences is also developing a pilotless aircraft that will have the capability to operate on military bases. The aircraft is designed to function without a pilot, and will also be able to take off and land vertically. Boeing has been making strides in the field of autonomous and electric aircraft. The company has also made advancements in the field of unmanned military aircraft. The company's newest unmanned military aircraft will have the ability to carry weapons. The Boeing MQ-25 Stingray is a military aircraft that has the capability to refuel military jets in midair. The aircraft will be able to fly for up to 4 hours without refueling, and can take off and land from a carrier's deck without a catapult launch or tailhook recovery. The aircraft can travel up to 500 nautical miles from the carrier. Boeing is also working on a military drone that will be able to carry weapons.

This prototype was unveiled at CES 2019, and has a range of 50 miles. It's 30 feet long and 8.5 feet wide, and has a top speed of 28 mph. The battery will charge to 80 in just 20 minutes, and can be fully recharged in just 1 hour. Boeing plans to expand the capabilities of the vehicle, including the ability to hover. The company also plans to develop an unmanned, long-range taxi capable of carrying passengers. The company plans to use a hybrid-electric propulsion system for a vehicle with a range of 300-500 miles. The unmanned taxi would be able to carry up to 50 passengers. Boeing NeXt aims to change the way we move, using electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. The company's autonomous aircraft will have the ability to move goods and people in a more environmentally friendly way, according to Steve Nordlund, vice president and general manager of Boeing NeXt. Boeing's goal is to have a safe and accessible autonomous air taxi system that can operate in urban areas. The company plans to test an autonomous aircraft in New Zealand this year. This will be part of the first test of an autonomous passenger-carrying air taxi. Boeing has also partnered with Uber and Aurora Flight Sciences to develop a fleet of autonomous electric aircraft that will be available for ride-sharing. These autonomous aircraft will have the capability to fly point-to-point, with no need to land and recharge. Uber plans to use these autonomous aircraft to develop an aerial ride-sharing network, similar to its current ride-sharing network for ground vehicles. The company plans to use the network to shuttle passengers from suburbs to city centers, cutting down on commute time. Aurora Flight Sciences is working on the technology that will allow these aircraft to safely operate in urban areas. The company is developing an advanced electric propulsion system that will improve the overall efficiency of the aircraft. The aircraft will have a low noise profile, and will operate using a distributed electric propulsion system. The aircraft will be able to take off and land vertically, and will be able to operate within a confined area of less than 100 square feet. Aurora Flight Sciences is also developing a pilotless aircraft that will have the capability to operate on military bases. The aircraft is designed to function without a pilot, and will also be able to take off and land vertically. Boeing has been making strides in the field of autonomous and electric aircraft. The company has also made advancements in the field of unmanned military aircraft. The company's newest unmanned military aircraft will have the ability to carry weapons.

Patience and perseverance will help with dealing with the roller coaster of emotions that comes with the job. I hope these suggestions will help. This is the hardest part of being a solo founder, but it is also the most important.

The founder needs to live and breathe the vision of the company. This vision will help with keeping you motivated when things get tough. When you have a vision for your company you need to focus on it. As a solo founder, you have to be careful what you spend your time on. Time is your most precious commodity. Don't get side tracked with something that does not further your goals. As a solo founder, you need to be able to quickly answer questions like: Who is your product for? What is the value of your product? How much does it cost? Why should someone buy it? Don't waste time trying to do it all. Focus on one thing and do it well. Nothing is more demotivating than not being able to get the things you need. The founder of a startup needs to be able to write code, market the product, and a million other tasks. You cannot be an expert in all of these areas. You can get things done by outsourcing andor getting a co-founder. The foundation of every company is the business model. It is critical to have a clear understanding of the business model. The founder must have a firm grasp of the finances of the company. Social media can be a great way to promote a product. It can also be a huge distraction.

Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon and Blue Origin, wants to send tourists to space this year. On Tuesday, Blue Origin launched the 14th test flight of its suborbital rocket, New Shepard, from its launch site in Van Horn, Texas. The rocket carried no passengers this time, but the capsule atop it can carry up to six people. Bezos said in a tweet that the flight reached an apogee - or peak altitude - of 351,000 feet, which was a record for New Shepard.

Blue Origin has been working on reusable rockets to reach suborbital space for a few years now. That's space that's just outside the boundary of Earth's atmosphere, but not far enough to orbit the Earth. The company has successfully launched and landed New Shepard 13 times, and has now launched and landed the rocket five times in a row. Tuesday's flight was the first time New Shepard flew a capsule with the same parachutes it will use to land tourists. \"We've already started to manufacture the first flight test escape motor for capsule escape and have started building the first test article of the capsule abort motor,\" Blue Origin said in its preflight video. \"In parallel, our New Shepard flight test program is continuing.\" Bezos first announced plans for New Shepard in November 2015. The capsule and rocket are designed to launch people to suborbital space - a little more than 62 miles above the Earth's surface. Blue Origin plans to use the same technology to build a lunar lander, as part of the company's goal to help NASA send people to the moon by 2024. \"The first New Shepard mission that flies with people on board will also carry scientific payloads and Blue Origin's charter science manager, Dr. Kristin Kierstead, will help ensure those payloads are integrated and conducting experiments in line with mission objectives,\" Blue Origin said. Blue Origin said in July 2018 that the first crewed New Shepard flight would take place before the end of that year. The company delayed the flight, and has not yet announced when it will launch people into space. \"As we've said before, we're going to fly the hell out of this vehicle before we put our test pilots on board,\" Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin's head of astronaut strategy and sales, told Business Insider in November 2018. \"And that's exactly what we're doing.\" SEE ALSO: SpaceX just launched a space station supply mission.

Serial Productions was formed in 2017 after the success of the podcast, which has been downloaded over 300 million times since its launch in 2014. Serial Productions' first project was S-Town, a 2017 spin-off series from Serial. S-Town has been downloaded over 100 million times, according to Apple. The company's next project, an investigative podcast about a troubled adoption agency called This American Life, is slated to premiere later this year.

{"original_text": "The 61st International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is the first IMO that has been held remotely and may also be the last time that artificial intelligence doesn't compete. Researchers view the IMO as a particularly vulnerable target because its questions require proof rather than a numerical answer. \"AI already beats humans in board games. It's going to be so easy to replace humans in these contests,\" said Dr Joel Hamkins, a mathematician and philosopher at the City University of New York. Dr Hamkins gave a presentation about the use of AI in IMO at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in January 2019 and an overview of the issues with the Associated Press. In his opinion, there is no reason why the IMO cannot be automated. For example, if a computer could solve a problem, it could be programmed to provide a full proof for the solution. \"The IMO is simply a test of who has learned the most math,\" he said. \"And in the future, the AI will be able to learn the same amount of math as a human being.\" The contest is a very vulnerable target because it requires proof rather than a numerical answer. Dr Hamkins has been using the latest developments in AI to create 'impossible' math problems that, in theory, no human could solve. The goal is to encourage the development of new AI systems that could outperform humans in solving mathematical problems. He has already created an AI that is capable of solving mathematical problems equivalent to first-year undergraduate math. However, it is not very fast and requires a lot of memory space. \"For a computer to be able to do a good job of answering a math question, it has to understand what the question is asking. Humans can do that, but machines can struggle.\" \"But if the math problem is easy enough and you're trying to solve it with a computer, then the difficulty is going to be too easy.\" \"If you get the level right, then it's really hard to get the proof. And if you get the level wrong, then it's really easy to get the proof. The difficulty of getting the level right is one of the things that makes the IMO hard.\" \"We're still at the point where it's very hard to get the difficulty level just right.\" In the future, AI will be able to learn the same amount of math as a human being. Dr Hamkins predicts that the 62nd IMO in 2021 will be the last IMO that is conducted manually. \"I don't know whether we will be ready to have an IMO that is fully run by AI by the 2021 IMO, but I think that's a good goal to shoot for,\" he said. The 61st IMO is being held in Bath, UK. This is the first IMO that has been held remotely. More than 600 students from 100 countries competed in the first round in July. The IMO has been held annually since 1959, with 104 countries participating. The competition is very popular in China and Russia, but it is also growing in popularity in many countries including the United States. The IMO is held in a different country each year. The country acts as host and organises and runs the event.
