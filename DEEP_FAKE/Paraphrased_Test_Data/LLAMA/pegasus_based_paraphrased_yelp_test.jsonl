{"original_text": "It was a pampering experience but unless money is no object I wouldn't go for the food, which was fine but unremarkable. My hot smoked salmon would have passed for a tinned salmon if I hadn't known better, and I didn't like my crab cake which was gummy and needed a sauce. The prawns were tasty, but not that different from what I would get from Sainsbury's. The ambience was very nice. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. I liked the exposed brick and the large windows which let the light flood in, but it was not very busy and this is the second time I have been when there were very few diners. The kitchen is open and I have to say that it wasn't very busy there either. I had booked a manicure and pedicure which were very relaxing, and I was allowed to take my time. The nail polish was not as good as I had expected, however, and I had to re-do mine myself at home. I was given a glass of champagne when I booked, and a glass of Prosecco when I finished the pedicure.

Two stars for the large portions and pretty fast service, but it's not worth the calories. Go to PF Changs instead! Easy parking. Great place to take kids. Good food! Kids loved the fortune cookies! We were there for an evening meal and had a party of 14. The restaurant was very busy but we were seated quickly. They were very accommodating for my gluten-free daughter. The server was very attentive. The food was very good! I will definitely go back. The food was amazing and the service was great! We will definitely be back! The place is so clean and the staff is very helpful and nice. Food is always delicious. We had a party of 12 in a private room. The food was excellent. The room was perfect. The service was outstanding. The manager checked on us several times. The food was served hot and the portions were generous. We will return and would recommend to friends.

{"original_text": "Shelled out over 100 on the first night of our long awaited trip to Vegas. Thought it was pretty good, until the food poisoning hit the next day. Had to go to the emergency room at St Rose. You would think I'd learn by now not to eat hamburger from the cheap places in Vegas. Luckily, I got it on my insurance. I ended up spending a lot more in Vegas than I originally planned, but I made the best of it. Even got to go to the top of the Stratosphere. When we got back from Vegas, we had to go and buy a new toilet. I think it is the second time this year we've had to replace that toilet. It's a good thing we got a 10 year warranty on it. We can't be more than halfway through the warranty, though. It has been a really, really long year. The upstairs toilet also had a problem. After a few weeks of flushing it every hour or so, we decided to replace that toilet too. Hopefully, that will be the last of the toilets for a while. That's about it for the month. I'm going to be really busy next month. I have to take a week of vacation in the middle of the month, and the week after that, I have to take a three day trip to a client. I'm really dreading that trip, especially since I have to stay in a hotel.

{"original_text": "Worst company out there. I live in a community managed by ACM and it's a joke. They are rude and anytime you have a problem or complaint and call about it, they don't want to hear it. They treat you like you're bothering them. They never return phone calls. They don't care about anything and have no regard for the residents. Don't waste your time with ACM! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! WORST PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY EVER! We have had nothing but problems with this company since moving into a townhome. The last straw was when we found out that they were notified of a sewer issue within the townhome and told them that we had a sewer issue and the workers were not allowed to fix the issue because they would have to enter the neighbors house to fix the issue. They would not contact the owner. The sewer issue caused the toilet to overflow and we had to call a plumber out to fix it. The plumber called ACM and they STILL would not contact the owner. They said they would send someone out, they never did and this happened on a Friday. We had a plumber come out on a Saturday to fix the issue. They sent out someone on a Monday and he broke the toilet again. He did not fix the issue. ACM had to send someone out a second time to fix the issue. They charged us 450 for the fix. It was a 25 fix. We moved out because they are the worst and we wanted to get out of our lease. They wouldn't let us out of our lease because they said we were late on a payment. We were not late on the payment. Our payment was set up to come out on the 15th of the month. That is what we paid our rent on for the 12 months we lived there. ACM changed the date and we were not notified. We paid the rent on the 15th because that is what we had always paid it on. We didn't know that they changed the date. They tried to charge us 150 for late rent that we didn't owe and threatened to put us in collections if we didn't pay. We had to pay it because we had to move. It was the worst experience we have ever had. I will NEVER do business with them again. The ACM Group is an incredible property management company. Everyone from the office staff to the maintenance crew is always very professional, friendly and prompt to respond to any issues that arise. I have lived at their properties for over 8 years and couldn't be happier.

{"original_text": "Congratulations to the Democratic party for being so divided that they can't even agree on a candidate to be considered for the general election. Nice job fellas. You're pushing a lot of people into the arms of the Republican party. Not that I'm complaining. The best thing about this particular battle for the nomination is the ammunition we're getting. The more Hillary and Obama fight, the more dirt is exposed. And I think it's fair game to use that dirt. It's not like they're not using it on each other. I've made it no secret that I despise Hillary Clinton. I really don't like her. I think she's a bitchy little sneak with too much power. If she's elected President, we're in big trouble. She's just as bad as her husband, if not worse. So, yes, I'm going to use the ammunition I'm being handed and do my best to make sure she doesn't get elected. The following video is, in my opinion, one of the most damning pieces of footage against her. And the fact that it was leaked from a debate that was supposed to be off-the-record is just icing on the cake. Pay close attention to the rhetoric she's using. And notice that she's saying this in public. She's obviously proud of it. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who will tell me that I'm being unfair. But these are the tactics that Hillary Clinton employs when she wants to get something done. And that's the scariest part. The power that she has, and her willingness to use it to do what she wants. If you're a fan of Hillary's, this probably hasn't changed your mind. I understand that. She's pretty, and she says what you want to hear. But don't let that blind you to the fact that she's a power-hungry woman who will do whatever it takes to get her way. If you don't believe me, ask Bill. Ever since he's been out of office, he's been on a role. The man has been eating and drinking his way across the country. And let's be honest. The guy looks like shit. He looks old and bloated. I'm sure he doesn't feel good about himself. I bet the only time he feels good is when he's in the White House. I bet he misses the attention. I bet he misses feeling like the most powerful man in the world. I bet he misses Hillary. She's the reason he got into office. And she's the reason he stayed there. He owes everything to her. And I have a feeling he'll do anything to keep her in power. Labels: Hillary Clinton, politics, YouTube At Wednesday, February 06, 2008 8:24:00 PM, Heather said... I despise that woman as well, but I'll take her over Obama. At Wednesday, February 06, 2008 10:36:00 PM, Mr. Apron said... At Wednesday, February 06, 2008 11:56:00 PM, Nilsa SoMi Speaks said... I'm going to have to disagree with you here, not about Clinton, but about Obama. I think the two of them would make a great president and vice-president team. I think Obama could use a Clinton in his corner when it comes to getting the job done. I also think he could use Clinton's expertise when it comes to foreign policy.

Nice job fellas. You're pushing a lot of people into the arms of the Republican party. Not that I'm complaining. The best thing about this particular battle for the nomination is the ammunition we're getting. The more Hillary and Obama fight, the more dirt is exposed. And I think it's fair game to use that dirt. It's not like they're not using it on each other. I've made it no secret that I despise Hillary Clinton. I really don't like her. I think she's a bitchy little sneak with too much power. If she's elected President, we're in big trouble. She's just as bad as her husband, if not worse. So, yes, I'm going to use the ammunition I'm being handed and do my best to make sure she doesn't get elected. The following video is, in my opinion, one of the most damning pieces of footage against her. And the fact that it was leaked from a debate that was supposed to be off-the-record is just icing on the cake. Pay close attention to the rhetoric she's using. And notice that she's saying this in public. She's obviously proud of it. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who will tell me that I'm being unfair. But these are the tactics that Hillary Clinton employs when she wants to get something done. And that's the scariest part. The power that she has, and her willingness to use it to do what she wants. If you're a fan of Hillary's, this probably hasn't changed your mind. I understand that. She's pretty, and she says what you want to hear. But don't let that blind you to the fact that she's a power-hungry woman who will do whatever it takes to get her way. If you don't believe me, ask Bill. Ever since he's been out of office, he's been on a role. The man has been eating and drinking his way across the country. And let's be honest. The guy looks like shit. He looks old and bloated. I'm sure he doesn't feel good about himself. I bet the only time he feels good is when he's in the White House. I bet he misses the attention. I bet he misses feeling like the most powerful man in the world. I bet he misses Hillary. She's the reason he got into office. And she's the reason he stayed there. He owes everything to her. And I have a feeling he'll do anything to keep her in power. Labels: Hillary Clinton, politics, YouTube At Wednesday, February 06, 2008 8:24:00 PM, Heather said...

I'm going to have to disagree with you here, not about Clinton, but about Obama. I think the two of them would make a great president and vice-president team. I think Obama could use a Clinton in his corner when it comes to getting the job done. I also think he could use Clinton's expertise when it comes to foreign policy. I know you're a staunch Republican, but if you don't think Obama has it in him to be a strong president, then you haven't been paying attention. He's got what it takes.

The \"No Trespassing\" signs are a dead giveaway. There's a construction crew that's been using the place for their break room.

{"original_text": "We stayed here for a bachelorette party during Labor Day weekend. We were 9 people in total, and wanted to be able to stay pretty much in a large suite without spending a fortune. Palms Place suited that bill nicely.

Best decision we ever made, as it was only a couple hundred bucks more per night (split 9 ways, natch). Unfortunately for both us and the Palms Place staff, there were TONS of issues with the first suite they put us in. A couple girls got locked the master bath on at least 3 separate occasions, the hot tub on the balcony didn't work, the fireplace didn't work, and we didn't have an ice maker, just to name a few.

{"original_text": "I give two stars because I usually use this location to get water before a hike. Yesterday I come in to get water and the cashier is talking with her friend about something personal. She literally ignores me for at least 10 minutes. I continue to wait, not wanting to interrupt her personal conversation, as I am waiting for her to ring up my water. I then approach her and ask her to please ring up my water. She puts it on the counter, without a word to me. I am still ignored. I then tell her to have a nice day. She proceeds to say to me, in an attitude, \"You know you have to pay for that, right?\" I then apologize to her for being so rude and not ringing up my water sooner. And this was at 8:30 am in the morning. I have never seen this kind of rude behavior at any Safeway I have been to. The only thing I find acceptable about this location is the cleanliness of the bathrooms. There is no other reason to shop here. The customer service is the worst I have ever seen in a grocery store. And I am not the only one that feels this way. Check out the reviews on Yelp. This is a store that if they had better management would be a great store. If it was closer to my house I would probably use it. However it is not closer to my house, so I never use it. I do not buy gas here because it is always higher than all the other stations in the area, even though it is usually closer to my home than the other stations. I have had many instances where the cashiers were talking amongst themselves and completely ignore the fact that I was standing there waiting for them to ring up my groceries. If the management would find a way to encourage their cashiers to treat their customers like they are paying their salary, then I would shop here more often. But since this doesn't seem to be the case, I will continue to travel further to a store that has a better attitude towards their customers. This was the worst customer service I have ever received. I had a problem with a stalking situation and I asked them to block this person from using my number. They laughed at me and refused to block this person. This person continued to stalk me. I am a woman in my 50's and have never been treated so badly before. I will never go back to this store and will tell all of my friends to avoid it as well. I live on the Eastside and I refuse to drive 35 miles to this store for gas. I always drive past this store because the prices are always higher than the other stations in the area. It doesn't make sense to me to go to a store that is further away from my home, but the prices are higher. I find this store to be the cleanest in the area. I usually go to the Walmart Neighborhood Market, which is about the same distance away. However, I find that the Safeway is cleaner, and seems to have a better quality of food. I find I can find a lot more at this store than I can find at the Walmart Neighborhood Market. I do not find the prices to be any different than the Walmart Neighborhood Market. I find this Safeway to be very convenient. It is close to my home, and I can find almost anything I need for my family. I especially like their meat department, and the produce is usually very fresh. The staff is friendly, and I like to shop here because of the convenience. This Safeway is always clean and well stocked. The staff is always friendly. The prices are comparable to other stores in the area. I like this store and shop here often. The staff is always friendly and I have no complaints about the store. I always find what I need, and I enjoy shopping here. I don't find the prices to be much different than any other store in the area. The employees are always very friendly. I find they always have what I am looking for. The prices are comparable to other stores in the area. I enjoy shopping at this location. This is the store I go to most often.

{"original_text": "The Two Stars are for the servers that try their best. This used to be my favorite place for all special occasions. Not anymore. I went their for my birthday, this past Saturday, Feb. 2nd, 2019. I had a reservation. It was my birthday. I was dressed nicely. I had my three year old with me. We are a party of 12, plus an infant. I called a few weeks before to let them know we are a large party. The day before the reservation, I called to confirm the reservation. I made sure to inform them that we are a large party. At 7:30pm, when we got there, we were told we would have to wait for a table for 20 minutes. There were three people in front of us. We waited 25 minutes. The host was sitting at the table next to us. My family was dressed nicely. I asked the host if I could have the table next to him because it's my birthday and I would like to sit there. I asked if he could move a few things so I can sit there. He told me they are saving that table for the band and that they are not ready yet. My family and I were sitting at the other table for 25 minutes. I asked him if I can have the table next to him. He refused and said that I cannot have it. There was a lot of empty tables. I asked the waiter to tell the manager that I would like the table next to the host and I asked him to bring me a dessert. After 15 minutes, we got our table. My dessert never came. When I asked, I was told that the manager has to approve it. The manager came and said he did not approve it. We ordered our food. My food came out cold. I asked the server if I could have a new order because it was cold. The manager came and said he could not replace my food because it was made the way it is supposed to be. I asked him what happened to my dessert. He said that he did not approve it. He told me that I cannot get a dessert because I had a reservation. I told him that I called to confirm my reservation and I asked him to tell me what is the difference between a reservation and a walk in. He told me that he cannot give me my dessert because I had a reservation. The manager was so rude. He told me that I cannot eat at his restaurant. He told me that I am too loud. My 3 year old was with me. I had a table of 12 and an infant. I have never been treated this way. I felt humiliated. I did not receive my dessert. I was charged for my cold food. I did not go to the restaurant to make a scene. I went there to have a nice time. All I wanted was a dessert. All he had to do is tell me sorry that I cannot give you a dessert because we are closing. This is not the first time I had issues with this restaurant. I went there a few months ago with my husband. We had a reservation. They seated us in a hallway. I asked the manager if I could have another table. He told me that we cannot sit anywhere else. I ended up leaving. I called to complain. The manager said that he did not say that. I have a voice recording of the conversation. I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager again. I spoke to him for a few minutes. He still did not apologize. He told me that he does not want my business and that he does not want to see me at his restaurant. I have never been treated this way before. I will not return to this restaurant. I will never recommend this restaurant. Sofia, what you experienced is atrocious and my heart goes out to you. You deserved better. Unfortunately, this is what happens when people become entitled, they don't realize how unreasonable their behavior is. It happens everywhere. I was recently at a restaurant (not Cuban) and a group of people came in. It was around 9:45 pm and they were not very happy that the waiter told them they could not order dinner. They were also drinking and yelling at the waiter. The manager got involved and tried to explain to them that he could not accommodate them since the kitchen was closed. They were not happy about it and they started to yell at him and told him that they were going to close his restaurant down. I was appalled at this behavior. If I had been the manager, I would have asked them to leave. Needless to say, they did not get their food. I felt so bad for the manager who was trying his best to please them.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "In our series of letters from African-American journalists, novelist, and writer Ta-Nehisi Coates reflects on her time at The Two Stars restaurant in Washington, DC."}

Not your typical deli but deli style creations that are made with old style, with high quality wide range of cured meats that are sliced in front of you, depending on what you like or don't like.

Love the eggs benedict, the mushroom and the chorizo and potato hash. I love the breakfast options here, especially the eggs benedict. The other half loves the chorizo and potato hash. The cakes are to die for. Especially the carrot cake. I can't wait for the new restaurant to open up.

Service is friendly, they are happy to accommodate you. I have been there twice and both times have enjoyed it. I like the meat and cheese platter with bread and jam. Good food, good prices and the cheese is good. Service is a little slow but they are very friendly and helpful. Amazing service and food. I love the chorizo potato hash and the Italian style sausage.

So, the wife and I decided to check out Mekong for their dim sum brunch. Now, the prices are extremely fair. There are 4 pricing categories for their dim sum, A, B, C, and D. All choices A through C are priced at 2.18, while D is priced at 4.95. Sodas are sold by the can, so we chose to have one can each of cola and we shared a pot of tea. We're not picky, but we chose not to indulge on the lovely assortments of buntype dishes that were presented to us. Instead, we focused our attention and appetite on the pork, chicken, and seafood offerings. And boy, we were not disappointed with the food! Some of our treats included shrimp shumai, chicken and shrimp crispy spring rolls, pork spare ribs with black bean sauce (basically just a serving of pork fat with some bone in it, but incredibly tasty), taro cakes, sharkfin dumplings, and several others. The servers were attentive, wheeling their cars around to every occupied table in the establishment. Well, all the servers except for one. I couldn't help but notice that one server seemed to avoid our table. At first, I thought it was my imagination. But then my wife noticed. In fact, I watched her as she pushed her cart past us while making an effort to look in the opposite direction! Of course, her cart had the items we were most interested in, so we were quite disappointed by her. Were it not for that one server, we'd be giving our experience here 5 stars. I purposely struck up a conversation with one of the other servers, a very pleasant young man, who was managing a cart that had the words beef organs on the side. I asked him what he was offering, and when he described it to me, I could not conceal my interest. He joked with us that he didn't think we'd be interested in his dish. Well, he was half right....my wife didn't want anything to do with it! That plate was very interesting. It consisted of various organ meats, including tripe and liver that I could identify, and several others I could not. All of the meats were very soft and tender, which is unusual for organ meats. My wife even tried some (what a trooper). We should all be glad I'm the one writing this review:) Another of the dishes we tried was a flat noodle with shrimp. Slippery devils, these were! I was having such a hard time picking these up with chopsticks that one of the other wait staff was attentive enough to offer us forks. He did it so politely that we joked with him to feign our offense, but we were actually quite thankful. The place settings do not include forks (an indication of their cultural authenticity, perhaps?) Oh, be thankful that there is a menu with pictures of each offering. Most of the servers do not speak fluent English. But when you ask them what they are serving, they can point to the picture and you can read it yourself! Overall, a fun experience. Plenty of food, at bargain prices. And before you leave, be sure to take a stroll through Mekong Plaza (the grocery store next door) and take in all the exotic tasties they have to offer.

Understand, I have frequented this place since we moved into the area 5 years ago. I have also watched the food quality deteriorate over the past few years. It's not horrible, it's just not what it used to be. The most recent experience was horrible. I ordered the traditional spaghetti and meatballs... I was excited because it came with a side of garlic bread. When the food came, the meatballs were, literally, 12 the size of the first time I had them. The garlic bread was a piece of bread with a tiny amount of garlic butter. The spaghetti was slightly overcooked and the sauce was completely different than the previous times I had it. I am also an avid cheesesteak fan and the cheesesteak has been steadily declining over the past few years. I've eaten there, probably, 20 times and this was the worst experience I've had. That being said, the wine selection is excellent, the service is impeccable, and they have a great selection of cheeses and meats for takeout.

Posted by AriesLady on August 19, 2010 at 10:34 AM I was really excited about this place when it first opened. I was even more excited when I had a wonderful meal there. Unfortunately, my experience has been going downhill ever since. Last time I was there, I ordered the brisket sandwich with sweet potato fries.

The wine selection is always top notch.... but they lost me on the food! Understand, I have frequented this place since we moved into the area 5 years ago. I have also watched the food quality deteriorate over the past few years. It's not horrible, it's just not what it used to be. The most recent experience was horrible. I ordered the traditional spaghetti and meatballs... I was excited because it came with a side of garlic bread. When the food came, the meatballs were, literally, 12 the size of the first time I had them. The garlic bread was a piece of bread with a tiny amount of garlic butter. The spaghetti was slightly overcooked and the sauce was completely different than the previous times I had it. I am also an avid cheesesteak fan and the cheesesteak has been steadily declining over the past few years. I've eaten there, probably, 20 times and this was the worst experience I've had. That being said, the wine selection is excellent, the service is impeccable, and they have a great selection of cheeses and meats for takeout. Posted by soccermom on August 21, 2010 at 10:13 PM Re: \"Kitchen Sink\" Went here for lunch with two friends. I ordered the Kitchen Sink burger and added bacon. It was great. It's a big burger, so be prepared. The side I had, curly fries, were good, too. The service was great as well. We had a lively server who was very attentive. I liked the atmosphere of the place. It's a small, friendly place. I'll definitely be back. Posted by thefauxcatsmother on August 20, 2010 at 3:19 PM We go there at least once a week. They have a great brunch menu, but we usually get their lunch specials. They are filling, and very reasonably priced. They have great soups, salads, and wraps. This is one of the few places in town that serves a real Caesar salad. They have great desserts, too. Posted by AllergyAunt on August 19, 2010 at 2:57 PM I went here on a Saturday night, and was very impressed. The food was great, and the service was also excellent. I had the Greek salad, which was delicious, and one of the specials, which was a spinach cannelloni. I highly recommend this place. Posted by AriesLady on August 19, 2010 at 12:52 PM I have to say, I love this place! I have been here a few times, and have enjoyed it every time. The service is good, the food is great, and the prices are reasonable. We usually get the 12-price appetizers, and they are more than enough for two people. I have had the shrimp and grits (delicious), the crab cakes (yum), and a burger. The burger was so good that I would order it again. They have a great beer selection, too. Posted by AriesLady on August 19, 2010 at 10:34 AM I was really excited about this place when it first opened. I was even more excited when I had a wonderful meal there. Unfortunately, my experience has been going downhill ever since. Last time I was there, I ordered the brisket sandwich with sweet potato fries.

Lately I've been working with a lot of quick service chains to help them with their social media and one of my goals is to help them create a better customer experience, so when it was time to try a few places to see how they're doing I decided to give Jimmy John's a try. I walked in and ordered a 6 combo with no sprouts. The person making the sandwich asked me if I wanted them on the side, I said \"no sprouts.\" He asked again, so I said \"sprouts are not on the sandwich.\" He said \"I'm just making sure you want them on the side.\" I said \"no\" again, this time with more enthusiasm. I thought he was joking, but he wasn't. I walked away with my sandwich. I sat down at a table and took off the top piece of bread to take a look. Of course there were sprouts on the sandwich. I walked back up to the counter and the guy behind the counter said \"what's up?.\" I said \"I ordered this sandwich without sprouts and you put them on the sandwich.\" He said \"are you sure?.\" I said \"yes, I was there, I ordered it, I paid for it, I walked away with it.\" He said \"I'm sorry, what can I do to make it right?\" I said \"I want a new sandwich with no sprouts on it.\" He said \"you're gonna have to wait in line again.\" I said \"no, I want you to go back and get it off the board and make me a new one with no sprouts.\" He said \"okay, I'll be right back\" and walked away. I waited and waited. At this point there was only one person in line. Eventually someone else showed up and asked \"what's up?.\" The guy behind the counter said \"just give him whatever he ordered.\" The new person said \"yeah, I got it\" and started making the sandwich.

WHAT A MISTAKE! I began having second thoughts when I walked through the casino to the elevators; the check-in was ok, though they wanted to charge me extra for being an hour early and sent me to get a rewards card to avoid the fee. The casino has a worn, depressing, smoked-out truck stop feel to it, like the Golden Nugget. OK, I told myself. But it is cheaper. I boarded the elevator with my friends, they were staying elsewhere and wanted to see the Flamingo for the first time. The elevators closed, revealing kick marks, scuffs, dirt and smears all over the interior. They opened to reveal carpet taped down with old duct tape. We walked past the old vending and ice machines, right in the hall, no room of their own. It gets better! As we entered my room, there was a nasty fake fur godawful throw laying across the bed, sticky stuff on the floor, mildew around the tub, blistered ceiling and cracks above the shower, and the closet door was hanging off its rollers. A look inside revealed that the entire door was peeling apart. The safe was useless- swipe any casino card from any casino (it asks you to swipe a credit card- yeah, right!!) and it will open.

He said the 14 was a fee that included mounting, balancing and disposal fee and the 1.75 was the disposal fee only. He said the tire disposal fee was mandated by the State of California.

Wow, so disappointed in this. Will never order from this place again. Horrible service!!! Posted by Marissa A. on August 06, 2015. Brought to you by yahoolocal. We used to love this place but haven't been there for awhile. We went back last week and were extremely disappointed. The food was not good at all. Nothing stood out as being any good. The lamb shanks were ok but not good. The chicken was dry. The vegetables were pretty bland. The bread was awful. Posted by Anthony M. on July 24, 2015. Brought to you by yahoolocal.

{"original_text": "The only reason we used to come here every week was for the food. Needless to say the got rid of the best menu items they had again. They used to have excellent stuffed peppers, now the stuffed peppers are made with very little cheese, peppers, and meat. It just looked like a pile of sauce on the plate. They used to have homemade meatballs, now the meatballs look like canned meatballs and taste like it too. They used to have some excellent sandwiches. Now they just have panini's which are very boring. I think the best item on the menu now is the pizza. The service is always good, but I'm not sure how much longer I can deal with the food being so bad. This place has become very boring and I'm not sure what they think they are doing. I know everyone loves Olive Garden, but I'll take this place any day over that. I also understand that they have a lot of the same items. It just seems like the have a lot less quality food now. This is the only restaurant in town that has great food! Their pizza is like the pizza in New York. The service is great. They have a really nice bar. The pizza is extremely fresh and delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone. After visiting here numerous times over the years, I have to say the service is always good. They always have really nice servers and they always do a good job of getting your food out in a timely manner. My only complaint is that I don't think they have any good items on the menu. I have ordered a variety of items and I have never been blown away by any of them. There just isn't much flavor in the food. I would say the pasta is probably the best thing on the menu, but it's not anything special. The salad bar is good. I'm not sure if I would recommend this place. The only reason I would come here is for the salad bar. It's pretty good. The salad bar is the only reason I come here. The pizza is extremely mediocre and the pasta is very bland.

{"original_text": "My husband and I wanted to try something new for date night and I've known about Bachi Burger for years through Yelp as one of the best burgers in Las Vegas as well as all of my friends constantly obsessing over it. We got here on a Friday night with a 25 minute wait which wasn't a big deal because we just walked over to Patty's closet to kill time. My in-laws said we have to try the salty caramel toasted marshmallow milkshake and we did. I'd say this was the best item of the night! It was a bit overly sweet, but still so addicting. We then ordered the oxtail chilli cheese fries as our appetizer to share. Upon first bite, I told my husband it was cold. I don't know if they made the fries and chilli and were just waiting for the fried egg to be put on top, but the food was definitely lukewarm by the time it was brought out to us and I like my food super hot, like it was made fresh. There wasn't much oxtail that I could taste and the warmth issue was very off putting. Lastly, we settled for the Miyagi San burger and Ronin burger. I LOVE fusion food, but I was not impressed by the flavors of the Ronin. Something was just missing to make it amazing. I did appreciate the crunch of the coleslaw and the caramelized onions, but all the other flavors cancelled out the taste of the fried egg. My husband's Miyagi burger was much better, but we asked for it medium and it was WELL done. There was no pink or anything, but the taste of the fried egg was amazing and the onion strips were crispy and fried to perfection. Overall, I would say that Holsteins has better burgers for this price range, and to not believe the DDD and Yelp hype.

We had a big party and people trickled in over the course of an hour and a half, but our waitress was patient and attentive and made the experience feel intimate. The food was great, and even though we ordered a little of everything from the menu, the waitress and the kitchen staff made sure we had everything we needed and enjoyed. The garlic bread is amazing, and the chicken parm is delicious. If you're looking for a place to have dinner with your family in the city, this is the place. Our server was phenomenal and we never had to ask for anything. The food was excellent and we couldn't have been happier with the experience. I've been here many times and have never had a bad experience. Food is great. Service is great. Ambiance is nice. Food was good, but service was slow and we were overcharged for a bottle of wine. We had a great time with our dinner and the service was great. Such a great experience, I can't wait to go back! Great food, attentive service. We will definitely be back again! This was my second time at Enoteca Maria, and my friends and I enjoyed the food, ambiance, and service. Our waiter, Anthony, was fantastic and the owner came over to greet us and offer a sample of olive oil. I highly recommend this restaurant! Always a great meal and service! Food was not good. Asked for something to be done with the sauce and it was like i asked for it to be from another planet. Too spicy! Went to this restaurant for the first time as I was meeting a friend. It is a small restaurant, but the atmosphere was wonderful. They serve authentic Italian food and we had a great meal. The restaurant was sooo cold!! There were 2 parties of 6 who had dinner, so 12 in total. I know the restaurant is small, but you can't have 12 people in a small restaurant and not heat it, the server said she would tell the manager to turn up the heat, but they didn't. We didn't have to wait long for our entrees and our server was very attentive. Food was great. A bit too noisy for an intimate meal. Food is good but not outstanding. Nice place for dinner. Food was very good. Service was also good. Food was very good. The service was very friendly. The ambiance was great. Wonderful meal in a very intimate setting. It is a small, cozy restaurant and we loved the ambiance. We will be back! It was a great meal and the service was great. We sat in the back room and it was a nice quiet space. Wonderful dinner with great service! Would love to have been seated in the back room- it's cozy and quiet. I loved the menu, the food was great, the service was great, it was a great experience all around. Love, love, love this restaurant. We go every time we're in NYC. We just returned from our visit this past weekend. Food and service were excellent and the prices were good. The ambience was warm, friendly and welcoming. Excellent food, superb service, excellent ambiance! Great food and service. Our waiter, Anthony, was amazing and very attentive. Highly recommend. The food was really good and the atmosphere was cozy and welcoming. This was my first visit to the restaurant. The food was excellent. The service was attentive, but did not intrude. And I loved the menu concept and the fact that all the mothers were so involved. Great food and service! Will be back! This was our 5th visit to Enoteca Maria and we were not disappointed. The food is consistently delicious. The staff is always friendly and attentive. It's the perfect spot for a meal that is not too fancy and not too casual. We'll be back for the 6th time soon. My partner and I have been going to Enoteca Maria for years. It's one of our favorite places to go in New York.

I ordered sushi. My food was MIA. My husband was completely finished by the time my food arrived. The sushi was not fresh. Some of it I couldn't even eat.

He took our drink orders and took another 15 minutes to return. We placed our orders, and waited. While we waited, 2 servers attempted to bring us food that was not ours. Everyone seemed to be confused and rushed. My husbands food arrived..... And we waited some more. He ordered the hibachi. I ordered sushi. My food was MIA. My husband was completely finished by the time my food arrived. The sushi was not fresh. Some of it I couldn't even eat. We decided to skip dessert and just get out of there. When the server finally brought our bill, it was hand written and very confusing. I asked the server to explain all the charges. I pointed out that we were charged for my husbands salad, which was included on the meal. The server went and changed it. I asked what the charge was at the bottom, and he said it was our drinks. But they were included above. I finally asked to see the manager, and he explained that extra charge was an 18 gratuity already included because we were sitting in the little private room. What? Are you serious? We complained about the service and food, and the botched bill, and the manager gave us the meal for free. While I appreciated the effort to make it better, We will never return. Don't ever go there! That place should be shut down!"}

They offer a great variety of food, including different types of hot dogs, burgers, sandwiches, salads and poutines. There was a vegan and vegetarian menu available for those with dietary restrictions as well. The food was delicious! I came with a big group so I got to try different things. The service was fast and friendly and the restaurant itself is very modern. They are located in the heart of downtown and it is great place to stop by if you are in the area.

Have brought many of our friends and neighbors, they also love Las Cazuelas, food is great, the margaritas are fabulous and the staff is the best!!

My favorite is the Chicken Enchiladas with Salsa Verde (one of the best in town). The Tamales are also amazing. The servers are friendly and efficient and the margaritas are strong. I'm very disappointed in the service and food quality. We went for lunch, sat down and waited 30 minutes to be served. I ordered a beef enchilada and a side of beans and rice.

{"original_text": "We arrived at the restaurant during early evening on a Thursday. There were only two other customers at the time sitting at a corner table. The female at that table was dressed in a similar style to the \"hostess.\" I'm assuming she was the owner, and the hostess. The hostess brought us to a table right by the front window. We were able to see the parking lot from our seats. We had a good view of the cars pulling in and the customers walking in. I had a hard time choosing an appetizer. I knew I wanted something a bit lighter, and didn't want a salad. The hostess described the rolls as \"crispy,\" so I decided to get a few to start. The rolls were served with a thin, tasty, sweet, dark brown sauce. The sauce was very good. The rolls themselves were not as crispy as I expected, but they were still good. For my entree I ordered the spicy chicken wings. The wings came with a side of white rice. I ordered a Thai iced tea to drink. The wings were very good, crispy and juicy. The sauce was a bit spicy. I could not find the menu online, but I think I remembered it being spicy 3. I'm not a spicy food eater, but it was tolerable. The wings were not as spicy as the entree I ordered a few weeks ago at Thai Noodle Cafe. My husband ordered the chicken curry. He also ordered a Thai iced tea. I liked the green tea flavor of the iced tea. I tried a bit of my husband's curry, but I'm not a fan of curry. My husband really liked the curry, and said it was better than the one he ordered the last time we went. After we finished our meals, the hostess brought over the check, and a fortune cookie. The fortune cookies were filled with the same fortune as my last visit to Thai Delight. I assume that the fortune cookies are left over from a New Years Eve dinner or something. I thought it was kind of odd, but it was still fun to read. I'm keeping the fortune for good luck. During our meal, more customers arrived. The hostessowner was very friendly. There were a few more tables near the back of the restaurant. I didn't notice the bathroom, but I'm sure there was one. I'm assuming that the restaurant is open for lunch and dinner. The restaurant is small, but I think they have the capacity to seat around 20 people. My husband and I had a good meal at Thai Delight. The service was friendly and fast. I think the prices are reasonable. I would go back again in the future. I think Thai Delight would be a good choice for a casual lunch or dinner. I'm looking forward to trying some of their other menu items. I'm glad you had a good experience at Thai Delight. The owner is very friendly, and they do serve good food. I think I'll have to try those crispy rolls sometime. Thanks for the review. I don't remember seeing the fortune cookies there last time. Hmmm. I think I'm a little overdue for a visit. I was really hungry by the time I arrived, and I didn't remember seeing the fortune cookies either. But I was so hungry that I probably would have eaten them if I was handed one. My friend and I ate there last night. I had the chicken curry and she had the pineapple fried rice. We both liked our entrees, but the pineapple fried rice was really good. She and I both liked the Thai iced tea.

I know it's unhealthy to eat so much, but I just couldn't stop! We ordered a bucket of 10 pieces of dumplings for RM11. The dumplings were sooooo good.

{"original_text": "I am mad that ha had to give this place even 1 star. See the old reviews were pretty good then the newer reviews are mostly bad. This place changed ownership in 2015 and so far they are not doing a good job. I tried to get a table for 6 (yes I had a reservation) and they told me that they had to wait to get a table for 14 (no reservation) first. That's right they would rather have 14 people and their whole families (small children included) wait to get seated then my party. I ended up eating at Olive Garden. The manager said he would call me back and he never did. It's just bad business to treat customers this way. I guess you don't have to treat people with respect if you can get away with it. They'll never see me again. Ate here the other night with a friend. The food was great and the service was good. The atmosphere was a bit loud, but I think that was mostly because the restaurant was crowded. I would definitely eat here again. We tried the last three dishes that are not on the menu, but are on the website. The salads were just ok, but we were happy that they had gluten free options. The homemade chips were actually pretty good. We'll be back to try more items on the menu. I really wanted to like this place. I don't like leaving bad reviews, but I just can't recommend this place. There were so many things that were just not right. My husband ordered a pasta dish that was covered in sauce that was so sweet it tasted like it was made with ketchup. I ordered a sandwich that was dried out, not even warm. The menu looks nice, but I think they need to work out the kinks. I'll give them one more try, but I'm not expecting much. I really like this place. It's my go to place for coffee. They have a lot of choices for coffee and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. I highly recommend it. I don't usually care for chain restaurants, but we were out of town and needed a quick meal. We both enjoyed our salads and the service was very good. It's a good place to eat when you're on the go. This place is fantastic! The food is always excellent. The owners are very friendly and service is excellent. We've been coming here for years. It's a great place for lunch or dinner.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "I have been to this place a few times and it's always been good but the last time I was there I had a birthday party and I had to wait for my party to start."}

The Vampyre Castle was really well done (I love Vampires) and was more intense than the Circus Clown house. Now for the main attraction: The Gates of Hell.... I was already announcing to the group that I don't want to go through this house, I'm good with the other two. Of course I was convinced into going and everything would be fine. I won't give away any of the haunts inside but I will say I had to say the safe word because I couldn't take it anymore. I've read all of these negative comments and it seems like I had the same experience as the others but I was expecting it. It is made extremely clear prior to you entering the house that you will be abused psychologically, physically, and not everyone can handle it. Even being the only one out of my group who caved and opted out I still think that this Trilogy is awesome! They do their jobs very well.

Came on a Friday night for dinner and we didn't even have to wait for a table. The place was empty. They started us off with a cup of soup each and some salad. Then the servers brought over the grill and you could pick from beef, pork, and chicken. I went with the traditional pork and beef combo. The meat was really tender and had just the right amount of marinade. The only thing is that the meat was placed in a small box and they would take it away if you didn't finish it all. I had to take some home. They also had a bunch of side dishes that you could add to your meal such as kimchi, mushrooms, bean sprouts, tofu, and of course, rice. The side dishes were pretty good, but nothing to write home about. The best part of the meal was the dessert, fried bananas. The dessert was a nice sweet ending to a perfect meal.

I am a bourbon enthusiast and the bartender was kind enough to give me a quick tour of the available bourbons, but I felt he was a bit rushed and somewhat insincere. He suggested that I might like a bourbon and water with a simple syrup for a mere 18. I was shocked that he was suggesting a 18 cocktail, so I ordered a different cocktail. The cocktail was excellent, but very small. My wife had a beer and we split an appetizer, which we enjoyed. We were somewhat surprised to see our bill for 55. We have eaten at many other restaurants in the area and the food and drink was not as good as other places for the same price. There is no question that the bourbon selection is excellent and the food is good, but there are plenty of other options in the area that are as good or better for the same price.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "My wife and I recently went to 1947 for dinner.

{"original_text": "Walked in here looking for a cute skirt for my birthday dinner. First thing that caught my attention was the really weird smell. It was like foul cleaner and BO. Totally gross. Sucked it up and looked around since they had some cute clothes. Nothing is really in any kind of order, so I literally circled the store 3 times and found skirts in different places each time. Kind of bothersome to me. I never spoke to anyone and none of the employees spoke to me. I wasn't in the mood to chitchat, but it didn't look like they approached ANY customers. So heads up for those who don't like to ask for help. Quality of fabric isn't spectacular on most garments, and seems like it wouldn't last too many washings - unless you hand-washed it perhaps. The dresses are pretty cute, though, and I may come back to try some on for a wedding in the future. On second thought.... I don't want my clothes to smell like the store. Scratch that. Um....

{"original_text": "Wife an I was there last night, the band was playing they were so so, but the people that were there were dancing and having fun...So we thought this looked like a good place to stop an get a bite to eat. So I had the 2 pc. chicken dinner which came with mashed potatoes an gravy, corn an rolls. The chicken was some what greasy but the mashed potatoes an corn was good. The wife had the 2 pc. catfish dinner, she said the fish was greasy an didn't taste good. Well the waitress ask if we wanted to order another drink, the wife told her we had a bottle of water, an she said to us we didn't order that. We told her no we didn't, but we were drinking it, she said we couldn't do that. So we ask her to take it off the bill an she said no, she said we ordered it. We told her no we didn't, the wife ask for the manager. So she said, well go to the bar an ask for him. So I said if you can't take it off the bill an you don't have a manager, I'll go to the bar an pay for it myself. So I walked to the bar an paid for it. I was so mad that I had to leave my dinner, I wanted to walk up to the stage an ask the band to stop playing, because I couldn't see straight anymore. I told the wife to forget the dinner, we needed to get out of there. So if you like to have a good time an listen to a good band, this is the place. But don't eat the food. We were looking for a place to eat on a Sunday night. The server was very friendly and the food was delicious! We ordered the prime rib dinner and the seafood platter. Everything was fresh and the salads were huge! We had a 24 hour layover in Santa Maria and were looking for a place to have a quick bite to eat. We came across the Nipomo Inn, which had good reviews and looked to be a fun place. The bartender greeted us right away and we ordered a round of drinks and appetizers. My husband ordered the salsa, which was very tasty. My appetizer was the nachos, which were very good, served with fresh guacamole. We then ordered the chicken Caesar salads and they were also excellent. The portions were large and fresh. I would definitely recommend this place and the service was great. I stopped in for some lunch with friends, this place is very busy and full of locals, great place to go and enjoy a meal, the waiter was very nice and the food was excellent. I had a burger and fries and my friend had the chicken, I have to say the chicken was so good I will be going back for that next time, and my burger was great as well, I would def recommend this place for lunch or dinner. So we stopped in here to grab some lunch on our way out of town. We got there around 11:30 and were greeted by a very nice lady. The place had a casual, laid back vibe to it. It was fairly busy at this time of day but they still managed to serve us our food in a timely manner. My husband got the chicken fried steak (which he enjoyed) and I got the roast beef dip (which I loved!). It was a nice, hearty meal for a reasonable price. I'd definitely come back again. I know some people find the decor dated and I can see why. But it's fun, like stepping back in time. The food is fresh and the atmosphere is laid back. We had a nice time there. On a long road trip, my husband and I were looking for a place to eat. We saw the Nipomo Inn and figured it might be a good place to eat, and it was. The food was great, the service was nice, and they had good prices. I highly recommend this place.

I took my MOTHER here and we both loved it. She is a big fan of the mafia, gangster movies, and I was so surprised she knew about the movie \"casino\" and the true story of it. It's a great bar and great food. I mean they have real books to read there. I usually never find books that I actually want to read in bars. The bartenders are really friendly and they have a great selection of drinks. It's the only place I've seen in vegas that has a good selection of different types of vodka. My mother had to try a different type every time she had a vodka. I had the specialty drink for 10 that came in a medicine bottle with real pills on the inside. I had to drink the pills, they weren't real. It was great! I have a picture of it too. It's a little on the expensive side but worth it. The atmosphere is great and the food is really good too.

We had a reservation for 8pm, the place was completely empty at that time, and we were the only table seated for quite awhile. The hostess just stood around and didn't help with getting us seated.

We had a 9pm reservation but we were ready for a drink so we stopped by the bar. The bartender was nice and he gave us a few cocktails to start out with. We had the lobster roll and it was good.

{"original_text": "This mall has been since as long as I've lived here in Vegas. It's been through some changes over the years, but it remains clean, up to date, safe and fun. There are plenty of stores to choose from, food court and restaurants to eat at. I've enjoyed going to this mall with my family and friends for the past few years. It's a great place to shop, eat and catch up. We went to the Luxor last week, and we didn't have the greatest time. I'm not sure if it was because we were visiting during the day, but it just seemed like the energy wasn't there. We walked through the casino and I didn't see a lot of people sitting down and enjoying themselves. There was a show that we wanted to see, but we didn't get a chance to, but hopefully we can go back and do that. I did enjoy the outdoor area that was in the middle of the hotel. I love going here to get my hair done. The stylist have always been really nice and welcoming. They work with me to get me the right style and color that I want. I've had a few bad experiences at other places, but this one I've been going to since I was a little girl. I love the vibe here and always leave feeling happy. The original store in Henderson is actually where my parents went to get their first wedding cake. It was 33 years ago and they still remember how delicious it was. Now, we go here for birthdays or other special occasions. The cake is always good and so are the other desserts. It's a fun place to go to celebrate. I've been to this store a couple of times and they always have the best sales! I've been able to find some really nice and stylish clothes at great prices. The atmosphere is always so friendly and welcoming. The store isn't too big, but it has a lot to choose from. I love that there are stores like this in Vegas. I love going here to shop. I'm not a huge fan of the mall, but this store is always one that I like to stop in. They have really good prices for the items that they sell.

It's been through some changes over the years, but it remains clean, up to date, safe and fun. There are plenty of stores to choose from, food court and restaurants to eat at. I've enjoyed going to this mall with my family and friends for the past few years. It's a great place to shop, eat and catch up. We went to the Luxor last week, and we didn't have the greatest time. I'm not sure if it was because we were visiting during the day, but it just seemed like the energy wasn't there. We walked through the casino and I didn't see a lot of people sitting down and enjoying themselves. There was a show that we wanted to see, but we didn't get a chance to, but hopefully we can go back and do that. I did enjoy the outdoor area that was in the middle of the hotel. I love going here to get my hair done. The stylist have always been really nice and welcoming. They work with me to get me the right style and color that I want. I've had a few bad experiences at other places, but this one I've been going to since I was a little girl. I love the vibe here and always leave feeling happy.

{"original_text": "My first ever visit to the almighty XS to see what the fuss is all about would have been a much more enjoyable experience had it not been for the continuous string of DJs playing the same 10 songs over and over. I didn't arrive to the club until around 2:30 a.m., but it was already in full swing. Despite being a Wednesday night, XS was packed to the rafters with people trying to forget that they had work the next day. I arrived just in time to catch Kaskade, who was finishing his set. He looked like he was having a great time, and the crowd was really into it. The set ended with the DJ bringing out his friend and putting her on stage to sing. After that, Alesso took over for the next hour. He played a few popular songs, including his remix of \"If I Lose Myself\" by OneRepublic and his \"Let Me Feel\" remix. He also played some of his own work, which I recognized from his album, \"Swedish House Mafia Friends,\" which is a compilation of some of the best DJs, including Alesso. Next up was Zedd. He started off with a remix of his song \"Clarity,\" which the crowd loved, and ended with a remix of \"Spectrum\" by Zedd and Matthew Koma, which also brought the house down. After Zedd, the music was turned down and lights went up. DJing stopped for a bit, and the crowd was in complete shock. I didn't understand at first, but then I realized that this was the best part of the night. A sexy burlesque dancer came out and performed for the next 10 minutes. The performance was amazing. The woman was fit, and her outfits were very provocative. She wore a very small top with a skirt, fishnet tights and tall heels. After the burlesque dancer was finished, the DJs returned, but it was too late for me. I could only tolerate so many remixes of the same songs. The next day, I realized that I didn't even catch the headlining act. I've never heard of him, so I can't say how big of a deal he is. But my friends that went to XS that night said that he was pretty good. They said that he played some new songs that weren't even out yet, and he sounded pretty good. However, it was way too crowded at XS. I can't even imagine how difficult it must be to fight through the crowd just to get to the bar or the bathroom. For now, I'll just stick to the more low-key clubs in Las Vegas.

There are two main dining rooms, one on each floor. I started on the upper floor, where I found most of the tables and almost all of the other diners were asian, which is a good sign. There were also several large groups of young asian women, so it's a good place for a ladies night out. I was seated at a booth, and I asked for dim sum. I had a choice of having the waitress roll the cart to me, or having her come up to take my order. I opted for her to come over, and she was right there with pen and paper. She was also very personable, and I got the feeling that she was genuinely interested in helping me. She was very polite, and the whole transaction felt like a casual conversation rather than a business transaction. After I ordered, she thanked me and said she'd be back with my tea. I'd expected to wait a while for the tea, but she was right back. I was impressed. As we waited for the food, the waitress checked on us a couple of times, and made sure that my water was full and that I was enjoying the tea. My tea arrived before the food did, and it was very good. Not too hot, and plenty of flavor. The tea was served in a traditional handleless cup, and the saucer is the large round plate on which the food is served. The tea service was very attractive. The food arrived quickly, and was hot. We had barbecue pork buns, steamed pork dumplings, steamed chicken dumplings, shrimp pork dumplings, and steamed shrimp dumplings. All of the food was excellent. The buns and dumplings were steamed rather than fried, which I prefer. The pork dumplings had a nice sweet flavor, the chicken dumplings were excellent, and the shrimp dumplings were good.

{"original_text": "I am still just as pleased with Sonoma Grille as I was the first time a reviewed it. I would say I am up to eating here twice a month, if not more. So, here is a photo of their signature dish, shrimp and grits, which I have had about 5 times since I first tried it 6 months ago. There is no reason to change the review that I gave the first time. So, I will just give a short summary of my latest visit. I went to dinner with a friend of mine who is a very picky eater. He likes really simple, plain foods, and he doesn't like for things to be really hot or really spicy. So, he wanted to go to a nice restaurant but he didn't want anything too fancy. I thought about this for a few minutes, and I suggested Sonoma Grille because I was pretty sure they could accommodate him. I was right. We had a really nice meal together. He had the Crab Cake Benedict, and I had the Shrimp and Grits. First, he said his eggs were perfectly cooked. He said they were just as he likes them, but he also said that the eggs were very fresh and fluffy. He also said that the crab cake was full of crab, and that it was cooked to perfection. He said the crab cake had a nice flavor, but it wasn't too salty. He also said that the Hollandaise sauce was cooked perfectly, and that it was creamy and flavorful. I was pleased with my meal as well. I love the grits at Sonoma Grille because they are so creamy and flavorful. I am a big fan of their shrimp as well. I am sure they use fresh gulf shrimp, and I think they are cooked perfectly. The shrimp are never overcooked, and they have a nice flavor. I am also a big fan of the bacon in this dish. They use thick cut bacon, which is always cooked perfectly. All in all, this is a very flavorful dish, and it is not too spicy. I also had their Bloody Mary for a drink, and I really enjoyed it. The house Bloody Mary is very good, but I asked them to make it for me with hot sauce instead of the horseradish they usually put in it. I am very glad I did that because it really made a difference. This is my favorite Bloody Mary in Baton Rouge. I have tried many of them, and I still have some to go, but this is my favorite so far. I also had a dessert which is not on the menu. I asked for an off the menu dessert, and I am really glad I did. It was called a Nutella Bread Pudding, and it was amazing. I will say that our server was not the best I have ever had at Sonoma Grille, but I was still very satisfied with my meal. The other thing I will say is that I really like the atmosphere at Sonoma Grille. I love the high ceilings and the modern decor. I also like that they serve breakfast on the weekends, and they also serve lunch and dinner. They have a really nice outdoor patio which I can't wait to enjoy on a nice day. I like that they have a bar which serves specialty cocktails. I like that it is a little more upscale than most restaurants in the area. It is not at all stuffy. In fact, it is really casual and comfortable. I am really glad I found this restaurant. It is one of my favorites. I love Sonoma Grille. It is one of my favorite restaurants in Baton Rouge, and I have been going there for several years now. I have eaten there for lunch and dinner, and I have had breakfast there several times. I am very pleased with the service, and I am very pleased with the food. I love everything I have ever had there. I have had a lot of different things on the menu, and I have never been disappointed with anything. Their breakfast and lunch menus are pretty basic, but they have some really good things on the dinner menu. I think their best meal is their dinner, but I love to go for breakfast sometimes. They have a really good Bloody Mary. It is my favorite one in Baton Rouge. I also like their salads. I have had their Steak Salad, and it is very good.

Everything is pretty much perfect as always, I loved the calamari starter, the steak was very good and so was the service, I cant say enough about this place and it's quality. The wine list is unbelievable with all the regions of Italy represented and it's a place I would recommend to anyone. Il Mulino is a restaurant chain owned by Il Mulino New York, LLC. The Il Mulino restaurants are a part of an international chain of restaurants that are based in New York City. The first Il Mulino was established in Greenwich Village, New York, in 1981 by Abruzzese immigrant Fernando Gaglio, and his sons Roberto and Andrea Gaglio. The restaurant had previously existed as La Mela Ristorante and was purchased by the Gaglios in 1981. The Il Mulino menu was designed to reflect the cuisine of Abruzzo, Italy, the home of the Gaglios. The menu was developed by the Gaglios in consultation with Gino Filippone, an Italian chef from the Abruzzo region. In 1987, Gino Filippone, Roberto Gaglio and Stephen I. Sadove opened a second Il Mulino in New York City, located in the affluent suburb of Greenwich, Connecticut. In 1993, a third Il Mulino opened on Restaurant Row in New York City. In 1994, Il Mulino opened at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada.

{"original_text": "So.... although I was celebrating my 25th in Vegas..... and it was my first time- I have to say that I had a great time and I didn't stay on the strip the whole time. First off, I stayed at the Flamingo- and I loved it! I got a great deal at 65 a night and it was such a beautiful hotel. The pools were great (although I wish I had more time to enjoy them) and the food was good too. I went to the Bella Vita Italian Restaurant there and it was actually very good. I got the fettucini alfredo and I was so full that I had to take half of it home! My first night there I met up with a friend who I met online and we went to the Mirage and saw Cirque du Soleil's LOVE which was awesome! It's a Beatles tribute of sorts with the Cirque du Soleil twist. I really enjoyed it! I also liked that it wasn't so over-the-top. I guess I'm not a fan of the \"Vegas\" show in general. Then the next day I headed to Fremont Street for the Fremont Street Experience. It was amazing. I went during the day and then came back at night and it was amazing. There is a show every hour on the hour on the canopy on the street and there are bars everywhere. I had a great time and I was able to get my name on the \"Walk of Stars.\" The only thing I really didn't like was that the city is so spread out. I mean, you have to drive everywhere and if you're not careful you could spend a lot of money on taxis! So, be careful. But, I had a great time.

{"original_text": "For a place open just a matter of weeks The Spot seems to be off to a great start. We arrived to a full house on Saturday evening and settled onto some stools at the bar to enjoy a beer before a table was ready for us. The bar selection was good and the bartender was enthusiastic and welcoming. Built within an old house, The Spot is small; there were only about 10 tables and about 4-6 spots at the bar. Rumor has it there is some outdoor seating but it was a bit too chilly to take advantage of that! They aren't currently taking reservations but who knows if that will change down the road. The ambiance is quite nice; freshly done woodwork, soft lighting, and lined with black white photos on the dark red walls. If I had my choice, the best seats in the house are probably in the bar area or the booths up by the front windows. Two of the booths are right by the kitchen window which has pros and cons; some people love seeing behind the curtain and watching the action. I, on the other hand, find fluorescent kitchen lights to be my kryptonite so I'd rather stick to the more romantic corners of the space. The menu had many tempting options on it for both the vegetarian and the carnivore. Prices were reasonable and a lot sounded tasty. We started with the Baked Artichoke Remikin (6.50) which was served with pickled carrots and crusty bread. We enjoyed it thoroughly; it was a good portion for two or three. For entrees I had the Portabella stew (11) which I enjoyed and the Mister settled on the Wild Boar Sausage (14) and was also pleased.

We provided feedback on the polenta but assured him that overall they seem to be in great shape. A few minutes later, the owner offered us a complimentary dessert due to the polentapalooza. Yum! Dense chocolate cake, rich and sweet, a perfect end to the meal.

We arrived to a full house on Saturday evening and settled onto some stools at the bar to enjoy a beer before a table was ready for us. The bar selection was good and the bartender was enthusiastic and welcoming. Built within an old house, The Spot is small; there were only about 10 tables and about 4-6 spots at the bar. Rumor has it there is some outdoor seating but it was a bit too chilly to take advantage of that! They aren't currently taking reservations but who knows if that will change down the road. The ambiance is quite nice; freshly done woodwork, soft lighting, and lined with black white photos on the dark red walls. If I had my choice, the best seats in the house are probably in the bar area or the booths up by the front windows. Two of the booths are right by the kitchen window which has pros and cons; some people love seeing behind the curtain and watching the action. I, on the other hand, find fluorescent kitchen lights to be my kryptonite so I'd rather stick to the more romantic corners of the space. The menu had many tempting options on it for both the vegetarian and the carnivore. Prices were reasonable and a lot sounded tasty. We started with the Baked Artichoke Remikin (6.50) which was served with pickled carrots and crusty bread. We enjoyed it thoroughly; it was a good portion for two or three. For entrees I had the Portabella stew (11) which I enjoyed and the Mister settled on the Wild Boar Sausage (14) and was also pleased.

Where to go, where to stand, seat yourself or not, these things are not always evident. So I walk into the Trailhead Cafe, not knowing what to expect. All I know is that it marries my two favorite things: Bicycles and Food. It is Sunday morning and a breakfast sandwich soundas great. Ok Cut to the chase. I actually never ate at this cafe. I could not get sanyone to greet me, let alone take an order. I walked in slowly - trying to get a bearing on this new joint. I took the universal stance infront of the food counter, which suggest I might want to order something. A young man after a few minutes showed up behind the counter, made eye contact and did not say a single word to me. Ok - so he was busy, I never want to be that guy. He proceeds to chat with a couple of friends. I figured I would look at some of the kool bikes and let him finish. After a poilite trip around the shop (on my part), I went again to the counter and took that universal pose of I am ready to order now. 2 or 3 people walk past me, and not a word. I figured, I was not part of the Trailhead scene and sheepishly made my way for the exit. 15 minutes wasted and still no food or drink. Now - I know that this must be an anomalie as fellow yelpers like this joint. I gotta say that this put a bad taste in my mouth (really no taste at all). I will probably go back and give it a try. I hope I have a better experience. This definately falls under the category of a hasty response, but hey businesses go down all the time because of this type of negligent service.

It was the most impressive meal I've had, not just because of the food but because we were served by a TEAM. There was the bread guy, the busser guy, the wine guy, and the main server. They could not have been more polite, attentive, or friendly. thinking we were jsut getting tastes of wine parings for each dish, we started out with a bottle of white but we sure didn't need it - each pairing was a full glass of the most perfect wine. The wine guy (our own personal sommolier) gave a description of each after pouring, and the only complaint was that he was soft spoken so we had a hard time hearing him. They were all probably a bunch of adjectives anyway, we're not wine snobs so we didn't care too much. I had to try real hard not to till up with each dish, knowing there was more to come - 8 dishes in all. God, it was SOOOOO good. After that I was so full of wine and stuffed with incredible food I just went back to our hotel and zonked out!;-P For anyone looking for a memorable dining experience, there's lots of celebrity chef restaurants out there but this one was really worth it.

You should try to get them sealed so that the air conditioning isn't wasted. Also, the windows in the lobby have several dings and scratches in them. You should fix them. The same for the scratches in the walls. The floor of the lobby isn't leveled very well. The wallpaper is a bit crooked in places. There was some crap in the hallway.

{"original_text": "After hearing how terrific the food and atmosphere are at Tornado Club, I was eager to try it. I had the 8 oz filet and my girlfriend had the queen cut of prime rib on a recent Saturday night. Even though the restaurant is listed as wheelchair accessible, it was difficult to turn the sharp corner into the bar from the front door and if the bar is busy, it's nearly impossible to negotiate my large power wc between the vintage barstools and excessively large booths. Also, the well-worn marble in the doorway needs to be replacedit forms a large, uneven surface which further complicates a difficult entryway for a wheelchair-using patron. My steak was good, if slightly undercooked from my medium request. The hash brown were greasy and overly cooked and my underwhelming barley mushroom soup was heavy on the former while the latter was nearly non-existant. My gf's prime rib was tasty, but the cut was particularly thin and excessively fatty compared with other restaurants in Madison. Overall, Smoky's still rules in my book and perhaps it's impossible for any steak house to live up to the kind of love the Tornado gets from it's devotees. It just didn't do it for me and Smoky's doesn't make you choose between soup or salad (both are included) and each include a relish tray and breadfor pretty much the same price. For me though, the flavor of my steak wasn't as good as Smoky's and it was disappointingly undercooked. I'm probably like most diners who don't go to the trouble to send it back, not wanting to wait or make a fuss.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "After hearing how terrific the food and atmosphere are at Tornado Club, I was eager to try it.

{"original_text": "I'm going to write one last review on FastMed, as if the two previous ones weren't clear enough. Yes, I had an incredibly horrible experience there...fine, lesson learned. I found a new primary care physician and moved on. But I was shocked to discover that FastMed had added a 200 charge to my credit card for an overdue bill. I was not aware of this, because they never even contacted me to tell me that they were charging my card, or to tell me that they were sending my \"unpaid bill\" to a collection agency. A few days after I left my final review, I discovered that FastMed had been charging my credit card on a monthly basis for the past 6 months. I couldn't believe it. So, I called the collection agency, explained the situation, and asked that they please remove the charges. \"We can't do that, it's FastMed's mistake.\" Oh, so I'm expected to pay for a 200 mistake? Is that how that works? So, I called FastMed, and I spoke with a manager who was incredibly rude, arrogant, and unprofessional. I explained to her that they had been charging my card without my permission, and I was shocked. She told me that I signed a waiver that allows them to do that. Well, I never signed any waiver, and even if I did, that doesn't make it right. She also told me that I was rude to her, and that she would be happy to put me on hold, while she and her staff have a good laugh at my expense. She then hung up on me. I called back, and she refused to speak to me. So, now I'm stuck, and I'm not sure what to do. I guess this is one of the downsides to the new health care system, but honestly, I don't know what to do. They don't care, and they're not going to help me, and I don't know what else to do. So, I guess I'll just pay the 200, and I'll never step foot in there again. But I will tell everyone I know to stay as far away as possible. I know they're not supposed to be there for emergencies, but I didn't know that when I went, and I was just desperate to get some help.

{"original_text": "I am not usually a fan of buffets but before heading to Las Vegas I took some time to read about several places that were of note, especially within my hotel.

For example; look at the above mini eggs benny!? Each table was given a large glass bottle of Aquahealth water and of course unlimited coffee, juices etc and if you paid a bit extra, unlimited mimosas, bloody mary's or champs! I am a sucker for miniature versions of things..the takeout boxes they put the asian cuisine in were no exception. Also offered: korean bbq, miniature fried chicken drumsticks that come in your own little fryer basket, prosciutto pizza, duck confit ravioli with sage (sweet and savory perfection) beet and arugula salad and so much more. I loved that even though it was morning there were excellent lunch options which I sampled without holding back (it was for research!) Other dishes of note: the chicken apple sausage was heavenly, mini croissants, hash, fruitcheese bar, sausage station in general, asian fusion area and a carving station.

This recent experience, they forgot to clean the dashboard (dust, dust and more dust) it was very unpleasant. I had an excellent experience at this location! Thank you so much for providing such great customer service. Good experience except my windshield washers didnt work. The staff at this location was very friendly, informative and quick. They did a great job of explaining the service and why it is recommended. They did everything quickly and professionally. I didn't have to get out of my car. I was able to get in and out quickly, and the staff was friendly and courteous. The service was fast, friendly, and reasonably priced. I have never been to a Valvoline before, but if I had to guess from one experience, I would go there again. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. They showed me everything they did as they did it. They were quick and efficient. The service was great, quick and easy. They were all very nice. I've been using Valvoline Instant Oil Change in Lake Orion for a number of years and have always been satisfied with the service I have received. Everyone was friendly and professional. They got me in and out quickly and it was nice that they went over what they did with me. Professional, courteous, and friendly. My usual location was closed so I went to a different one. I was a little worried I'd have a bad experience. I was wrong. It was great! I have been taking my vehicle to Valvoline for over a year now and have been satisfied with the service every time. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Everyone was professional and friendly. No issues. The customer service is great, as well as the knowledge of the staff. No reason not to, I would recommend Valvoline to everyone I know! The technicians were very pleasant, polite, and knowledgeable. They answered all my questions and showed me the new oil filter. I will go back there when I need an oil change again. They did not offer me a discount coupon. The manager was awesome. She was super personable and very professional. I'll definitely return for my next oil change. Your staff is very professional and courteous, always a pleasure. I've been going here for years. I like the fact that there is no appointment necessary. I am usually able to get in and out in about 20 minutes. The staff is always friendly and explain things in a manner that I understand. This was my first time visiting the Valvoline in Lake Orion. They did a great job and I will definitely be back! I came in for an oil change, but they were out of my oil. I had them use the next best thing, but it was more expensive. I have been a customer for years at the Lake Orion location. You have always been courteous and your staff is very professional. I am glad I had you do a headlight replacement. The guy did it very quickly and it looks great. I will definitely be back. I was highly satisfied with the service.

Staff was great, I didn't feel pressured to purchase anything else. I'm a single mom and I don't have a lot of money for vehicle repairs. I didn't feel like I had to spend money I didn't have. I can only afford the oil change. The employees are extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Friendly staff, well done service, and they didn't pressure me for other services. I have always received excellent service. They are very knowledgeable and friendly. The service was great, the guys were funny and the service was quick. Everything was quick, easy, and informative. Excellent customer service, friendly staff, competitive pricing, quick service. Ever so much faster than the dealership. This is a great location. I always get excellent customer service.

The meatball sub was also very good. The staff was very pleasant. I did not go through the drive thru but my friends that did said that the person at the window was very nice. This place is on my list of places to go back to. Love their pizza! I will be honest I have never been there and just ordered take out. But it's delicious and I can't wait to try some of their other food! We had a terrible experience here today, I wanted to order a pizza for my kids to eat before their baseball games. We called in our order and were told it would be ready in 20 minutes. 10 minutes before the games started, we called in to see where our food was, they told us we would have it in 10 more minutes. 30 minutes later we decided to pick it up because we had games to get to, when we got there the girl at the counter was talking to her friend and we had to wait to order. When I asked about the pizza she told us it had just gone in the oven and would be another 10 minutes. When it finally came out, there were no drinks, she went to get them, took a long time, we were late for the games, and I went to pay for the pizzas and the girl said we had been charged extra for cheese and told me to ask my husband what we ordered, which I did, he said he didn't ask for extra cheese. Then she charged me for 2 drinks for my 2 kids, when I told her I was only given one, she told me that was why I was charged for 2, I told her I only had 2 kids and I could only use 2 drinks and I wanted a refund, she gave me the refund but I will never go there again, the girl at the window was very rude and the whole experience was very unpleasant, especially since it was my kids first time playing in their baseball games.

The chips tasted like they were fried in old oil, and the guac had a flavor that certainly wasn't guac-licious.... more on the verge of going bad.

I suppose if you really wanted to avoid the lines at the buffet and didn't mind shelling out for each glass of juice you wanted this would be alright.

This last trip for lunch sealed the deal for me and I will not be back. The first floor was about 13 full so it was not too crowded. We were a party of 4. Two ordered burgers and two ordered ribs. One ordered an appetizer that came with the meal instead of before the meal. The worst part was that it took 50 minutes to get our food and once it arrived for two of the people, it took 5 more minutes for the other 2 to get their food. The burgers were tasty as was the cornbread. The ribs were way overcooked and dry and had a slightly burnt taste. My guess is that they were cooked significantly earlier and then reheated on a grill. My collard greens were tough and too salty to eat. Not once during our wait did anyone come by and let us know that the kitchen was behind. No one ever asked how our food was after the wait.

{"original_text": "On the disappointment scale, Italian Grotto ranks right up there with my never getting laid by my first girlfriend, whom I now know twenty years later is a lesbian. Three entrees and I sampled all of them. The marinara dipping sauce was heavy with tomato paste and not at all a good marinara. The clams swam in a broth so salty, it made my lips swell up like a pontoon boat. The fried calamari and artichoke were fried to a delicious, white coloration which, in the realm of fried foods, was about fourteen hues down from golden brown. This created confusion in my already befuddled mind. Was it cooked or wasn't it? I Had to take a bite to solve the mystery. Unnerving. I ordered an antipasto for two thinking I'd go light with meats, cheese, and relishes. Another huge disappointment. It looked like a salad with two buried slices of capicolla deep within and two, also buried, slices of salami. The remainder of the bowl was small bits of red and yellow peppers, about thirty pepperoncini, but mostly romaine tops. This was anything but a traditional antipasto, with the majority of the bowl comprised of lettuce. I don't know why IG hides the meat and cheese, but it pissed me off. I felt like the catcher in a game of hide the salami. Literally! I had to ask for bread since the antipasto was a bust. This made me feel like Oliver Twist begging for crumbs, and for no good reason at 12.95. The only thing good about this place was nothing.

In the hour I listened to the service managers conversations with the customers that were picking their vehicles up, I heard him tell several customers that he had done more work than they had authorized and charge them up to twice what they had been quoted. It was necessary and required for safety reasons. Same crap has been pulled on me and I know better now. I just don't trust them, to the point where I checked my oil that day to see if it had really been changed. It had been."}
{"original_text": "Exhausted after a long day of tradeshow-ing, cab lines and not winning a million bucks. It's 8:30pm and we are in line waiting to get into the Wicked Spoon buffet. I'm hungry, my feet hurt, and I am tired. But I will wait in line. I'm just not sure if I can wait this long. Five years ago, my husband and I decided to leave our jobs and take a 12 month around the world vacation. One of the goals we had was to try and be as adventurous with food as possible. After a month in Sydney, we flew to New Zealand. We got there on December 23rd and had a month to drive around the North Island in a camper van. In addition to our list of sites to see, we also had a list of restaurants we wanted to try. It's not a secret that New Zealand has a thriving restaurant scene. Chef Peter Gordon, of London's The Sugar Club and Providores, was born and raised there. He is credited as being one of the first people to introduce fusion food to the UK. We were excited to see if he had influenced any of the chefs we were going to see. Kinloch Lodge was a must on our list. It was a two hour drive from the town we were staying in, and we had to make reservations well in advance. When we got there, the dining room was intimate, warm and cozy. It was a chilly evening and the fire was blazing. The first thing we noticed when we sat down was the variety of servers. They were all young, and they were all dressed in different outfits. It was like they were all going to prom. One of them even had on a tuxedo. We ordered wine and then the parade of food began. The first dish was a warm puffed pastry with a creamy whipped pate. It was salty and smooth and crunchy. The second dish was a fried piece of eel, served on a bed of mashed potatoes. My husband ate it and then looked at me and said, \"That's the first time I've ever eaten eel, and I'm not sure I ever want to eat it again.\" The third dish was lamb. This was different than lamb we had seen in Australia, which was more like a thick roast. This was cut into small pieces, and cooked medium rare. It was served with a red wine sauce. Then came the salad. It was a green salad, and it was the perfect antidote to all the rich and heavy dishes we had just had. It was light and crunchy and refreshing. The cheese course was a selection of three cheeses. One was an aged cheddar from New Zealand, and I can't remember what the other two were. But they were served with dried fruit and nut bread, and a glass of port. Then came dessert. We shared a mango sorbet and a chocolate tart. The sorbet was just the right amount of sweet and tart, and the tart was rich and decadent. We were done. This was a wonderful meal. The service was great, the ambiance was warm and relaxing, and the food was amazing. We left feeling very full and very happy. We went back to the camper van and drove back to our hotel. I was so tired that I fell asleep on the bed while my husband finished unpacking. When I woke up, it was 1:30am. \"What time is it?\" I asked, looking at my watch. \"1:30,\" he replied, \"Why?\" \"I'm hungry. I just want to go to a restaurant and eat a burger.\" \"Fine,\" he said, \"But I'm not going with you.\" So I got dressed, and I walked to the restaurant next to the hotel, and I ordered a burger and fries and a glass of beer. And it was wonderful. I don't think I've ever had a better burger, or a better fry. And I was so happy. I'd had the best meal of my life, and the best burger and fry of my life. I think you can have both. Labels: Kinloch Lodge, New Zealand, The Sugar Club, Wicked Spoon Kimberly Atkinson January 25, 2013 at 1:07 AM Very true!

{"original_text": "Two words. ALMOND CROISSANT. It's huge [insert'that's what she said' joke here] and has a good amount of almond filling. So I would try to split it with someone as a snack, or order it with a beverage if you are eating for breakfast. It's a good hearty meal, especially for those that need to keep their blood sugar up. I didn't take pictures of my food, so I'm stealing some from the web. I got the Belgian Waffle. It came with a choice of blueberry or strawberry preserves and whipped cream, which I ordered on the side. This was one of the best waffles I have ever had in my life. It wasn't too heavy, it wasn't too fluffy, the outside was crispy and the inside had a soft, chewy texture. The preserves and whipped cream added a nice sweetness to the waffle. I've had the Eggs Benedict here before, but the last time I went, I wasn't in the mood for eggs. I ordered the Sausage and Peppers with hash browns. The sausage was cooked perfectly, and the peppers and onions were cooked well and were flavorful. I got the Steak and Eggs, and had them cook the steak medium. My friend ordered the Steak and Eggs, and they cooked the steak well-done. He said it was a little chewy, but overall it was still tasty. The service here is always great, and I've never had to wait for a table. They are also open late, so if you have a craving for breakfast food at 2am, they have you covered. I'm so glad I'm not on a diet anymore.

To their credit, things went well for about an hour until we were ready for our entrees when we waited...and waited...and waited. Our server walked back and forth, observing my impatient posture and look but never once came over to let us know Oh hey, guys...your entrees will be right out!

The mignonette was my fave condiment for the oysters while the yummy dijonnaise was best for the mussels. The mussels were so good, we ordered another dozen! Cauliflower Soup - topped with fried capers; very rich and creamy and cauliflowery. The capers did much to provide an additional dimension to the otherwise 1D soup. Beet Salad - Red beets topped with some fruit, half crispy with small seeds (like a kiwi). Refreshing! Duck Confit - Served atop halved roasted brussel sprouts. The duck was pure and game-y, as duck confit should be as it's cooked in its own fat. I encouraged my hubby to pick up the bone and gnaw off the crispy parts. Magnificent. Croque Monsieur - served with shoestring fries; appropriately rich with the sauce and sunnyside egg on top but not overly salty like other versions I've had. Gnocchi a la Parisienne - I decided on this dish thinking it would be lighter and make up for all the food we had beforehand. Boy, was I wrong. First off, these aren't potato dumplings. They are pan-fried herbed flour dumplings sauteed with fennel, eggplant and other stuff. I thought it was delicious but the oil at the bottom of the dish indicated it wasn't the light fare I expected. At this point, the 5-6hr drive to Vegas overtook us so we bypassed dessert and requested our check. We realized maybe a long dinner wasn't ideal after we've been on the road for so long!

{"original_text": "Visited with my mother one evening, as Appian Way has been her fave restaurant for many years. It is hard to respect a restaurant that serves cold butter in foil! My dinner started out with the house salad, which was a generous helping of lettuce with cucumber slices and sliced grape tomatoes. I like that they use actual grape tomatoes, rather than the little cherry tomatoes that seem to be the standard with salads. The salad dressing is the standard Italian dressing, but it is really good. I have to say that the most memorable part of my dinner was the toasted garlic bread. I wish I would have been able to buy some to take home with me. My dinner consisted of their Chicken Parmesan. It was a generous portion of chicken that had a nice crispy exterior and a good, hearty marinara sauce. I think I would have been satisfied with just the marinara sauce as an entree. My mom had the traditional Shrimp Scampi. We both had mashed potatoes and broccoli. The broccoli was so good that I would recommend it as a side with anything. I know that it is just broccoli, but it is very tasty. I did not go into the bar area to see what they had to offer. I will have to visit during the day to sample their lunch menu, which is different from their dinner menu. I am sure I will return to sample the toasted garlic bread with some of their other menu items.

{"original_text": "Okay place, but watch out for the bar tenders who do funny math and ask you if you are sure that you want your change back. I suppose those are'typical college bartenders' and not the norm. Also, watch out for the guy who comes around at the end of the night and tries to take your drinks that you bought and left at the bar, even after you have told him that they are yours and to leave them alone. All that being said, it's a fun place to go to to hang out and listen to some good music.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "If you are looking for a fun place to hang out and listen to some good music, then you might want to consider going to the Red Bull Bar."}

{"original_text": "I came into a wealth of free bagel cream cheese bagel coupons, so I finally got a chance to check this place out. I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but I'm not going to turn down a free meal either. I tried to go once before but they close at 5pm on Sundays. The sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read 6 but the bottom left-hand corner of the 6 was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a 5. I finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese. The bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket. The jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal. The people working there were friendly and accommodating. The main hangup was that the worker didn't offer to toast my bagel and, me thinking this would be standard didn't ask, left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel. After I took one bite I really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel. In NYC you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy, but this one was a bit tough to swallow. I feel a conflict of interest when giving them only 2 stars since my bagel was free, but it'll have to remain at 2 until I get my next bagel (also gratis) before the coupon expires.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "I came into a wealth of free bagel cream cheese bagel coupons, so I finally got a chance to check this place out.

{"original_text": "I don't understand what is the hype about this place. Based on the ratings, I decided to try it myself. I got the chicken and waffle breakfast and my husband got the man vs. food house special. I was surprised by the portion because their hella huge. Its like a meal for two. I am a big fan of chicken and waffle breakfast but I was not impressed with theirs. First the waffle was soggy so I asked for the waffle to be crispy. When it came back to me, it still wasn't crispy but the server said that's their crispy. I asked for it to be almost burned. I waited patience and started eating my chicken. It was actually good. But reminded me of southern style chicken. I don't care much for it. When the waffle came back, it still was not crispy. So I just gave up on it. I think my husband had the andy's sage fried chicken. It a bunch of stuff on a place. I don't even know where to explain. For me it was ALRIGHT. I would eat it but it was just too much to finish. On the other hand, my husband (who is a chef) did not care for it at all. So that was a total fail. Would I do back again? Probably not.
