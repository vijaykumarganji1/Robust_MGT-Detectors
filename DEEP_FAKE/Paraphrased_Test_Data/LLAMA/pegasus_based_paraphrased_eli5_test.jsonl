{"original_text": "The comments about pus being a byproduct of infection and inflammation are quite right, although it's worth remembering that the creation of pus is specifically related to clearing infection from the body. The body doesn't make pus unless it has an infection to fight off. Pus is in essence an extremely powerful immune system chemical. It's not dangerous to the body at all, even though it might look and smell bad to the untrained eye. Pus is a non-specific immune response. It's the same stuff the body makes whether the infection is in your lung, your brain, or your foot. The medical community doesn't really know how the body makes pus, but it's most likely related to some sort of localized cell death in the body. It's formed from dead white blood cells and the cellular debris they leave behind. The body can make pus from just about any kind of tissue, but it's especially common to see pus in the lungs, the liver, and the spleen. These organs are often the targets of infection, and they also tend to be the ones that generate the most waste and debris. In any case, the pus that gets released is actually a very useful byproduct. When pus gets released, it's usually a sign that the body has identified an infection and is starting to fight it off. Pus itself is a collection of powerful antibodies that the body has made in order to fight off the infection. The pus is made up of antibodies that the body is making specifically to fight off the infection, so it's a very valuable biological tool. It's one of the reasons we don't worry too much about letting small cuts heal on their own. The pus that forms in the wound is actually good for the body. It helps clear the infection and start the healing process.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "In a recent interview with the BBC, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that pus is \"a byproduct of infection and inflammation\", and that it's \"not dangerous to the body at all.\""}

{"original_text": "Major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) like AT T and Verizon are actually required to provide wholesale access to their DSL network services for the purpose of allowing other smaller third-party ISPs to compete in the market and offer their own internet service to customers. This is how companies like [DSL Extreme] (URL0) are able to offer internet service to customers throughout the United States in both AT T and Verizon regions. However, in the United States, the FCC regulations that mandate this type of wholesale network access only apply to basic ADSL service offerings. This means that companies like AT T and Verizon only have to provide smaller third-party ISPs with access to 6-8 Mbps DSL lines to customers. Obviously this presents a problem because most major ISPs now offer much higher bandwidth ADSL2, VDSL, cable, or fiber services that are much faster. As a result, these smaller third-party ISPs can't really compete with the DSL lines they can rent from AT T and Verizon which are both low-bandwidth and costly (the wholesale rates in many cases exceed retail rates for the equivalent service offering by the major ISPs). So, there is a regulatory system and framework in place designed to drive competition in the market, but it's completely ineffective at this point because the service offerings are just so bad in comparison to the major ISP offerings. Other countries like Canada and the UK have solved this problem by: 1. Forcing ISPs to open up their broadband networks for wholesale access, including ADSL2, VDSL, Cable, and Fiber networks 2.

{"original_text": "It depends on the team really. Sometimes it's just random stuff and sometimes it's changing the play or pointing this out to the offense.,I don't think any of these answers are ELI5... Pretty much every team can change little things about the play they called right before they run it (start the play). So for example, if they call the play, get to the line, and see something on the defense that would counter the play they called, they can yell \"OMAHA\" which is a codeword to change something in the play, which will be better suited to counter what the defense has setup. I'm sure they have some random words that they throw in that do nothing to fakeout the defense if they think the defense knows their keywords and such. Defense has the same thing aswell. Codewords which change their plays and stuff.','Everyone's touched on the main idea. Essentially you should walk away knowing that the words aren't literal. They're codes. They're codes only that team knows. If you yelled out, \"Hey Steve, go that way!\" then the other team would know where Steve was going. If you yell out \"Foxtrot Uniform 72!\" and it means the same as \"Steve, go that way!\" then Steve will do that - except the other team won't really know it. Unless, somehow, they figure it out. But they have to figure it out on the field, because taping another team or watching them practice to get those things is against the rules. Possibly even illegal.','Usually a color-number \"green 57, green 57\" is just the QB's cadence before he calls for the ball to be snapped. The same QB will usually have the same cadence, and just vary the number of times he says it to keep the defense guessing. Other times he'll call out the middle linebacker \"52 is Mike\" so the offensive line knows the center point of the blocking scheme. Occasionally you'll hear key words like \"razor\" \"ringo\" \"lasso\" which may sound arbitrary but are actually called audibles and are changing the play called in the huddle. Sometimes words that start with an L or R tell the offensive line to shift the blocking scheme above to the left or right, respectively.

Sometimes it's just random stuff and sometimes it's changing the play or pointing this out to the offense.,I don't think any of these answers are ELI5... Pretty much every team can change little things about the play they called right before they run it (start the play). So for example, if they call the play, get to the line, and see something on the defense that would counter the play they called, they can yell \"OMAHA\" which is a codeword to change something in the play, which will be better suited to counter what the defense has setup. I'm sure they have some random words that they throw in that do nothing to fakeout the defense if they think the defense knows their keywords and such. Defense has the same thing aswell. Codewords which change their plays and stuff.','Everyone's touched on the main idea. Essentially you should walk away knowing that the words aren't literal. They're codes. They're codes only that team knows. If you yelled out, \"Hey Steve, go that way!\" then the other team would know where Steve was going. If you yell out \"Foxtrot Uniform 72!\" and it means the same as \"Steve, go that way!\" then Steve will do that - except the other team won't really know it. Unless, somehow, they figure it out. But they have to figure it out on the field, because taping another team or watching them practice to get those things is against the rules. Possibly even illegal.','Usually a color-number \"green 57, green 57\" is just the QB's cadence before he calls for the ball to be snapped. The same QB will usually have the same cadence, and just vary the number of times he says it to keep the defense guessing. Other times he'll call out the middle linebacker \"52 is Mike\" so the offensive line knows the center point of the blocking scheme. Occasionally you'll hear key words like \"razor\" \"ringo\" \"lasso\" which may sound arbitrary but are actually called audibles and are changing the play called in the huddle. Sometimes words that start with an L or R tell the offensive line to shift the blocking scheme above to the left or right, respectively. Sometimes they indicate a completely different play to be run, or to change the direction of the current one, or even direct just one or more of the receivers to run a different route.

{"original_text": "Long story short, the ransomware utilises two main exploits in Windows systems, known as EternalBlue and DoublePulsar. These were leaked by a Russian hacker group known as'The Shadow Brokers' in April, after they stole them from the US National Security Agency (NSA). EternalBlue is a vulnerability in Windows' Server Message Block (SMB), a file-sharing protocol, which was patched by Microsoft in March. However, many organisations, including NHS Trusts, had not installed the update, or had been slow to do so. DoublePulsar is a backdoor implant that provides covert and unauthorised remote access to a system. Initially, the attackers behind the ransomware demanded around 300 worth of Bitcoin, but this later doubled to 600. The ransomware also contained a link to a site written in the Tor browser, which required the victim to register their ID number in order to unlock the encrypted files. WannaCry has been described as the most widespread cyberattack ever, and although it hasn't actually spread as much as other viruses, such as Conficker, the impact has been greater. This is because it has targeted core services, such as healthcare, and the security services have warned that the attack could potentially be a precursor to something more serious. \"This is a relatively new type of malware, and one that has wreaked havoc in several countries, including Russia, Ukraine, Spain, China, Italy and the UK,\" said David Emm, Principal Security Researcher at Kaspersky Lab. \"It infects the computer by exploiting a vulnerability in a server message block (SMB) service. This is a file-sharing service that presents an opportunity for the malware to spread between computers on the same network. The malware then locks the files on the computer, and displays a message that demands a ransom to unlock them. Victims have been instructed to pay between 300 and 600 in bitcoin.\" Since the initial attack, Microsoft has issued a patch for Windows XP, which it had stopped supporting in 2014. However, even if this doesn't prevent the malware spreading, it can limit the damage. As Emm explained, \"Microsoft has now released a patch for Windows XP users, although this patch will only work on systems that have not been rebooted since the outbreak began. If an infected system has been rebooted, then the patch won't work. That said, it's still worth installing the patch as it will stop the ransomware spreading to other systems.\" Whenever a major cyberattack occurs, it's only a matter of time before a wave of cybercriminals try to exploit the public's fear. In this case, the ransomware in question is the WannaCry virus. So, if you're not sure whether you're protected or not, you should take action now. \"Individuals and organisations should apply the patch released by Microsoft in March and should immediately update to the latest version of Windows. We also recommend making regular backups of all important data and storing them offline in devices that aren't always connected to networks,\" added Emm. \"Finally, users should be cautious about opening any attachments or links in unsolicited emails, even if the sender is someone they know.\"", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "The WannaCry ransomware, which has affected more than 125,000 organisations in 150 countries, has been described as the most widespread cyberattack ever, and although it hasn't actually spread as much as other viruses, such as Conficker, the impact has been greater."}

{"original_text": "There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of information available about DOCSIS 3.1 yet, but if my prior experience can lend a hand towards this question, I would venture a guess that it is possible that there are going to be some additional pieces of equipment required between the modem and the external antenna. It is possible that there are going to be two antennas and a pre-amplifier required between the modem and the external antenna. The reason for this is because in the past, when the modem was in the house, the signal had to be amplified on the way out the window, then down the cable, and finally amplified again at the antenna. In the case of a modem that is mounted externally on a pole, there is no need to amplify the signal on the way to the antenna, so there are two amplifiers that are in the way between the modem and the antenna. I have an older setup that had an amplifier mounted inside the house and an amplifier mounted on the antenna. The amplifier on the antenna was the smaller of the two amplifiers. The cable from the antenna into the house was about 100 feet, and the cable from the antenna into the modem was about 50 feet. The cable from the modem to the amplifier inside the house was about 30 feet. When I tried to connect the antenna directly into the modem, the signal was too weak. I had to add the smaller of the two amplifiers to the outside of the modem so that it would be able to receive the signal. I think the reason that it was too weak is that the modem is located about 100 feet from the amplifier on the antenna. My guess is that you will need to use two amplifiers to make this work. One between the modem and the cable and another between the cable and the antenna. The first one will be a high gain amplifier and the second will be a medium gain amplifier. If I'm wrong, I would love to see the solution that does not require two amplifiers. The modem you are using is probably designed for residential use. I doubt that it has the high output power required to drive a cable of 200 feet to an antenna. You can always try it first, but if it does not work, then you will need to add amplifiers to the system. I think that you will need to find a modem that has the correct outputs. The problem with using a modem that has the correct outputs is that it will probably cost at least 100 more than the modem you are using now. I'm not 100 sure if the modem you're using even has an Ethernet port to connect it to a router. Most cable modems that are sold at big-box stores like Walmart and Best Buy do not have an Ethernet port. It is possible that you could buy a cable modem that is capable of transmitting and receiving at the 1.5 GHz band, but it is unlikely that you will be able to find one that has the correct outputs. If you do manage to find one that has the correct outputs, it will probably cost at least 100 more than the modem you are using now. There are a few modems that have Ethernet ports that are capable of transmitting and receiving at the 1.5 GHz band. These are usually modems that are sold to businesses for around 150-200. You might be able to find one of these on eBay for less than 100, but you will probably have to look for a used one. When you are looking for a modem that is capable of transmitting and receiving at the 1.5 GHz band, I would suggest that you check out the Motorola and Netgear websites. They usually have a \"Data Sheet\" link for every product they sell that lists the specifications and features. If you find a product that is capable of transmitting and receiving at the 1.5 GHz band, the first thing you should do is make sure that it has a model number that is listed on the Comcast website. This is not something that Comcast will tell you, but if you contact their support and tell them that you are having a problem with your modem, they will tell you which modem you should use. The reason why they won't tell you this information is because they want to sell you their own equipment.

Once the peanuts are shelled they sell them at a discounted rate. They don't want to pay a full time employee to shell them, especially not in this day and age. So I'm not sure if they have a machine or if there's an easier way to shell them. Is there a safe way to shell them? I know many people just boil them for a short time, but it seems dangerous to boil them. What can you do to shell the peanuts? Would the boiling water be dangerous to the person doing the shelling? I usually put my peanuts in the microwave for a few seconds (30 to 60 seconds, depending on how many) and they usually pop right out of the shells. Boiling is dangerous to the peanuts. First, peanuts are not nuts. They are legumes. I shell peanuts by putting them in the microwave for a minute. After they have cooled, you can pop them out of the shells. If you have a metal nut cracker, the shells come right off. I put them in a 300 degree oven, in a baking pan for about 20 minutes. I put them in a plastic ziploc bag and smash them with a rolling pin.

Many parts of the body have carbonyl groups, which in the context of skin means a carbon double bonded to an oxygen, single bonded to a carbon, and single bonded to one other thing. That other thing might be a nitrogen with other stuff attached in the caste of protein, or an oxygen with other stuff in the case of fats. When a strong acid or base gets on skin, it attacks the carbonyl, and replaces the \"other thing\" with either the base, or water in the case of acid.

(What makes an acid strong is the other atoms it's comprised of; depending, some molecules will handle the resulting negative charge better than others, some molecules due to size will hold onto protons more strongly than others, etc.) Strong bases are also corrosive but they are looking to gain a proton, not donate one. Because we are comprised of organic molecules (molecules containing primarily carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen often as well as nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus), we are particularly susceptible to reacting with acids or bases because of that hydrogen transfer - and we've got plenty of hydrogens to give or plenty of places where hydrogen wouldn't mind being.

{"original_text": "There is an excellent podcast by Stuff You Should Know that is entirely about swearcurse words. They explain the history, psychology and science of curse and swear words, which are different things. It's a very interesting podcast if you like that sort of thing. To be honest I was never one for using swearwords as such, I grew up in a household where they were discouraged (Mum was a prude and Dad was a vicar) and I took this attitude with me to adulthood. I'm not a prude anymore, but I'm not particularly fond of swearing, nor do I see the need for it. I don't think it necessarily adds anything to a conversation, and I have a major problem with people who swear all the time. I once worked with a guy who swore every sentence and it drove me insane. Every single sentence was peppered with foul language. Fucking this, fucking that, oh fuck, fucking hell, fuck me, fucking hell, I hate fucking computers, and so on. I would say that over 70 of his sentences would include a swearword. It was one of the most irritating things I've ever had to endure. I think the only person who can get away with swearing all the time is Keith Richards. He is the King of Swearing. His autobiography is peppered with swearwords and he uses them very effectively. Swearing doesn't get in the way of his message, and he's not swearing for the sake of it. I find swearing in certain circumstances completely acceptable. I swear when I'm in pain, I swear when I'm angry, and I swear when I'm drunk. I'm not a big drinker, but when I'm drunk I tend to swear like a trooper. It's just how I am when I've had a few. But I don't swear for the sake of it. When it comes to swearing in the workplace, I'm not so sure. I know that when I was a project manager at BT, I swore a lot. I was in a very high stress job at the time, and swearing helped me to relieve the stress of managing projects that were difficult and stressful. I was under huge amounts of pressure and swearing was a way to let off steam. I don't think it's a good thing to be swearing constantly though, and I've worked with people who swear all the time. I never really liked that. As I've grown older I've become less tolerant of swearing and I'm not really sure why. I still swear, but not as much as I used to. I think it's partly to do with being in my 40s and not really being as 'cool' as I used to be. And I'm far more aware of my swearing now, and it's not really a good thing. I've noticed that I swear more when I'm alone. If I'm with other people I tend not to swear. I don't know why, but I can't really explain it. I think it's a confidence thing. When I'm on my own I'm not worried about what other people think, but when I'm with people I suddenly become self conscious about my language and I don't swear. I think swearing is a generational thing as well. People who are older than me tend to think it's terrible when you swear, and if I'm swearing in front of them I try to be more careful about what I'm saying. It's not a conscious thing, but I do it automatically. I'm very aware of the company I'm in, and I don't want to offend people. It's all very strange because I was once a massive potty mouth, but now I'm not. I don't know why this is, and it's something I'm going to have to think about more. I'm not sure it's a good thing to be swearing less, but I'm not sure it's a bad thing either. I don't swear as much as I used to, but I'm not sure if I should. I've become very self conscious about my language and I don't like that. I'm not going to stop swearing, but I'm going to think about it more.

It allows it in self-defense. If someone is breaking into an occupied house, there is a presumption that a reasonable person would think they intend to kill the occupants. This presumption is not absolute. Traps are normally defending unoccupied property, where self-defense doesn't work. However, even for occupied property, some jurisdictions consider them unjustifiable force. The traditional rule was that traps were justified only if a person in the same situation would have been justified in using deadly force (if you ignore that adding a person to unoccupied property makes it occupied). But that's a somewhat stupid distinction to draw. A trap doesn't know if force was justified or not. It can kill a firefighter as easily as an arsonist.

The choice to defend yourself with a weapon under your control, however, is a measured oneunder the circumstances, it may be justified to use force in your defense.

If a firefighter were to break down your door you would have the good sense not to shoot at them but a booby trap doesn't know the difference.,\" \"Outside of Texas, the law does not allow deadly force to stop a thief. It allows it in self-defense. If someone is breaking into an occupied house, there is a presumption that a reasonable person would think they intend to kill the occupants. This presumption is not absolute. Traps are normally defending unoccupied property, where self-defense doesn't work. However, even for occupied property, some jurisdictions consider them unjustifiable force. The traditional rule was that traps were justified only if a person in the same situation would have been justified in using deadly force (if you ignore that adding a person to unoccupied property makes it occupied). But that's a somewhat stupid distinction to draw. A trap doesn't know if force was justified or not. It can kill a firefighter as easily as an arsonist. So, to discourage people from trying to game the odds, the rules have been generally changed to make deadly traps unreasonable. A trap is inherently dangerous for everyone, so the law discourages it.,There was a case in San Anselmo, CA where the booby trap intended to defend an owner's garage hurt two kids. It was a shotgun rigged to shoot if someone opened the garage. As far as I am aware that was the groundbreaking case that established that booby traps are no good bc there is no \"control\" over the booby trap.', \"Because you can't simply shoot a thief in the act in any state in America.

At least it's a signal that all is well. The sneeze or sneezes are an allergic reaction or a cold or something else that causes irritation to the nasal passages. The nose is the main organ of the body that maintains internal temperature balance. When a person is exposed to extreme cold or heat, the body sends an impulse to the nose to warm up or cool down. The nose then releases a stream of fluid which is supposed to regulate the internal body temperature. The irritation causes a similar reaction.

{"original_text": "Popcorn kernels contain small amounts of water, and that water evaporates when heated, expands, and pops the popcorn. Due to variation in the water content of the kernels along with temperature and humidity, the actual amount of water in each kernel will vary. The U.S. Grain Standards Act, as amended, defines popcorn as containing between 13.5 percent and 14.5 percent moisture by weight. Our popcorn is formulated to have the optimal moisture level for microwave popping. When popcorn is in the microwave, the water inside the kernel heats up, evaporates, and builds up steam pressure. When the pressure inside the kernel is so great that it cannot hold in any more steam, the kernel pops. The ratio of kernels that pop is known as the popping percentage. It is the percentage of popped kernels compared to the total number of kernels. The popping percentage of popcorn is directly related to the temperature of the heating system and the length of time the popcorn is exposed to the heat. Each kernel of popcorn has a certain point of \"popping temperature\" when the moisture within the kernel vaporizes. If the temperature of the heating system is too low, the moisture within the kernel will not reach the point of vaporization and the kernel will not pop. If the temperature is too high, the moisture will vaporize too quickly, and the steam will have no place to go. This will cause the kernel to explode and will also prevent it from popping. The characteristics of the kernels themselves also contribute to their ability to pop. These characteristics include the size of the kernels, the shape of the kernels, the moisture content of the kernels, and the maturity of the kernels. There is a difference between popcorn and popcorn fluff. When you hear the word \"fluff,\" what comes to mind? Some people think of a little white puff of clouds or maybe a soft, downy feather. Well, popcorn fluff is nothing like that. When we say \"fluff,\" we are actually referring to the pieces of corn that do not pop. When popcorn is made in a microwave, there will always be a small amount of fluff, which is about 2 percent of the total weight of the bag. Let's compare it to when you make popcorn on the stove. When you shake a pot of popcorn on the stove, you may see some small, unpopped pieces in the bottom of the pot. That is popcorn fluff. Popcorn fluff is considered an inedible by-product of the popcorn-making process. How is popcorn fluff different from popcorn? When popcorn is made, fluff consists of the hulls of the kernels that do not pop. These pieces are considered inedible because they are hard, contain no flavor, and are difficult to digest. Popcorn fluff is not considered a food ingredient and is not allowed to be sold as such. What does popcorn fluff taste like? We will say that it doesn't really taste like anything because it is a hull from the kernel. When the kernel pops, the hull or fluff flies out of the popcorn kernel. Since there is no moisture in the kernel, it is hard and does not taste like popcorn. Popcorn fluff is also very small, about the size of a kernel of sand or a grain of rice. Where does popcorn fluff come from? Popcorn fluff comes from the hull of the popped kernel. When a kernel of popcorn pops, it becomes larger than the hull of the kernel, which is why the fluff is small and hard. What is the popcorn fluff used for? Popcorn fluff is used to add volume to the product so that the popcorn does not get stuck in the bag. Also, it is used to fill space in the bag so that the popcorn is not exposed to air for a long period of time. When popcorn is exposed to air, it starts to become stale. The popcorn fluff keeps the popcorn from becoming stale. Why is popcorn fluff not allowed to be sold as a food ingredient?

So in reality it doesn't literally offset the revenue because it's offsetting student fees that don't really exist. But he can still say \"I raised taxes X million, but offset them with a tax credit also of X million!\" It's a sleight of hand."}

{"original_text": "Our abilities to regenerate slow down. The leading idea as to why is that telomarase, a necessary chemical that's used in cell mitosis to bind telomeres together at the ends of DNA strands, becomes less and less effective as we age. Another factor is that our DNA accumulates damage over time, especially when cells divide. This damage can eventually reach a point where it prevents the cell from dividing further, which means the cell becomes senescent. Senescent cells may help us to avoid cancers, but they do nothing to help us avoid aging. Our lifestyle choices are one of the most important factors that affect how we age. The choices we make in how we eat, exercise, rest and relax, and how we handle stress all have an impact on how well our telomeres maintain their ability to regenerate. The most recent study in this area is a large study of people who are over the age of 60. Researchers found that there was a strong association between the lifestyle choices of people in this age group and how quickly their telomeres lost the ability to regenerate. Researchers found that the shorter the telomeres were, the higher the risk of death. They also found that the people in this group who exercised regularly, maintained a healthy weight, avoided smoking, and ate a healthy diet had the longest telomeres of anyone in the group. This study shows that we can slow down the aging process and help to prevent chronic diseases and early death by changing the way we live. Exercise is one of the best ways to protect the health of our telomeres. People who exercise regularly have longer telomeres than those who don't. Exercise also improves cellular health and reduces inflammation, which is good for our telomeres. Our telomeres are also affected by our weight. People who have obesity have shorter telomeres than those who are at a healthy weight. People who are overweight or obese also experience earlier onset of age-related chronic diseases and death. If you have a sedentary lifestyle, changing this is also very beneficial for your telomeres. People who sit for long periods of time during the day have shorter telomeres than those who don't. People who are under a lot of stress also have shorter telomeres. Smoking is one of the worst things you can do for the health of your telomeres. Smoking leads to telomere shortening and increases the risk of heart disease and cancer. Eating a healthy diet that's rich in antioxidants is also very beneficial for the health of your telomeres. Antioxidants neutralize the free radicals in your body, which helps to prevent cellular damage and slow down the aging process. If you want to slow down the aging process and help to protect your health as you age, make sure you're exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and avoiding a sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and stress.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Our telomeres, the ends of our chromosomes, are at the heart of how we age.

Gold, silver and platinum are soft metals. Gold is the softest of the three, followed by platinum and then by silver. Silver has a high coefficient of expansion. This means that silver expands and contracts a lot with changes in temperature. Platinum has a low coefficient of expansion and gold has an intermediate coefficient of expansion. Gold, silver and platinum are inert metals. This means that gold, silver and platinum do not react with other chemicals. This makes gold, silver and platinum ideal for use in jewelry. The metal will not react with the wearer's skin or with cosmetics. Gold, silver and platinum are ductile and malleable, but they are not very flexible. This means that gold, silver and platinum can be hammered into thin sheets and they can be flattened into thin sheets, but they cannot be bent into complex shapes like copper. Gold, silver and platinum have high densities and low coefficients of expansion. This means that gold, silver and platinum are used in dentistry. Dental fillings and crowns are made from gold, silver and platinum alloys. The alloys have a low coefficient of expansion and they do not expand or contract much with the temperature changes in the mouth. This prevents the fillings and crowns from coming loose.

{"original_text": "When you rub your eye you are mechanically stimulating your retina, causing you to see light that is not actually there. The images projected by said light are called Phosphenes, and they are a type of neuropathy (or in this case, retinopathy). A phosphene is a type of illusory perception, so it can be compared to a hallucination, and is not to be confused with an afterimage (which is a visual perception caused by the persistence of retinal image). Examples of Phosphenes If you've ever rubbed your eyes and seen lights flash, you've seen phosphenes. The experience is pretty common. In addition, there are many other ways to generate phosphenes: Stimulating the retina with electricity, or with a strobe light, or with direct pressure. Rubbing the eyeball, which can cause phosphenes to be perceived in the peripheral vision. Closing the eyes tightly, which can cause phosphenes to be perceived in the peripheral vision. Covering the eye with one hand and vigorously rubbing the eyelid with the fingers of the other. This method is called the hand-on-eye technique. Placing a bright light in front of the eyes, and then quickly covering the eyes. Placing the back of your head on a pillow and rolling your eyes as far back as possible. Stimulating the retina with a laser. A Phosphene can also be used to describe the light in the center of your field of vision when you close your eyes. This is called the phosphene of rest. Types of Phosphenes Phosphenes can be either geometric or non-geometric. Geometric phosphenes are generally simple and symmetrical, like stripes or dots, while non-geometric phosphenes are generally more complex, like images of animals or faces. In addition, phosphenes can be monocular (seen by only one eye) or binocular (seen by both eyes). Monocular phosphenes can be further broken down into relative and absolute monocular phosphenes. An example of a relative monocular phosphene is when one eye is covered and the other is exposed to light. An example of an absolute monocular phosphene is when both eyes are covered, but one is exposed to light. Binocular phosphenes are caused by both eyes being stimulated at the same time, such as when you see white spots after looking at a light bulb. Sometimes Phosphenes can be generated in the human brain even when there is no stimulation of the retina. In this case, it is called an entoptic phenomenon. This phenomenon has been shown to be a vital part of the development of the visual system in fetuses. One of the earliest researchers of phosphenes was Edmund Mach, who used to describe them as \"eye-sparks.\" They were first given the name \"phosphene\" by Johann Gaspar Spurzheim in the 1800s. The phosphene effect is used in certain medical tests. For example, the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test uses phosphenes to determine color vision deficiencies. Interesting Facts about Phosphenes Phosphenes can be created in a number of different ways, including using a strobe light or by placing pressure on the eyeball. Studies have shown that the number of different types of phosphenes that a person can see is significantly larger than the number of phosphenes that a person actually sees on a regular basis. Phosphenes can be used to determine whether or not a person is experiencing color blindness. Phosphenes can also be used in artistic works. For example, some art installations involve stroboscopic lights that cause phosphenes. Phosphenes can be used to treat certain types of headaches. Phosphenes can sometimes be the first sign of a condition called Charles Bonnet syndrome. Charles Bonnet syndrome is a condition that affects elderly patients who have lost their sight. Charles Bonnet syndrome, also known as CBS, is a condition in which patients with visual impairment experience visual hallucinations.

Konrad Lorenz (a great German Biologist who wrote The Foundations of Ethology) said that the evolution of social and communicative behaviours in mammals was associated with the relative loss of their sense of smell. Smell being the dominant sense in most non-human mammals. So, we can hypothesise that primates and cetaceans with a comparatively poor sense of smell, like the monkeys of your original question, and whales, have evolved very sophisticated, coordinated and complex facial expressions. Konrad Lorenz's work, and his founding of ethology, has been criticised in recent years, but I think his general hypothesis remains sound. I'm no primate expert, but I've done some reading on them. The same muscles that lift their lips also raise their cheeks. In addition to the lip-pursing, they are also smiling. In the case of dogs, their teeth are also exposed when they smile (we can tell because of the gap between their canine teeth). I'm guessing that they are also smiling and not just using the same muscles that lift the lips. Not the answer you're looking for?

{"original_text": "The AC is run by the engine. Just like the engine is pushing your car forwards, the engine is also running the compressor for the AC. If the AC is entirely electric, then the engine is working that much harder to charge the battery through the alternator. The engine is producing power for all of this. More power required means more gas burned. You might not realize it, but 50 MPH requires a little less pressure on the gas pedal than 50 MPH AC.', \"AC systems work by compressing a gas (freon or equivalent), and in your car there's a pump that engages to compress this gas in order to run the AC. So the pump puts some resistance on the engine, and, basically, one or 12 of the horsepower that your engine normally sends to the wheels is consumed by the AC. Thus, you consume more gasoline to accelerate to speed and drive around. Just slightly.,Part of the ac system is a compressor., this compressor compresses Freon to make coldness. This compressor has a pulley (or wheel) that needs to spin for it to operate. Your serpentine belt, attached to your motor, is what spins it. In layman's term when the ac is off it does not spin, when the ac is on, the compressor kicks on and spins. The compressor pulley does not just spin freely, it takes a little force from the belt to make it spin. This force is also like friction, so to compensate for extra loaddragfriction on the belt causes your motor to work a little harder, thus using more fuel. If you listen really closely, or watch your rpm guage, when you turn you ac on you will hear your motor (rpms) rev down for a split second from the friction of the compressor turning on. Due to modern computers your engine can sense this drag (slowed rpm) from the compressor and so the motor knows to give it a little more gas, to rev it back up, for proper idle speed','The AC compressor is turned by a belt connected to the engine. The pully on the compressor has a clutch on it. The clutch allows the pully to spin freely and not turn the compressor. This means your engine is only using enough power to spin a small pully. When you turn your AC on, the clutch engages the compressor. This means your engine is now using much more power to highly pressurize the gas used in your AC system. Your engine now needs a larger force to turn at the same speed. To generate this extra force more fuel must be put into the cylinder to generate a more powerful explosion. The more fuel your engine needs to turn at the same speed, the lower your gas mileage will be.','Where do you think the power to run the AC comes from?

If the AC is entirely electric, then the engine is working that much harder to charge the battery through the alternator. The engine is producing power for all of this. More power required means more gas burned. You might not realize it, but 50 MPH requires a little less pressure on the gas pedal than 50 MPH AC.', \"AC systems work by compressing a gas (freon or equivalent), and in your car there's a pump that engages to compress this gas in order to run the AC. So the pump puts some resistance on the engine, and, basically, one or 12 of the horsepower that your engine normally sends to the wheels is consumed by the AC. Thus, you consume more gasoline to accelerate to speed and drive around. Just slightly.,Part of the ac system is a compressor., this compressor compresses Freon to make coldness. This compressor has a pulley (or wheel) that needs to spin for it to operate. Your serpentine belt, attached to your motor, is what spins it. In layman's term when the ac is off it does not spin, when the ac is on, the compressor kicks on and spins. The compressor pulley does not just spin freely, it takes a little force from the belt to make it spin. This force is also like friction, so to compensate for extra loaddragfriction on the belt causes your motor to work a little harder, thus using more fuel. If you listen really closely, or watch your rpm guage, when you turn you ac on you will hear your motor (rpms) rev down for a split second from the friction of the compressor turning on. Due to modern computers your engine can sense this drag (slowed rpm) from the compressor and so the motor knows to give it a little more gas, to rev it back up, for proper idle speed','The AC compressor is turned by a belt connected to the engine. The pully on the compressor has a clutch on it. The clutch allows the pully to spin freely and not turn the compressor. This means your engine is only using enough power to spin a small pully. When you turn your AC on, the clutch engages the compressor. This means your engine is now using much more power to highly pressurize the gas used in your AC system. Your engine now needs a larger force to turn at the same speed. To generate this extra force more fuel must be put into the cylinder to generate a more powerful explosion. The more fuel your engine needs to turn at the same speed, the lower your gas mileage will be.','Where do you think the power to run the AC comes from? When you turn on any of the electrical systems in your car, you draw power from the engine through the alternator, ergo the engine must provide more power, which generally means increasing the fuel flow rate slightly."}

Obviously, it won't remember everything, but various significant or trivial events can be stored for a long period of time under the right circumstances. Sleep, in particular, is a time when memories can be encoded, consolidated, and strengthened. Why is this important? The answer is simple. If you want to remember, your memories must be properly encoded, consolidated, and strengthened. The problem is that sleep is not always a safe or practical option. Fortunately, you can take steps to help your mind encode its memories. Take a Deep Breath: One of the most common stress signals is the increased production of cortisol, a hormone that is associated with alertness. On the other hand, deep breathing is associated with relaxation. A study by researchers at Stanford University showed that students who took a deep breath before taking a test had lower cortisol levels. Take a Break: When you are trying to memorize a large amount of information, you may have a tendency to try to commit it all to memory before moving on to another task. While this is a good idea, it can also cause you to become overloaded with information. Take a break every so often to clear your head and recharge your brain. Don't Overdo It: One of the problems with cramming is that it can cause your brain to become overloaded with information. When your brain is overloaded, you'll find it harder to retain what you've just learned. In addition, your brain may be unable to encode the information because it is too busy trying to sort through the other information that you've already learned. Don't Study Too Late: Some of the most important memories are encoded during sleep, but this process can be disturbed if you study too late. The best time to study is just before you go to sleep. It's also best if you study in the morning, since you will have a natural break during the day. Your mind is capable of storing a large amount of information.

{"original_text": "Because historically it was a ligature (single graphics shape combining two or more letters) of two UV. And U and V was the same letter in ancient Latin. Let's start at the beginning. Latin language, as well as ancient Greek, had only consonant letters. There were no vowels. This is the reason why it is hard to write in ancient Greek or Latin without vowels. There was a need to use some extra symbols for letters. The most widely used symbol was \"E\" which is still used for the vowel \"E\" and \"I\" (long i). This symbol was used in both languages. This is the reason why Latin \"V\" and Greek \"U\" is the same symbol. When Roman Empire has been around the world, they took Greek alphabet as a standard and added some letters to it. They added symbols for new letters that was missing in the original Greek alphabet. The symbol of UV ligature was one of them. And it was used in a lot of texts. There was no need to distinguish between the letters U and V for a long time. They are not different letters in Latin, so there was no need to separate them. When the need for vowels appeared, this ligature was the first choice. And the symbol was used for the vowel \"U.\" This is the reason why this letter is called \"U.\" The symbol was widely used in the texts. And it was used in the texts for a long time. But this was not an easy task. There was a need to insert this symbol, where the letter U was needed. And it is not easy to make this ligature. This is the reason why the old texts with this symbol were very rare. But in 1524 Claude Garamond introduced a new font, which had this symbol for \"U\" and \"V.\" This was not a ligature. It was a single letter U. It was a real breakthrough in printing. And this is the origin of modern Latin alphabet. But this was not a final version of the letter. It was still not convenient to use it. It took some time to make a letter shape, which can be used for the letter \"U.\" It was similar to the symbol that we use now. But this is not the end of the story. The first font had only capital letters. And it took some time to make a font with small letters. This font was introduced by William Caslon. And he made a font, which was very similar to the one that we use now. So this is the history of the letter U. It is a very old letter. And it was used in a lot of ancient texts. And it was changed a lot of time. But it finally has a form that we use today. And it is similar to the one that was used in ancient texts. P.S.

The second does not require that there is a contract, and I can't see the relevance of the first to the second. How is the second like the first?

The video card's power is measured in the amount of RAM it has. More RAM is better, because it means the video card has more memory to store information that will speed up the rendering process. Video cards are also tasked with taking the raw data from the CPU and translating it into an image that will appear on your monitor. More RAM is better. If you are having trouble with rendering your game, try upgrading your video card to one with more RAM. The amount of RAM your computer has will determine how much data it can keep in memory at once. This is important because the more RAM you have, the more data your computer can process without having to access the hard drive, and the less the computer will slow down when lots of programs are running at the same time. RAM is measured in GB. The higher the number, the more RAM you have. If your computer is struggling to run your game, the first thing you should do is upgrade your RAM, because this will help your computer process more information at once, and will make your game run more smoothly. There are two main types of RAM: DDR and DDR2. The newer DDR2 RAM will improve your system's performance more than DDR. The hard drive is used to store data on your computer. This includes your game, as well as the data your game will generate when you play it. The more data you have stored on your hard drive, the more information the computer has to process. Hard drives are measured in GB. The more GB you have, the more data you can store. If your computer is struggling to run your game, upgrading your hard drive will not help. A 3D accelerator is a video card that takes the raw data being sent from your CPU and translates it into something your monitor can display. A good 3D accelerator will give your game better graphics, while a weak one will slow down your game. 3D accelerators are measured in MB. The higher the number, the better your 3D accelerator is. If you are having trouble running your game, try upgrading your 3D accelerator to one with more RAM. DirectX is a series of APIs designed to help programmers create 3D graphics. The more recent versions of DirectX are better at displaying 3D graphics, so a game designed for a new version of DirectX will display better graphics than a game designed for an older version. DirectX is measured in version number. The higher the number, the more recent and powerful it is. If you are having trouble with graphics, try upgrading your DirectX to the most recent version. \"Not Enough Ram\" means that your computer does not have enough memory to run your game.

Each computer has an address that is like a house address, which helps you find the right computer. But once you're there, the computer has thousands of service windows, like an ice cream truck or drive through window. They all have different numbers, but those numbers correspond to the things you want to do. For instance, if you want a web page, you go up to window number 80. If you want to send an email, you go to number 25. If you want to pick up your email, you go to window number 110. If the computer doesn't offer that service, it might just shut that window, or leave it open, but not staff it. If, however, the computer does want to serve you, there will be a person at the window.

A clone of the person will stay at the original window for the next customer. At the new window, you can tell the person what you want. They may ask you to prove who you are and that you are allowed to get it. If that checks out, they just start giving you the web page or whatever you wanted.

{"original_text": "How often do you think that happens? Any competent naval architect know perfectly well what's going to happen when a new ship is launched. They will have tested the model in every way possible - including a scale model launching with the same hull shape. The question is why did they do it anyway? There are several possibilities, but one of them is that they were trying to protect the reputation of the designer (not unheard of) by having the model tested. The designer could then say \"Look, the model has been tested and it was fine. It's not my fault if they didn't get it right at full size.\" The model may have been tested as a way to determine the effect of the different materials used in the full sized vessel. The shipbuilder may have proposed some changes to the material and used the model to test the changes. Or the model could have been the result of someone saying \"Why don't we see what happens when we launch it?.\" It's quite possible that they didn't intend to do the launch at all until the ship was actually ready for launching and they'd forgotten to test the model. Reactions: Jan, SirRobert, Captain Lhurgoyf and 5 others On the matter of whether the wreck was destroyed, I think that the main issue is that the wreck site was lost. The remains of the ship were found in 1971, and at the time there was no evidence to show that it wasn't Vasa. The conclusion that it wasn't was based on a number of factors, including the size of the hull. The hull of the wreck is only 38 metres long, while the hull of Vasa is 40.5 metres long. The hull of the wreck is shorter because the bow and stern are missing, and the remains of the bow have since been found. That means that we know where the wreck is, and there is evidence to suggest that it is Vasa. What we don't know is what the remains of the hull might look like if we excavate it. The museum's position is that the wreck should be left where it is, and if we have to excavate it then we should do so very carefully. There are also practical issues because the wreck is in the middle of the harbour, and it would be difficult and expensive to move it. Reactions: Jan, SirRobert, Jimsky and 1 other person It's possible that the model was tested to see how the ship would behave on the slipway. Ships built on a slipway can move down the slipway when they are launched, because the keel slides in the grease that is used to lubricate the slipway. It's possible that the model was tested to see what would happen if the ship slid down the slipway and the bow struck the water before the stern. I don't know why they did that, but I don't think that there is any indication that the model was tested to see what would happen at the launch. There's a lot of water in the harbour, so it doesn't look as if the model was actually launched. I think that it was probably just towed out to the harbour to see what would happen. Reactions: Jimsky and SirRobert I saw the Vasa ship at Stockholm in 1989 and was amazed at how large it is. Here is a photo of me and a friend in front of it. What I found more amazing is how well preserved it is. Thanks for the info. That's the kind of insight that you don't get in the museum. I'm not sure if they actually tested the model to see what would happen, but it's possible that they did. A great shot of the Vasa, her stern is massive. Reactions: Jimsky, SirRobert and LittleRob I see that the stern is now a bit less massive than it was at launch. Well, they had to reduce her in order to get her out of the water and into the museum, or she would still be at the bottom of the harbour. I've been to the Vasa museum, it's a fantastic place. Great pics, thanks. It's a great place to visit - it's a brilliant museum and the ship itself is amazing. A lot of the ship has been restored, and it's now possible to see how she would have looked when she was completed. It's also possible to go on board the ship, and that's a great experience.

{"original_text": "I don't know the exact route to Grand Cayman, but aircraft from the US can and do fly over Cuba. So do some private aircraft. Cuba manages their own airspace, but there is an agreement with the FAA to allow these flights. I haven't seen this addressed, but it sounds like the flight might have been in Cuban airspace. If it was, then that would explain why Cuba might be willing to hand over the recording. The FAA would be privy to the flight plan and, if I'm correct, Cuba would have been notified, as well. I have seen a lot of misinformation about flight plans and other items such as the difference between filing a flight plan and filing a notification of a flight. The flight plan is what you file with the FAA when you fly outside the US and is required for safety reasons. The notification of a flight is the information that the FAA provides to other countries about the flight plans that are filed. There are also some misconceptions about \"Cuban airspace\" I have seen around here. All of the airspace over the Caribbean is international airspace. No country controls it. Aircraft can and do fly anywhere in it. What Cuba can do is provide surveillance of air traffic in their airspace. While there are a few countries that do not recognize the FAA and require aircraft to file a flight plan with their country, Cuba is not one of them. The FAA is the only body you need to go through. Well, yes, but you have to understand that some of us are \"Lost\" fans, so we are always looking for alternative explanations. And you have to understand that some of us don't watch Lost so we don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about. I would think that most of us have seen the show, and the \"alternative\" explanation that was given to the plot of the show (to make it seem like they crashed) was the explanation I was going with. I thought it was an excellent show, even though it was a little too \"Lost in Space\" for me. I haven't heard from my Cuban contacts, but I did find this interesting blog post about the Cuban authorities reacting to the plane crashing in the ocean. \"At 1:24PM EDT, the Cuban government issued a notice to mariners warning them that \"an unidentified aircraft crashed into the sea north of Cancun,\" Mexico. The notice did not mention that the plane was a U.S. government aircraft, but it was sent to all ships and aircraft in the region. The Cuban warning says that the plane was about 18 kilometers (about 11 miles) north of Cancun at a position about 80 kilometers (about 50 miles) off the coast of Cuba.\" I would think that most of us have seen the show... If you're going to assume that, you should probably start another thread and be sure to title it something like \"Only those who have seen the TV show Lost can understand this thread.\" This was a perfectly good thread until you hijacked it with your weird references. I've given my opinion of the show in this thread, but I'm not going to start a thread about it. Oh, and I've seen some of your \"weird references\" in other threads. I'm still puzzled as to why so many seem to think that it was Cuba that reported it to the FAA. The blog article linked above is not that confusing. It sounds like it was the Cubans that reported the crash to the FAA. If they didn't know it was a US government plane, then why would they think that the FAA would be interested in the crash of a private plane in their waters? My puzzlement is with the people who seem to think that it was the FAA that reported the plane crash to the Cubans. It was the Cubans who reported the crash to the FAA. The report was that it was a crash in Cuban waters. This would make the FAA interested, as they would have to notify the Coast Guard, which is the organization that deals with the search for missing ships and planes in US waters. I'm still puzzled as to why so many seem to think that it was Cuba that reported it to the FAA. The blog article linked above is not that confusing. I think it's the \"Cuban warning\" that's confusing people. A warning is typically something that is sent to people who might be in danger.

{"original_text": "Your body knows when you aren't receiving visual information. If you aren't seeing anything, you can't experience a disagreement between what you feel and what you see. You can't experience a disagreement because you have no visual information. You're only receiving touch, which is what you feel. It's very important to understand that touch and feel are the same sense. Feel is the interpretation of touch. We think of feel as being emotional, and touch as being physical, but they are the same sense. Your body thinks touch and feel are the same thing. Visual information is only a part of what your body is getting. It's not even the most important part. The most important part is the sense of balance, which is the most important sense. You can't live without a sense of balance. Balance is what allows you to stand upright, which is a very complicated process. The nerves in the feet sense the position of the body and relay that information to the brain. The brain, in turn, calculates what the body needs to do in order to maintain balance. The muscles then respond accordingly. This is an automatic process, which goes on all the time, every second of every day. The sense of balance is a part of proprioception, which means \"self-perception.\" Proprioception is not something that most people are familiar with, but it is a very important part of how your body works. It is a part of the inner ear that tells the brain the position of the body. It gives your body a map of where you are in space. It also gives you a sense of where your body is in relation to the floor and gravity. It's an important part of how your body keeps its balance. When you have a cold or flu, you'll experience a sense of disorientation. You feel as if you are going to fall. You feel as if you are about to lose your balance. Your inner ear is not functioning properly because you are sick. It doesn't receive accurate information. Your inner ear can't tell you where your body is, so you feel as if you are falling. You feel as if you are losing your balance, and you are. It's a sense of disorientation, a loss of balance, a loss of inner balance. The sense of balance is one of the most important senses that you have. It's not just about balance. It's also about movement. If you can't feel how your body is moving, then you can't move it properly. If you can't feel how your body is moving, then you're not going to move it in the right way. If you can't feel how your body is moving, then you're not going to use the right muscles. If you don't know how your body is moving, then you can't move your body properly. The sense of balance is one of the most important senses you have. It's an important sense because it controls all other senses. If your body is not moving properly, then your senses are not going to be functioning properly. If your body is not moving properly, then you're not going to be able to feel properly. You're not going to be able to see properly. You're not going to be able to hear properly. You're not going to be able to smell properly. Your body is not going to function properly if your senses are not functioning properly. That's why the sense of balance is so important. If your balance is off, then all of your other senses are going to be off. If you can't feel how your body is moving, then all of your senses are going to be off. If you can't feel how your body is moving, then you're going to have a very difficult time with your senses. You're going to have a very difficult time seeing. You're going to have a very difficult time hearing. You're going to have a very difficult time smelling. Everything is going to be off because everything is connected. Your sense of balance is the most important sense. It is the sense that controls all of the other senses. If your sense of balance is off, then all of your other senses are going to be off. It doesn't matter what your eyes see if your ears can't hear. It doesn't matter what your eyes see if your nose can't smell. It doesn't matter what your eyes see if your mouth can't taste.

The omnivores win out when food is fairly scarce and thus being able to eat whatever is more important than being good at eating a particular thing. When food is plentiful, carnivores that specialize in hunting are going to outcompete ones that can eat the occasional bunch of veggies."}

The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed in the mid-1800s for typewriters. In 1980, researchers at the University of Utah tested the Dvorak keyboard against the QWERTY keyboard and found that the Dvorak was indeed significantly faster and more efficient. This is an alternate keyboard layout used on some Mac computers. The QWERTY keyboard is the most popular type of keyboard used for computers and other electronic devices. And the QWERTY keyboard was designed to slow down typists, because the early typewriters were slow and prone to jamming when the keys were hit too quickly in succession.

The film master is much higher resolution than even HD video so it can be scanned to a high-resolution digital file and used to make a new HD version. I have one of the earlier ones from Criterion (dvd) and it looked excellent, though it was a few years ago now. The extras and booklet were also quite good. The only one that comes close to the quality of the Kurosawa films is the Ran release. I thought the Ran release was the pits and I'm talking about the bluray release here. The transfer was very blurry, there was a lot of ghosting, and the color grading was very harsh and unappealing. I still don't understand why they chose to do that. I have the Ran blu ray, it's really impressive with great colours. I was surprised how good it looked when I got it, but I've only watched it once. I'm gonna have to give it another viewing. I watched Ran last night, the quality was not that great. I was expecting a lot more. I was disappointed with my Ran blu ray as well. I tried to like it but I couldn't. There is just too much grain, and I don't think the color grading was right. I know it's not exactly Kurosawa, but I got the My Neighbor Totoro blu ray and I must say, it is a wonderful transfer and the color grading is perfect. I wish the Ran blu ray was as good. I will also say that the sound on the Ran blu ray is fantastic! That's exactly why I got it, the sound, but the quality is poor. The sound is great, but the quality is so-so. I bought it for the extras, but I was a little disappointed with them as well. I just don't like it very much. I will say this though, the film looks great, but the sound quality is horrible. It's a shame they can't get the quality of the sound to match the quality of the picture. The Ran DVD I have looks really good.

Stomach acid can destroy microorganisms, it can also facilitate the breakdown of proteins. Hydrochloric acid can also support the absorption of minerals and the digestion of nutrients. When the stomach acid is deficient, or low, a number of problems may arise. Weak stomach acid can lead to nutritional deficiencies. Adequate stomach acid is necessary to absorb many nutrients such as folic acid, calcium, magnesium, iron and B12. It also leads to problems like chronic candida, nutritional deficiencies and food allergies. Low stomach acid can lead to hyperchlorhydria. When the stomach pH is too high (above 4) it allows bacteria to grow. When these bacteria grow in the stomach they produce their own acid and can lead to ulcers. Low stomach acid can lead to dysbiosis. Dysbiosis is an overgrowth of bad bacteria in the intestines. Dysbiosis can be responsible for many different diseases, but it has been directly connected to certain food allergies, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, eczema, acne, arthritis, asthma, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and autoimmune diseases. Another reason why stomach acid is so important is that it is an important part of the immune system. It helps prevent pathogenic microorganisms from entering the body. Low stomach acid can lead to higher incidences of food poisoning and other infections. So if you have problems like heartburn, acid reflux or any of the health problems listed above, you might want to look into your stomach acid levels. Most people are not aware that there is such a thing as having too little stomach acid and that this may be the cause of their problems. You can do a simple at home test to determine if you have adequate stomach acid. 1. Eat a meal that contains protein. 2. Wait 1 hour and then drink one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in 8 oz of water. 3. If you have adequate stomach acid you will belch within 5 minutes. 4. If you do not belch within 5 minutes you may not have enough stomach acid. There are also a few other symptoms that might indicate that you don't have enough stomach acid. 1. If you crave sweets. 2. If you have a sour taste in your mouth after a meal. 3. If you have problems with wheat products. 4. If you feel tired after eating. 6. If you don't get hungry when it is mealtime. 7. If you crave salt. 8. If you have acne. 9. If you have an intolerance to lactose. 10. If you have a skin problem like psoriasis or eczema. If you are low in stomach acid you can take a number of different steps to increase the amount of hydrochloric acid you have. One way to increase stomach acid is to make a tea using chamomile, lemon juice and honey. You can also try taking a bit of licorice root before a meal. Another option is to supplement with betaine hydrochloride and pepsin (called HCl). These can be taken in supplement form and are widely available. You can also take the herb Gentian. So if you have any of the problems listed above, consider low stomach acid as the cause. The best way to find out what is causing your symptoms is to see a doctor who can run some simple tests.

{"original_text": "Neuroscientist here. There's a staggering amount of misinformation about dopamine floating around in popular culture. The truth is, dopamine is just a neurotransmitter: a chemical that neurons use to send signals to one another. Here's a little primer on what it does, and what it doesn't do. Our bodies make lots of different kinds of neurotransmitters. They are not, as many people seem to think, different drugs that we can take to make us feel differently. They are, instead, the raw materials of thought and emotion. Dopamine is only one of several important neurotransmitters. Others include acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin and GABA. All of these molecules have particular functions, and they work in concert to create our mental experience. Dopamine is not \"the pleasure neurotransmitter.\" Nor is it \"the love molecule.\" To talk about dopamine as if it's some kind of drug, or a magic bullet that cures all our ills, is to confuse a chemical with a feeling. Dopamine is a chemical. Feelings are far more complex than that. Here's what dopamine actually does: it helps us stay focused on important goals and motivates us to make them happen. Dopamine does this by linking a stimulus (like a piece of chocolate, or a nice paycheck) to a reward (like eating the chocolate, or feeling good about getting the paycheck). Whenever you do something that furthers one of your goals, you're reminded of the reward that you'll get for reaching that goal. You feel a surge of dopamine when you're reminded of the reward, and that motivates you to keep going. This is why it's so hard to stay on a diet: you're constantly bombarded with images of delicious, tasty food. Every time you see one of those images, your brain remembers how good that food tastes, and that reminder causes a spike in dopamine. If you're trying to quit smoking, you may notice that your cravings are more intense whenever you're around other people who are smoking. The smell of smoke reminds you of the way you felt when you were smoking, and that reminder causes a surge of dopamine. Dopamine is not a drug. It doesn't make you feel good, or bad. It's just a chemical that helps you remember why you should do something, and motivates you to do it. The same is true of every other neurotransmitter, too. The more you learn about the brain, the less mysterious it is. The next time you see someone talking about dopamine as if it's some kind of drug that makes you feel good, I hope you'll share this post. \"Our bodies make lots of different kinds of neurotransmitters.

{"original_text": "Those formative years are when the brain writes its own software for how to remember things. Only after that software is written can you start to retain long-term memories.', \"This is a good time to be learning how to do things, because you can retain that information for your entire life, and you never know what's going to be useful.\" When you're young, your brain is like a sponge, ready to soak up knowledge and skill. And you can keep your mind open and spongy, even when you're older. However, that doesn't mean older people can't remember things or don't remember as well as younger people. \"The idea that older people don't remember things as well as younger people is true, but that's not necessarily because older people don't remember things as well as younger people,\" Dye says. \"Older people do remember things as well as younger people; they just forget them faster.\" To keep the sponge intact, keep it wet. Exercise your brain in the same way you exercise your body. \"It's a matter of using it, or losing it. That's true for your mind as well as your muscles,\" Dye says. \"If you just sit around and watch TV, that's not exercising your brain. But if you're constantly working at learning new things, you're keeping your brain in shape.\" And, Dye says, you don't have to be in school to keep your mind active. You can do it on your own. \"The more you try to learn, the better you'll remember things,\" he says. \"Reading is important. If you like to read, that's great. If you don't, there are plenty of things on TV that are worthwhile. I'm not talking about soap operas, but TV shows that are informative. But even if you don't read or watch TV, if you just try to learn new things, you'll remember them better. \"The more you learn, the better you remember. The worse you do at learning, the worse you remember.\" Dye says learning new things is much like learning old things. \"Learning is a matter of making connections between things,\" he says. \"Those connections are called 'memories.' The more connections you can make, the more memories you have and the better you remember. \"It's not like there's a little notebook in your head, and every time you learn something, it goes in the notebook. That's not how memories work. Memories work by making connections between things. \"For example, when you were a kid, you were probably told to learn the name of the first president. You might have learned that the first president was named George Washington.

The Yulin Dog Meat Festival takes place each year on the summer solstice, and this year, it falls on June 22. \"The Yulin Dog Meat Festival is not a traditional celebration of any kind. It is a celebration of violence and cruelty,\" Humane Society International wrote in a recent petition addressed to the Yulin Party Secretary Sun Zhengcai. \"We believe that you must know that there is no place in modern China for this sort of event. We hope that you will use your power to bring an end to this event and to the mass slaughter of dogs at Yulin.\" According to ABC News, the Yulin Dog Meat Festival has been held for the past five years in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The festival is believed to have originated in the 1990s, when dog meat traders in the region formed a business alliance and decided to celebrate the summer solstice with a festival. Dog meat is a delicacy in some parts of China, but the practice is largely unpopular. In fact, the World Health Organization has reportedly condemned the practice, since there is a risk of spreading rabies and cholera when dogs are killed and eaten. The Humane Society International is calling for an end to the festival. According to the petition, 10,000 dogs are killed for the festival each year. \"The animal rights group is urging China's Minister of Agriculture to intervene to stop the mass killing of dogs for the festival. The group said in a statement that the Yulin Dog Meat Festival is not a cultural event but a celebration of violence and cruelty,\" NBC News reports. In 2014, a new law was passed in China that mandated that animals be stunned prior to slaughter. However, according to ABC News, the law has not been enforced in Yulin, where dogs are commonly beaten to death with metal clubs before being skinned and cooked. Ricky Gervais, the British comedian, has also made a video calling on Chinese authorities to put an end to the Yulin Dog Meat Festival. \"It's not a celebration,\" Gervais said. \"It's a crime against nature.\" Chinese officials have spoken out against the festival, according to NBC News. A man who runs a dog meat restaurant in Yulin told the BBC that he wouldn't participate in the festival anymore. \"It's a food festival, it has nothing to do with dog-eating,\" the man said. \"I'll stop selling dog meat. I know the dog meat festival is not good for my business.\" However, an official with the local government has defended the festival. \"It is not illegal, and the majority of people in Yulin are in favor of the festival,\" the official said. \"It's just a normal part of Yulin culture.\" At this point, it's unclear if Chinese authorities will step in and put a stop to the festival.

{"original_text": "Sharks generally don't rely on eyesight to hunt. They use electroreceptors to sense when a living animal is near by and a sense of smell for deadinjured animals. Shark's eyesight is not good, but they can tell the difference between light and dark. The green eyeshine that we see when sharks surface at night is from the tapetum lucidum, a mirrored layer that increases the eye's sensitivity to light. The eyes of sharks and rays are large and very different from other fishes, with similarities to the eyes of the other jawed vertebrates (amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds). Most fishes have eyes that are positioned on the sides of the head, but sharks have eyes that are placed on the front of the head, giving them binocular vision (like humans and other land animals). This gives them a better view of their prey, and a wider range of vision, but they still have a blind spot in front of their nose. The eyes of sharks and rays are similar to those of other jawed vertebrates, in that they have an iris (the circular ring that determines the size of the pupil), a cornea (a clear dome that covers the iris and pupil), lens, and vitreous humor (a gelatinous substance that fills the cavity behind the lens). In the eyes of sharks and rays, the lens is not rigid but changes its shape to focus the light on the retina. Sharks and rays lack a diaphragm (the muscles that allow us to expand and contract the size of our pupils). The large eyes of sharks and rays are protected by a thick layer of fluid, called a vitreous humour. This gelatinous fluid is almost the same density as the water in the ocean, so it does not change the shark's ability to focus when it enters and leaves the water. Sharks and rays have a thick cornea (the clear part of the eye) that protects their eyes from damage. Most fish have a thin cornea that has a high refractive index (a measure of the degree to which the cornea bends light passing through it). The thick cornea of sharks and rays has a lower refractive index, so it bends light less than the cornea of other fishes. This makes it less likely that light rays will be reflected inside the eye, which can lead to blurred vision. The shark's retina contains a layer of photoreceptors, which is composed of two types of cells: cones, which help us to see color, and rods, which help us to see in dim light. Sharks and rays have mostly rods, which give them good vision in dim light, but they have very poor color vision. This explains why they are attracted to shiny metallic lures, which are very obvious in dim light, but they are not attracted to brightly colored lures. Sharks have well-developed olfactory organs located in the nasal cavity. They have an ampullae of Lorenzini, which is a system of sensory receptors, placed in small pores around the nose that detect electrical signals in the water. Ampullae of Lorenzini can detect electrical fields in the water that are produced by the movement of other animals and by the location of food, even if it is buried under the sand. This helps the shark to find prey and to avoid predators. Most sharks have several rows of sharp teeth. The teeth are replaced throughout their life by new teeth that develop in rows behind the existing teeth. Teeth are used for catching, holding, and tearing food. Some sharks have teeth that are flattened and adapted for crushing shellfish, and some sharks have teeth that are flattened and adapted for scraping algae from coral reefs. Some sharks have teeth that are adapted for catching fish. The upper jaw is wider than the lower jaw, which gives them an overbite. When a shark dies, the teeth are the only bones that remain. The teeth are usually found lying on the bottom of the ocean floor, but the teeth of prehistoric sharks are sometimes found in rock formations. Many sharks and rays have elasmobranch electroreceptors (ampullae of Lorenzini) in their snout and jaws. These receptors detect electrical currents in the water, which helps them to locate prey and avoid predators.

{"original_text": "It is called evaporative cooling, and it is the same reason that your body sweats to keep cool. Think about solids, liquids, and gases. You have to add heat to a solid to change it to a liquid and to a liquid to change it to a gas. As the water evaporates it takes the heat energy from the surrounding air to change it from a liquid to a gas. This makes the surrounding air cooler. Another advantage of this kind of system is that the air is naturally humidified. There are no fans involved so the noise is minimal. Also, the energy consumption is minimal since no fans are involved. However, they can be a little expensive to install, and the pump is run by electricity. In the summer, you could grow some plants in your greenhouse. Place them in the sunniest spots. As they transpire the moisture from their leaves, they cool the air. You could also install a dehumidifier. When it is running the air will be cooler. Just make sure to use one that is energy efficient. Growing plants in your greenhouse will help make it cooler in the summer. They transpire moisture through their leaves, and this will cool the air. Just make sure to water them in the morning or late afternoon. This will give them time to dry off before the sun sets. Make sure you don't keep your greenhouse closed on hot days. This will keep the heat trapped inside. A great way to do this is to have one door always open and one always closed. This will create a natural airflow. You could also install a ventilation fan if it is necessary. Some greenhouses will have a shade cloth to keep the sun out in the summer. Others will have a plastic film. It is a good idea to have this on the roof. It will keep the sun out so that the heat doesn't build up. It will also keep the heat from escaping at night. If you use a shade cloth, make sure that you have a screen mesh to keep the insects out. You could also have a pergola installed. This will keep the sun out, but it won't block the airflow. It is a good idea to have vents or windows that you can open and close. This will allow you to control the ventilation.

So if you make 8926 (the brackets have raised over time), you would pay the tax on 1256 in the 12 bracket and the rest in the 22 bracket. Now, that does not mean you pay 12 on the first 1256. You pay 10 on the first 922, 12 on 256 and 22 on the rest. So, you can see that it is not 12 of your income that you pay taxes on. Where did you get the idea that you pay 12 of your income in taxes? You pay 12 of each bracket amount. You pay 10 on the first 922, 12 on 256 and 22 on the rest. So if you were paying 12 of your income in taxes, that would be 8926 0.12 10671.40 That is not what you pay. Sorry, I was reading a tax chart that was made a few years ago. So, if I make 8,926 I will pay 10 of 922 12 of 256 22 of 7,748 2,687.48? OK, so 10 of 922 is 92.20 12 of 256 is 30.72 22 of 7748 is 1712.16 And that gives you 2681.18. I put in a few extra cents. So, in the first bracket you pay 10 of 922, in the second bracket you pay 12 of 256, and in the third bracket you pay 22 of 7748. I see. I was thinking that the 10 and 12 were both separate brackets. So, if I were to make 9,000, I would pay 10 of 9,000 which is 900.00? Not quite, it is 10 of the first 922, plus 12 of the next 256, and 22 of the rest, which is 7748 - 922 - 256 6560.

{"original_text": "Well, you should first know that the song you gave us is a [four chord song] (URL2), which uses one of the most common chord progressions in popular music. Second, the song's melody is primarily in a [pentatonic] (URL0) scale, which is an almost universal scale that is found in many cultures. You only have 5 unique notes to choose from. Third, the melody nicely applies [tension] (URL1) and release evenly throughout. What this means is that there are some notes that sound like they naturally belong there, and if you use a note that is off from it, it feels satisfying when it finally leads to the relaxing note: this is called tension and release. So when you hear the melody line and come across a note that isn't relaxing, you subconsciously anticipate that the very next note will be the relaxing one. Fourth, the melody in the song is highly structured. The pattern is made up of simple short \"phrases\" that call on each other. For example, at 0:53, the structure is simple ABAB'. That is, there is a phrase A, and B answers A's call. Then then A comes up a second time, you expect B to show up again; but now it's slightly modified in a \"twist,\" so we call it B'. This ABAB' pattern then gets repeated 4 times! You hear the A phrase a total of 8 time over 40 seconds. Basically, this song is a very very \"typical\" song, which is why you feel like you can predict its melody.', \"Music is a medium that usually has some rules about what sounds good after a particular sound. For example, if you're listening to the radio and a song contains the notes E, F, then F, or any other 3 half-steps in a row, most people would immediately think something was off. When you listen to enough, you recognize the patterns at the very least subconsciously. And when you hear enough, those patterns begin to form. In most modern music, music theory is used extensively part of which is the theory of note combinations in a series. Like the above example, because that doesn't fit in well with music theory it would sound so completely off. I dead with music a lot, and study music more often than listening to enjoy, and it's very rare when I'm listening to a new song and I don't recognize the pattern.

Fourth, the melody in the song is highly structured. The pattern is made up of simple short \"phrases\" that call on each other. For example, at 0:53, the structure is simple ABAB'. That is, there is a phrase A, and B answers A's call. Then then A comes up a second time, you expect B to show up again; but now it's slightly modified in a \"twist,\" so we call it B'. This ABAB' pattern then gets repeated 4 times! You hear the A phrase a total of 8 time over 40 seconds. Basically, this song is a very very \"typical\" song, which is why you feel like you can predict its melody.', \"Music is a medium that usually has some rules about what sounds good after a particular sound. For example, if you're listening to the radio and a song contains the notes E, F, then F, or any other 3 half-steps in a row, most people would immediately think something was off. When you listen to enough, you recognize the patterns at the very least subconsciously. And when you hear enough, those patterns begin to form. In most modern music, music theory is used extensively part of which is the theory of note combinations in a series. Like the above example, because that doesn't fit in well with music theory it would sound so completely off. I dead with music a lot, and study music more often than listening to enjoy, and it's very rare when I'm listening to a new song and I don't recognize the pattern. I hope this helps!"}
{"original_text": "Well, first of all, there's tons. The most famous and amazing examples of ancient architecture were left by the African civilization we call'Egyptians'. So, you say, okay, but they were Africans, therefore they aren't white. And I say, oh, yes, they were, indeed. They had a darker skin, yes, but were never black, and were culturally as 'white' as we'd understand it today. Their culture was indeed originally African, and not Indo-European, however, they were influenced by the Indo-Europeans and later became a part of the Indo-European culture. Today we'd call them a mixed race people, a black and white mix. They've been conquered by the Arabs in the 7th century, and became what we'd call today a black race. A black race with a white history. Their genetic history is a mix of African and white genes, a mix of black and white culture. What you call 'white history' is nothing but a way to describe something that is not black, to put it very simple. What was the first 'white' culture, and the first 'white' history? Well, that's a good question. Let's take a look at the old world. It's old. We know that. But how old is it? The only way to answer this question is to look at the remains of human culture, and to put those remains in a time line. This is what archaeologists do. And that's how we know, for example, that the Egyptians built their pyramids some 5,000 years ago. The ancient pyramids of Egypt are still standing today, but it's impossible to know how they were built. The technology we use today would never build such monuments. The question is: How could they build them, without the technology we have today? Did they simply have a different technology? How different could that technology be? How different could their mindset be? Their pyramids are tombs of their kings, we know. They took a long time to build, and were built on the other side of the Nile, to be transported over the Nile on a barge. The building blocks are huge. There is no written history, no books, not even hieroglyphs, that tell us how they did it. The Egyptians were African. They were not black. They were white. They were not as white as we are today, but they were white. Their culture was not African, it was white. They had no written language, but they had a spoken language. If we could understand their spoken language, we'd understand how they built the pyramids. But we can't. So we don't. If we could understand their spoken language, we'd understand why they built the pyramids. Amazing structures. Huge. Massive. Solar clocks. They were built according to the stars, the sun, and the moon. Without technology, without metal tools, without the wheel, without the written word, they built something that we can't even imagine. Their minds were so much different than ours. Their culture was so different than ours. How could they do it? How could they build the pyramids, without the technology we have today? Well, the answer is simple, and it's not that they didn't have the technology. They had it, it just wasn't like our technology, not at all. So, what is technology? The short answer is: It's the 'hardware' we use to realize a certain purpose. The long answer is: It's the whole collection of the 'hardware' we use to realize a certain purpose. The realization of a certain purpose implies the fulfillment of a goal. The fulfillment of a goal implies a higher purpose. A higher purpose is the very meaning of life. But what is the very meaning of life? What is life, anyway? To be honest, it's a mystery. It's a mystery, but we have the answer. Life is the question, and the answer is death. Or rather, life is the death. The death is the meaning of life. When you realize that, you'll understand the pyramids. The pyramids were built to serve a purpose.

A moose can weigh 1500 pounds and stand 7 feet tall. That is a lot of meat. One winter in Alaska, I had to go out on the frozen river to get some firewood. I was following tracks in the snow. I thought they were from a dog, because there were four paws and it was going in a straight line. Then I realized that it was a moose, and I was following it. The moose turned around and saw me. We both had the same idea. We both wanted to turn around and go back in the direction we had come from. There was a lot of slipping and sliding. I was going to get some firewood, but I was also a lot more careful about where I walked. This is a bull moose. Bulls have large antlers and are dangerous. This is a bull moose. Bulls have large antlers and are dangerous. They will not hesitate to charge. Bulls also have a tendency to become aggressive during the rutting season, which is in the fall. The rule of thumb is to stay at least 50 yards away from any moose. If you have to get closer, you should move slowly and speak to the moose in a friendly tone. You will probably not be in a position to tell the difference between a friendly moose and one that is ready to charge. It is best to just stay at least 50 yards away. This is a black bear. They are very large and can run 35 miles per hour. This is a black bear. They are very large and can run 35 miles per hour. They are not aggressive, but if you surprise them, they will charge. If they do, you need to get out of the way quickly. You need to leave the bear room to retreat, because the bear is probably just trying to get you to leave him alone.

There are two main methods of structuring a jazz solo. It's a really good middle ground between having enough beats to explore the chord you're on on the progression while also being a small enough number that our brains can handle them and not get lost. I'd like to take you through how to structure a jazz solo and how to decide how many beats to play on each chord on a progression. To do this, we're going to use a simple jazz blues in F to demonstrate. You can play along with this backing track, and then once you've practised it, read the analysis below. Let's play through this jazz blues chord progression. In the 1st 4 bars of the blues, we play a 12 bar blues in F. The key stays the same on this section. So we have 4 chords to play over. F7, Bb7, F7, Bb7. The 2nd 4 bars of the blues is a turnaround back to the 1st 4 bars, so we're playing over the same chord progression but in a different key. This is a great way to keep the solo interesting. The 12 bar blues is the most important section of the blues to get right, so play this section as you normally would, and then when you get to the turnaround, you can really let loose with some more interesting ideas. We can see that the 2nd 4 bars of the blues are played in the key of Bb. Bb7, Eb7, Ab7, Db7. Once again we have 4 chords to play over. How to Structure a Jazz Solo If we wanted to structure a jazz solo over this blues, we could think of it in terms of the chords we're playing over. So we have 8 chords to play over. F7, Bb7, F7, Bb7, Bb7, Eb7, Ab7, Db7 We could play 16 bars of solo over this, with each chord getting 2 beats of the bar. If we wanted to be more relaxed, we could play 16 bars of solo over this, with each chord getting 3 beats of the bar. If we wanted to be more advanced, we could play 16 bars of solo over this, with each chord getting 4 beats of the bar. As you can see, playing over more chords means there's more to keep you interested, and playing over fewer chords means it's easier to keep your solo more melodic and memorable. For this example, let's play a 12 bar blues in F, and then a 12 bar blues in Bb, with each chord getting 3 beats of the bar. We're going to play over 12 chords. We can break up this solo into 2 sections. The first 4 bars of the blues is a 12 bar blues in F.

I was thinking of this the other day. It occurred to me that there is no time when it is NOT boiling. The moment it is on the stove, it is boiling. It just doesn't LOOK like it. We have to wait for that. The truth is, God's love is always there. It's just that sometimes it doesn't look like it. The pot of water isn't boiling. There are no bubbles. The water is still. We are not seeing the changes that are coming. But it doesn't mean that God's love isn't there, or that the water isn't changing. It is just that we have to wait for it to look different. We have to wait for the signs that it is indeed changing. Like in the story of Lazarus. Jesus says to the disciples, \"I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe.\" He was glad he wasn't there, because he knew what the end result would be. The disciples didn't. They had no faith. They saw a dead man. They didn't see the end result. But Jesus knew. He knew what was coming. He knew that He was about to change the world. He was about to show His glory. He was about to do a miracle that no one could deny. He was going to bring a dead man back to life. He was going to change the face of the world. He was going to make a way for people to truly know and believe in Him. He was going to redeem all of us. I was listening to a sermon recently, about how we need to learn to wait. Waiting is hard. Waiting is scary. Waiting feels like nothing is happening. But sometimes we need to wait. We need to trust. We need to believe. We need to have faith. We need to know that God is always there, even when He doesn't look like it. He is there, even when it is silent. He is there, even when we are afraid. He is there, even when we feel alone. He is there, even when we are hurting. He is there, even when we are angry. He is there, even when we are grieving. He is there, even when we are confused. He is there, even when we are anxious.

{"original_text": "There are two types of light sensitive cells, one that react to intensity of light in whole visible spectrum, but cannot recognise colour (animals that see in black and white). This one we call black and white eyes. The other type is sensitive to all colours (animals that see in colour). It has multiple light sensitive cells, each reacts to certain colour, from red to violet (and even other colours that are not in the visible spectrum). As I said, there are more than three types of cone cells. The distribution of them, as well as the distribution of rods, and the way their signals are processed in brain, gives some animals ability to see in colour, some - only in black and white, and some don't see in the same way as we do. As we can see, dog's colour vision is far from the one of human. Dogs can only see black and white and two tones of yellow, and we can guess that the world looks pretty dull to them. But dogs don't see in black and white as we see in black and white. Black and white vision is the vision where the light intensity is recognised, not the one with shades of grey. When you see in black and white, you can see shades of grey - the darker the colour, the darker shade of grey. But when you see in black and white, you can't see shades of grey. This is the reason why some scientists think that dogs can see in shades of grey, not in black and white. It's said that dogs see in the way similar to human with red-green colour blindness. So the world for them is filled with shades of grey and one other colour, probably green. The colours of their world are not the ones we see, but they see colours, or at least shades of grey. How to make a dog's life better? You can't change your dog's vision. But you can make the world more colourful to them. It's said that dogs like red colour. If you want to make a dog's toy, it's better to use red colour. You can also use green colour, which is the one they see the best. For me, it's a good reason to make a green dog collar.

{"original_text": "I don't think they quite fill the same role. The biggest appeal of zombies is that they are a faceless, humanoid foe that we can imagine performing all manner of horrible acts upon ourselves. They are an extension of our fear of death. Dinosaurs, on the other hand, are a menace in a different way. They are the big, scary, predators of childhood nightmares. There is a certain element of the unknowable in their looming presence, and they are not the spectre of our mortality. The combination of the two is a unique creature that has the potential to be a lot more terrifying than either of the two alone. Zombie dinosaurs do not necessarily have to be a bunch of T-Rexes shambling around. The first image that came to my mind was a velociraptor that has been recently reanimated and is as fast as ever, with a drive to survive. It would be an interesting mix of the two, and I think that is why I like the idea. It is a story waiting to be told. How to Write a Zombie Dinosaur The first thing to consider is whether you are going to write your story from the point of view of the zombies, the humans, or an unfortunate dinosaur. The zombie dinosaur's perspective would be the easiest to write, I think. As a zombie, you would not need to worry too much about backstory or development. Your zombie dinosaur can just wander around, munching on brains. You could also add a wrinkle by giving the dinosaur a goal, or a sense of purpose. Maybe he wants to hunt down his mate, or his children. Maybe he is just hungry, and wants to eat the tastiest brains he can find. The point of view of the humans would also be fairly straightforward, because you could essentially just write a regular zombie story. The dinosaur element would provide a twist that would make it a bit more interesting. It would be a good idea to think about where you put the dinosaur element, whether it should be just one creature, or an entire herd. The third option would be the most difficult, but also the most interesting. This is the perspective of another dinosaur that has to deal with the fact that zombies are shambling around the land. In this case, you would have to do a lot more work to create a believable and sympathetic dinosaur, but I think the payoff would be worth it. You would also have to create a zombie story from scratch. I think the best way to do that would be to make your zombie dinosaurs be infected by a disease. That way you can get away with writing a more traditional zombie story, but with a unique twist. You could go further and have the zombie dinosaurs be a threat to the uninfected dinosaurs, and that would be a lot more interesting. In any case, there is a lot of potential for a zombie dinosaur story. It could be anything from a tongue-in-cheek comedy to an epic tale of survival. It would be interesting to see how it could be done. Like I said, I'm not exactly the first to come up with this idea. There is a zombie dinosaur movie in the works, but I think that's kind of a shame. I think it would work much better as a book, or a series of books. The zombie dinosaur movie could be a decent zombie movie, but it would never live up to the promise of the concept. In any case, that's it for now.

{"original_text": "You mean like [hydroelectric power plants] (URL1)? Such as the [Hoover Dam] (URL0)?', \"The problem with river turbines is that you need a strong consistent flow of water which is not very common in rivers, and the process of diverting water into the turbines and back into the river can affect the ecosystems. But there is definitely a lot of power in the ocean. The waves are very powerful and predictable and we could harness that power.\" A lot of people live near the coast and, as Dodd puts it, \"you don't need to build a big tower to get to the ocean.\" His paper in the journal Science outlines his plans for this new power source. He has been testing his system in a tank in the lab and found it to be 50 per cent efficient. The next step is to put it into the ocean. A wave power system works by capturing the upward and downward motion of the waves and converting that into energy. This can be done in a number of ways. The first is to use floating buoys. The buoys rise and fall with the waves and when attached to a pump that is anchored to the sea floor, they move the pump up and down. The pump is attached to a turbine that generates energy. The pump can also be used to pump water out of the system to further increase the efficiency. Another way is to attach a turbine directly to the seabed. The wave motion drives the turbine to generate electricity. Both methods have been tested before but they are limited in efficiency and size. Dodd's design uses a different approach that uses a seabed turbine that is not anchored to the sea floor. \"It basically floats in a vertical plane and it moves back and forth with the waves. The motion of the sea then drives the turbine,\" says Dodd. \"The key here is that the seabed turbine is not anchored so it moves with the waves. \"If you anchor it to the sea floor, that's fine but the problem is that you can only make the turbine so big because the anchor system can't handle the stress. \"By not anchoring the turbine to the sea floor, you can make the turbine bigger because there is no limit to the size of the turbine.\" The size of the turbine affects the efficiency of the system. The bigger the turbine, the more energy that is generated. Dodd says that this system has the potential to be more efficient than wind turbines and tidal power systems. \"The reason we are so confident that this will be more efficient is because we are actually able to make the turbines bigger. \"The technology of tidal power has been around for a long time but the problem is that the turbines have to be small.

{"original_text": "Yes, exactly like that. A bit longer answer: ohm's law is more intuitive, V IR. In a batteryoutlet, you have a voltage differential that will push electrons through the wire in a circuit. You know that the electrons are pushed in one direction due to the voltage. So it is better to measure the voltage drop across the wire than current. The current is just the number of electrons per unit time passing through the wire. In the battery-outlet, the current is the same as the voltage times the resistance of the wire. Answer: They are actually the same thing. Current is measured by the rate of flow. The voltage drop across the wire is proportional to the amount of current. In Ohm's law it is written as VIR. Answer: Because current is flow of electrons.Voltage drop means potential difference.

Get behind your boys in blue. It's an outrageous suggestion but the time has come for a switch to 40 over cricket. It's easier to follow, the crowds are bigger and it's more exciting for the players. The problem with 50 over cricket is that it drags on far too long. Yes, the crowd needs to be there early and the day is long. However, it is still cricket and as such will always be a day out. But we have to realise that the crowd is the biggest attraction, not the sport. When I was a boy, as they say, the crowd used to go to cricket matches to see a cricket match. The players were secondary. Now the crowd goes to see the players. It's the only way to attract the casual spectator. The players love the 40 over game because they can hit the ball out of the ground, and they're not stuck there for 5 or 6 hours. And the fielding side also gets more action. The standard of play is just as high and the games can still be played over two days. It's still a test of endurance and skill. It's time to bite the bullet.

{"original_text": "Not sure how to ELI5 it because no one can understand electricity, but old toasters used bimetallic strips, whereas a lot of new toasters use capacitors. Basically when you turn a toaster on, current flows through a metal plate that is linked to the thermostat. If you're having trouble understanding anything there, it's ok, I have no idea how that works either. Older toasters work on the bimetallic strip, which has 2 pieces of metal that expand at different rates when heated. The strip bends when it expands, and it is attached to the toaster lever. When it bends, the lever moves and opens the toaster door, which lets the toast out. The new toasters use capacitors, which essentially work like batteries, but store their charge instead of giving it off. When they're charged up, they can release their charge quickly. When the toaster is turned on, a capacitor is charged up and then discharged very quickly. This current goes through a metal plate that is linked to the toaster lever, which pulls the lever and opens the toaster door. Wow, that's pretty cool. I can imagine capacitors being used to get rid of static electricity, but I can't imagine how they would be used for this. There's a full explanation on how capacitors work at HowStuffWorks, but the general concept is that capacitors can store an electrical charge. When it's charged up, the charge on it is basically like having a whole bunch of batteries hooked up together. Then when you discharge it, all that energy is released in a short burst. They can be used as a backup power source for computers or other electronics, and they're also used for things like the flash for cameras. EDIT: I made a mistake, they actually use a bimetallic strip to discharge the capacitor. I had read somewhere that the capacitor is discharged through the metal plate, but it actually uses the bimetallic strip. So it's pretty much the same thing as a capacitor? The bimetallic strip and the capacitor work together, so they're basically the same thing.

It makes sure that the capacitor doesn't discharge through the metal plate. The strip allows the capacitor to discharge through it, but if the capacitor discharges too quickly, it overheats the strip and causes it to bend and open the toaster door.

{"original_text": "Breast tissue remains immature in women until lactation. There's a reason your breasts feel swollen when you first become pregnant: immature lobule glands are changing. The longer you breastfeed, the more mature they become. This is one of the reasons why breast cancer risk is so low during pregnancy and lactation, and the longer you breastfeed the greater the risk reduction. So it's no surprise that the biggest risk factor for breast cancer is not breastfeeding. Some studies have found that breastfeeding for a year or more significantly reduces a woman's risk of breast cancer throughout her life, compared to women who have not breastfed at all. A recent study found that breastfeeding reduced the risk of the more aggressive HER2-positive breast cancers.

Incredibly vivid but with a kind of peacefulness and non-chaotic feeling. My dreams have been pretty interesting ever since I started doing lucid dreaming and astral projection. It's hard to explain but it's very different. I usually feel more exhausted after a night of not dreaming than one where I dream a lot. Your dreams could have been brought on by a change in your diet. For me, they usually have to do with a change in sleep schedule or an increase in work related stress. You're just trying to fit in the \"Kill me\" request in every possible sentence. I mean, \"Have you ever dreamed a really long dream?\" would also be a possibility, right? I know exactly what you mean, I can't even tell you how many times I have woken up because of dreaming. I just can't fall back asleep. I have that every time I take a nap.

Not everyone has the same tolerance for alcohol, and when people do overindulge, the results are never pretty. Sneezing, a runny nose, and watery eyes are the most common symptoms of an allergic reaction. Most people will only experience these reactions during allergy season.

Chronic sinusitis is when your sinuses are inflamed for longer than eight weeks. If you've tried allergy medications with no results, your allergies could be to blame. A variety of allergens can trigger an overreaction, including food, mold, pet dander, or dust mites. The most common allergens, though, are pollens, insects, and animal dander. Pollens can come from trees, grasses, and weeds. Insects, of course, are stinging insects, like bees or wasps. Animal dander includes hair or skin from common pets, such as cats, dogs, and birds. Allergies are diagnosed by an allergist. After discussing your symptoms, he or she will ask you to undergo skin or blood tests. These tests will reveal the specific allergens that are causing your reactions. Once your allergens have been identified, the allergist will recommend a treatment plan. The goal is to keep your immune system from overreacting to allergens. While allergies can't be cured, they can be controlled. Allergy treatments include avoiding allergens, allergy shots, or medications. If you have severe allergies that are affecting your quality of life, your allergist may recommend allergy shots. Allergy shots are typically given once a week for three to five years. Allergy shots are a good alternative for patients who can't avoid their allergens.

{"original_text": "Unfortunately this question cannot be explained like you are five because five year olds are not usually heartbroken. Denial plays a huge factor, and also memories with the person if any. If you have memories with the person or someone who was very close to you, then denial will play a much bigger role. Memories are very important because they are what you are able to hold on to when someone is gone. They are also important because it is the only thing you have left from that person. If it is someone you were very close with and you didn't have a lot of time with them, then it will be very hard to let go. It is also extremely hard to let go when you are a kid and didn't have time to cope with the person's death. Children grieve differently than adults because they don't understand that the person is gone forever, and that they are not coming back. They will think that one day they will come back. If you have a close friend who has passed and they were very young, then it is hard for the other friends to cope with it because they didn't have time to process it. It is also hard for them because they think of the person every day and think about what they would be doing. If it is someone very close to you, then it is hard for you to cope with it because they have a large impact on your life. You are also trying to cope with it while trying to live life without them. If someone you are very close to has passed, then your life will be completely different without them. You will have to cope with the grief of that person while trying to live your life. People have a hard time coping with someone passing because they are forced to live life without them and do the things that they used to do. It is also hard to cope with someone dying when they are very young because you are forced to accept the fact that they are not going to grow old with you. You are forced to accept that they will never get to do the things they wanted to do in life, and you are also forced to accept that you are not going to be able to do things with them.

This was a well-intentioned but misguided policy. In order to meet its CRA targets, a bank would have to lend money to people who could not afford to pay it back. But because most of the people in poor neighborhoods were unable to obtain a mortgage, the banks started to lend to people who would never have qualified in the past.

{"original_text": "Madeira is a \"fortified wine,\" meaning that its alcohol content is made much higher than traditional wine. This was to prevent spoilage on long sea journeys. Since alcohol is a natural preservative, it would help keep the wine from going bad. Today, the fortification process is simply done to increase the alcohol content. Although Madeira has a higher alcohol content than most wine, it has an overall drier taste, because of the way it's produced. The grapes are first harvested and crushed. Then the grapes go through a process called \"estufagem\" or heating. The grapes are heated and dried (usually in the sun), and then pressed and placed into barrels. Madeira is a fortified wine. This means that a small amount of brandy is added to the wine after fermentation. The wine is then aged in casks, which are moved around to different levels of temperature to even out the taste and quality. The grapes used to make Madeira are very delicate, and can't be subjected to extreme weather conditions. That's why the island of Madeira is the perfect place for growing grapes. Madeira is not a very large island, and is located far out in the Atlantic. Its climate is very temperate. Madeira's latitude is the same as Morocco's, which is a very warm and dry climate. Madeira, on the other hand, has a humid and mild climate.

{"original_text": "If you're talking about video editing, it started with cutting and splicing the tape. The splice points had to be identified by using a magnetic developing fluid. It had fine iron particles which would stick to the tape's magnetic surface wherever there was a change in polarity. When the particles were black, it meant that the tape was not magnetized. Wherever the particles were red, it indicated a magnetized spot on the tape, which was the splice point. This was laborious, and it is not surprising that the first video editing systems were based on cutting and splicing. In the late 1950s, the first professional video editing systems used a process called pulse editing, which also involved a form of splicing. The video editing machine used pulse signals from the video tape to determine splice points, and it would cut and splice the tape at these points. Some of the better pulse editing systems used a synchronizing head to provide the pulse, which made them more accurate. The synchronizing head had a coil wrapped around it that generated a signal as it rotated past the magnetic tape. The video tape recorder's rotary head was positioned just behind the synchronizing head. The video tape's pulse signal was delayed by a fixed amount (in the form of a delay line or a short section of tape) to match the timing of the synchronizing head. This synchronized signal was then used to accurately splice the video tape at that point. In 1967, the BBC developed the first successful system for editing magnetic tape electronically. The machines used a system called cut and paste editing, which used an electron beam to cut the tape and a separate system to \"paste\" the tape back together. In 1968, a group of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a computer system called EditDroid. This system used computers and video discs to edit film. It was never commercially available. The first practical system for digital editing of video was called the Editec. It was developed by CBS in 1971, and used a minicomputer to switch video signals. In 1974, CBS developed a system called the EditDroid, which was the first computer-based digital non-linear editing system to be used in a broadcast environment. It recorded digital video onto two-inch quadruplex videotape. The first commercially available non-linear editing system was called the EDL and it was available in 1974. It recorded video onto two-inch quadruplex videotape. The first digital non-linear editing system was the CMX 600, which was introduced in 1977. It recorded digital video onto laserdiscs. The first digital video effects were also introduced in 1977. These were the DVE and FLI systems from CMX, and the DVE and Harmon systems from Ampex. In 1979, the EEC proposed the development of a computerized system for editing television programs. This was developed by Bosch in Germany and Thomson-CSF in France. In 1982, a consortium of European companies (including Bosch, Philips and Thomson) formed the European Broadcasting Union, and this organization took over the project. The first system developed by the EBU was called CMX 6000. It recorded video onto laserdiscs. The first public demonstration of a digital non-linear editing system was a system called the EditDroid, which was demonstrated at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in 1979. In 1984, Sony and Matsushita Electric (which later became Panasonic) introduced digital recording systems for videotape. These systems recorded digital video onto helical-scan videotape. The first system was the Sony EVP, which recorded one video channel. This was followed by the Sony BVH, which recorded two digital video channels, and the BVW, which recorded four digital video channels.

{"original_text": "To understand how an OS is built you first need to understand what an OS is and what composes it. An OS is simply an environment that allows one or more applications to run. In order to understand what an OS does, we need to know what an application is. An application is a program, like Microsoft Word, that uses the OS to communicate with the hardware. Applications are created to do specific tasks. The OS is built to provide a standard way for applications to communicate with the hardware. There are four main pieces that make up an OS: Kernel - The kernel is the core of the OS and provides the most basic functions. The kernel is what allows an application to communicate with the hardware. In OS X, the kernel is called XNU. Drivers - Drivers are built to communicate with the hardware. Drivers are built for each different piece of hardware. OS X includes thousands of drivers for different hardware. User space - This is the space where applications run. User space is isolated from the kernel and from each other. This allows multiple applications to run at the same time. Firmware - Firmware is built into the hardware. Firmware runs before the OS is booted and is responsible for initializing the hardware. This is an overly simple explanation of what an OS is and what makes it up.

{"original_text": "The word \"frictionless\" is a bit awkward here, because if the question is after what I think it's after then friction is important. If you roll something down a ramp and the ramp is vertical then of course the velocity will be 0 at the bottom, and the acceleration is of course g. If you let it roll down a slope then it'll have some velocity at the bottom, and the acceleration is of course still g. So the question is probably about a curve, but then it's not really frictionless because if you are allowed to use friction then you can actually make it roll on a straight line (with a bit of creativity). To solve this with no friction you'll need to set the centripetal force equal to gravity (because the ball has to move in a circle). Answer: There is no friction at the surface and you are not able to apply any other forces so you have no way of altering the direction of the ball, so it moves in a straight line. Answer: If you apply a force to the ball in a direction perpendicular to the ground, the ball will roll to the side. The sideways force cancels out the centripetal force, and the ball has a tangential speed at the bottom of the incline. Answer: \"With no friction\" I would assume this to mean no friction at all, and in this case the ball would simply roll straight down the ramp. With friction, the ball would slow down as it slid down the ramp, and come to a stop at the bottom.

Comment: JMac, I understand that it has no reason to slow down, but I think the question is referring to some sort of curved incline. Comment: NickR Then, the centripetal force will cause the ball to move in a circular path. If there is no friction, then the ball will travel at a constant speed. Comment: I think you may be right. I'm just trying to imagine how you could make a ball travel in a circle, but not slow down. Comment: NickR You would need to apply a force at a 90 degree angle to the direction of travel.

I had to take it back to the computer shop, and they said that the hard drive had burned out. I'm not sure how it could have happened, since i wasn't using the computer when it happened. It's strange that the computer would burn out from getting too hot, because i've used it on my lap before without it burning out. I was thinking about buying a new hard drive and installing it myself, but then I thought that maybe there is some problem with the motherboard that is making the hard drive burn out.

{"original_text": "There was a scientific trend in the past called Material Determinism that attempted to explain that the tropical regions were not as developed for reasons such as being warmer and having different kinds of diseases that affected the development. While the theory has not been totally abandoned, it is no longer the prevailing one. Some contemporary scholars, like Jared Diamond, have written books about the history of the world. They have theorized that the reason why the world is the way it is today, in terms of the quality of life in different regions, is the geographical location of different cultures in the world. However, more recent scholars have tried to explain that the culture and the values of the people are the most important factors that determine a country's development and not geography. There are some important factors that need to be discussed in this debate. The first issue to discuss is the idea that the culture and the values of a people are the most important determinants of the quality of life of the population. This idea is based on the argument that culture is an important aspect of any population. There are two major kinds of culture that need to be discussed here. These are the material culture and the non-material culture. The material culture involves the way that the people of a country live and their way of life. The non-material culture of a country involves the way the people of the country think and the values that they hold. The second issue that needs to be discussed is the idea that geography plays an important role in the development of a country. There are many important factors that need to be considered here. Some of these factors include the climate of the region, the natural resources that are available, and the social and political structures of the people. Finally, it is important to note that both culture and geography play an important role in the development of a country. For example, the climate and the natural resources of a country are important factors in the development of the country. However, the culture of the people will determine how the people will use the resources that are available. In conclusion, both the geographical location and the culture and values of a people play an important role in the development of a country.

{"original_text": "Both ferns and ice crystals grow as [fractals] (URL0). The idea is that if you're scaling something (adding a leaf to a fern, expanding an ice crystal), you're always following the same rule. I was thinking of that because I have just finished writing a book, which is a fractal. The ideas are the same at different scales. The book is divided into three sections, each of which is divided into three. The sections are called \"What's the problem?\" \"What's the solution?\" and \"How are we going to get there?\" Each of those sections is divided into three sections. The first part of each of those sections is what the problem is, the second part is what the solution is, and the third part is how we're going to get there. A fractal is a series of self-similar patterns. When you're looking at ferns, ice crystals, coastlines, and so on, they look the same at different scales. I think the same thing is true of the book. That's the point of the book. The book is about the interconnectedness of all things. We're talking about the idea that we're all in this together. It's a book about how we are part of the same thing. It's a book about how we are part of the same earth, the same waters, the same food chains, the same ecosystems, the same society, the same economy, the same political system. The book is about how we are in this together, and it's a fractal in that sense. Each of the three sections of the book is about the interconnectedness of all things, the interconnectedness of all life, of all matter, of all energy, of all information. The first section, \"What's the problem?\" is about the interconnectedness of all the things that are going wrong, of all the things that are leading us to the brink of disaster. The second section is about the interconnectedness of all the solutions to those problems. The third section is about the interconnectedness of all the actions that we can take to create those solutions. Those are the three sections of the book. Each of those sections is divided into three sections. \"What's the problem?\" looks at the problems that we have with the economy, with our democracy, with the ecosystems. \"What's the solution?\" looks at the solutions that we need to have with the economy, with our democracy, with the ecosystems. \"How are we going to get there?\" looks at what we need to do to make those solutions happen. Now, there's a different way of looking at the book. There's another way of looking at the book that is not fractal. The other way of looking at the book is that it's not about the interconnectedness of all things. It's not about the interconnectedness of all problems, all solutions, all actions. It's about the interconnectedness of all life, of all matter, of all energy, of all information. When you look at it that way, it's not a fractal. It's not a series of patterns that are repeated at different scales. It's just one pattern, the same pattern, repeated at different scales. In other words, it's a fractal in the sense that it's the same pattern, but it's not a fractal in the sense that it's a series of patterns that are the same. So, which way is it?

The idea is that if you're scaling something (adding a leaf to a fern, expanding an ice crystal), you're always following the same rule. I was thinking of that because I have just finished writing a book, which is a fractal. The ideas are the same at different scales. The book is divided into three sections, each of which is divided into three. The sections are called \"What's the problem?\" \"What's the solution?\" and \"How are we going to get there?\" Each of those sections is divided into three sections. The first part of each of those sections is what the problem is, the second part is what the solution is, and the third part is how we're going to get there. A fractal is a series of self-similar patterns. When you're looking at ferns, ice crystals, coastlines, and so on, they look the same at different scales. I think the same thing is true of the book. That's the point of the book. The book is about the interconnectedness of all things. We're talking about the idea that we're all in this together. It's a book about how we are part of the same thing. It's a book about how we are part of the same earth, the same waters, the same food chains, the same ecosystems, the same society, the same economy, the same political system. The book is about how we are in this together, and it's a fractal in that sense. Each of the three sections of the book is about the interconnectedness of all things, the interconnectedness of all life, of all matter, of all energy, of all information. The first section, \"What's the problem?\" is about the interconnectedness of all the things that are going wrong, of all the things that are leading us to the brink of disaster. The second section is about the interconnectedness of all the solutions to those problems. The third section is about the interconnectedness of all the actions that we can take to create those solutions. Those are the three sections of the book. Each of those sections is divided into three sections. \"What's the problem?\" looks at the problems that we have with the economy, with our democracy, with the ecosystems. \"What's the solution?\" looks at the solutions that we need to have with the economy, with our democracy, with the ecosystems. \"How are we going to get there?\" looks at what we need to do to make those solutions happen.

{"original_text": "During cardio the heart increases its workload and all the body's other systems adjust to help support that endeavor. The blood vessels dilate, the muscles do their best to help the heart, and the lungs increase their oxygen intake to help fuel the muscles. In a nutshell, the heart is the engine of the body. It pumps blood through the circulatory system and transports oxygen and nutrients to the muscles. But there's another way of thinking about the cardio system: as an information highway. In a 24-hour day, the heart generates more than 24 million pulses of information, and the circulatory system is the physical mechanism that carries that information from the heart to the rest of the body. \"One of the more important functions of the heart is to communicate with the rest of the body,\" says Dr. Stephen Sinatra, a cardiologist who writes extensively about the relationship between the heart and the brain. Without good communication between the heart and the rest of the body, the immune system can't do its job, and the body can't maintain its healthy equilibrium. \"When the heart is unhealthy, the rest of the body's systems are unhealthy,\" says Dr. Sinatra. \"But when the heart is healthy, it can be a powerful messenger.\" When the heart communicates effectively with the rest of the body, the result is a boost in energy, improved sleep, stronger immune system, and better ability to handle stress. And there's another benefit: the heart plays a key role in the heart-brain connection that's becoming an increasingly important field of scientific study. \"The heart may actually be the seat of consciousness and human emotion,\" says Dr. Sinatra. The following story is adapted from the book, A Simple Guide to a Healthy Heart. How to Train Your Heart It's one thing to say you want to improve your heart health, but quite another to know how to go about it. \"To have a strong heart, you need to exercise it,\" says Dr. Stephen Sinatra. \"It's like training a muscle.\" The difference between a strong heart and a weak one is that a strong heart can handle a higher workload. For instance, if your heart pumps 3 liters of blood per minute, and you have a high-performance heart, you can pump 4 liters of blood per minute without any strain on your heart. But if your heart is weak, you can't. \"You can't train your heart by running out and doing a marathon, or even a half marathon,\" says Dr. Sinatra. \"You need to work up to it. You can train your heart by doing simple exercises, like walking and bicycling.\" To get your heart in shape, Dr. Sinatra recommends starting with 10 minutes of exercise. \"You should be able to complete 10 minutes of exercise without being winded,\" says Dr. Sinatra. \"Once you can do that, add another 5 minutes to your routine.\" It's important to start at a low level and build up your strength, says Dr. Sinatra. \"There are a lot of people who start off with a regimen that is too hard for them. They hurt themselves.\" How to Measure Your Heart's Performance Besides feeling winded, it's a good idea to know how to measure your heart's performance so you know when you can move up to the next level. You can do this by taking your pulse, and then performing some simple arithmetic. Take your pulse by placing two fingers on your wrist, near your thumb. (Or if you're not sure how to do this, you can take it by placing two fingers on the inside of your elbow and pressing gently.) Count the number of beats in 10 seconds, then multiply that by 6. The resulting number is how many times your heart beats per minute. Here's an example: If you take your pulse and find that your heart beats 100 times in 10 seconds, then 6 times 100 is 600 beats per minute. If you want to train your heart to be stronger, you need to know if it's working at a higher level. A good goal for most people is to get their heart rate down to 60 beats per minute. In this case, your target heart rate is 60 beats per minute, and you'll know you've reached it if you can exercise for 10 minutes without getting winded.

Demanding a briefcase full of Yuan together with a chinese banker riding a panda who can exchange those yuan for dollars, is still demanding legal tender and thus not a failure to accept legal tender to settle all debts.',Tender\" is a latin-based legal term for \"offering.\" It means that if you owe someone money they're not allowed to make up rules after the fact like \"banknotes may only have serial numbers ending in 3.\" If a creditor refuses a legal offering - legal tender - to pay a debt they can't complain to courts that they need to be paid in a specific way. Put simply: US dollars are US dollars. If both parties agree to different rules before a sale is made, those are enforceable. Same if payment is made before the buyer obtains a good or service. It's only when payment is made afterwards and there is no specific agreement about how to pay that a seller is forced to accept cash. All of this is open to interpretation by courts. For example, if you eat at a restaurant and try to pay with a 100 bill, the manager refuses it on a reasonable suspicion that the bill is counterfeit, you are still legally required to pay even if further investigation shows that that the bill is legit. Only when a creditor is unreasonable will a judge invalidate the debt."}

{"original_text": "Psychology student here to disappoint you! Because we're all unique. Simple as that. Some need more sleep, some need less. The human brain (hell, any brain) is a very complex thing and there are way too many variables to make a blanket statement that all humans need this amount of sleep or that amount of sleep. Anyway, to answer your question: as long as you're well rested, a few missed hours of sleep shouldn't harm you. Of course if you're chronically sleep deprived, it'll have an impact on your health, but that's a different story. I've worked night shifts before, and when I've got a day off, I'll sometimes go to bed in the afternoon and then wake up in the evening. I find that I'm perfectly well rested. You know your body better than anyone. Listen to it and don't listen to some random person on the internet. So I took a week off work to give me some time to catch up on some sleep and other things and it has done me wonders. Bah, I've been running on 4-6 hours of sleep every day for years now. 6 hours is a lot to me, I barely can do 5. I usually can fall asleep for 5 to 6 hours, and I feel fully rested and awake, and I've been doing that for as long as I can remember. My mom does the same thing, she wakes up at 5 am to go to work, and when she gets home, she's still not tired, she can just go to sleep at 10 pm and get 6 hours of sleep, but she's not tired the next day. I've never been able to do that. I think I might be an insomniac, and I've never felt tired from lack of sleep. If I don't sleep for 30 hours I'll still feel fine, but if I sleep for 20 hours I'll still be tired. There was a time when I was in college and I used to drink a lot of coffee and energy drinks and such to stay up late to study or work on projects, and I would stay up all night and drink a lot of coffee and not sleep for 3 days, but I still felt great, I never felt like I was going to die or anything. I've also been on a couple of really long car trips (14 hour drives) and I've been able to drive for 12 hours straight and feel great. So yeah, I think I'm an insomniac, and I think it's a pretty cool thing, because I don't know what it's like to be tired from lack of sleep, and I love to sleep, I love dreaming. I do, however, get sleep paralysis sometimes, so I can't move when I wake up, and that can be pretty terrifying, so I don't know if it's worth it or not. I do feel tired when I get it though, so I don't know. Also, sleeping more than 8 hours always makes me feel sick, I've never been able to sleep for more than 8 hours without waking up sick. It's kind of weird. This guy knows what's up. I'm a night person and I don't function as well during the day, but I can and have worked a normal work schedule before. I agree with this, I'm the same way. I need 8-9 hours a night, and when I don't get it I'm a total zombie the next day. The one time I did manage to stay up for 36 hours straight I felt great, but that was a pretty rare occurrence. I do wonder if I'm an insomniac sometimes though, but it's not really a concern to me. Also, I've been curious, how do you stay up all night, is there something you do or take? I'm a night owl and I can stay up for days at a time without feeling any more tired than I do when I'm only getting 4 hours of sleep a night. I don't think I'm an insomniac though, I think I'm just a night person. I can't really stay up for days on end anymore though, my body just shuts down at some point, even if I'm not tired. I think it's my metabolism. I usually wake up at 8 AM but I usually can't fall asleep until 2 AM", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "How much sleep do you get every day and do you think it's good or bad for you?

On the other hand, we have learned to ignore constant, low-volume sounds like a refrigerator or a fan. All of us have had the experience of being in a quiet room and then having a jet plane fly overhead. It's so deafening that we can't hear anything else. The quick adjustment we make in our brains is to understand that the jet is a far off sound, and the fact that we can hear it at all is astonishing. Imagine you were sitting in a quiet room, and someone walks in with a small magnet and places it on top of your head. What would happen? Not much. But what if that magnet was so strong that it attracted all of the metallic elements in your body? Your bones, your blood, your fillings, anything that is metal would suddenly become magnetized and attracted to the magnet. Your head would be ripped clean off of your neck. This is how we perceive sound. High-volume sounds, because of their intensity, seem to be much closer to us than they really are. Low-volume sounds, because of their quietness, seem to be a long way away. The distance of sound is called \"interaural time difference.\" Simply put, this is a fancy term that means \"the difference in time it takes the sound to reach each of our ears.\" An easy way to test this is to cup your hands behind your ears and make some noise with your mouth. Move your hands around behind your ears while making the noise. What you will hear is the sound changing pitch and becoming quieter or louder. The reason for this is because high-pitched sounds tend to bounce off of hard objects like walls or the floor. Low-pitched sounds do not. Because different frequencies bounce differently, it will sound as though the source of the sound is moving around. If you don't want a low-pitched sound to bounce off of anything, there is a simple trick. All you need to do is to put something soft and absorbent in front of the speaker.

It's best to write down the dream as soon as you wake up, before you forget it. It doesn't really matter what you dream about, just try to remember some of the details. Eventually, you'll start noticing that you're having dreams about the same things over and over again. For example, I always seem to have dreams where I'm on a bus, and I have to go to a certain stop but I can't find the stop. Its always the same dream, but it always takes place somewhere different, and I never find the stop. Its like a really frustrating, surreal version of Groundhog Day. But you can use these recurring themes to your advantage. Once you realize what the dream is about, you can try to wake up. Just keep repeating \"I'm dreaming\" to yourself until you wake up. Eventually, you'll get it. Lucid dreaming can be really fun. Its kind of an interesting experience. Anyway, I hope that helped.
