One night, she fell and broke her leg. She was out of work for months. But she didn't give up. She recovered from her injury and went right back to work. The first thing she did was put on her pink, frilly dress. We all have dreams and goals that we want to achieve. Sometimes those dreams and goals are too big to be achieved quickly. We must wait for them to come true. Others, we can achieve right now. The pink, frilly dress is a good illustration. A little girl may want to own a pink, frilly dress. She can work for months to save money to buy one. She may save enough to buy one, but she doesn't have enough to buy all of her other clothes at the same time. She will have to wear her old, worn out dresses until she can save enough to buy more. But that doesn't mean she can't wear a pink, frilly dress. She can make one from cloth and fabric. This illustration applies to us as adults. We can have a dream that seems like it is too big for us to accomplish now. But if we work toward it, we can reach that dream. We may not get there as fast as we want, but we will get there. We can't have everything we want at once, but we can have some of what we want now.

Suddenly Dan found a house for sale that was perfect. He had never heard of the area. The house was in an area called the \"Northwest Passage.\" It was just a small part of the town of Bellingham, Washington. But it was very secluded. It wasn't far from the city, but it was way out in the country. Dan got a map of the area. He found the Northwest Passage. It was a small area that included about 20 houses.

There were many stories about a dark spirit. Dan had never heard of a spirit like this. The spirit was called \"the dark passenger.\" The woman called it \"the passenger.\" Dan decided to take a walk around the house. He walked along the house. He found a path that led into the woods.

He didn't know they were there, but they were extremely aggressive. As soon as they saw him, they pounced. Sean fell on the ground, and was getting mauled by the coyotes. He began to cry for help, and kept screaming. A few seconds later, he had lost consciousness. A few minutes later, a man was walking down the road. He heard screaming and looked around. He walked into the field, and saw Sean being mauled by the coyotes. The man began to run into the field. He scared the coyotes away, and ran over to Sean. Sean was crying, and was covered in cuts and bruises. The man picked Sean up and ran home with him. He brought Sean into his home. He was a nurse, and knew what to do. He cleaned the cuts and bandaged them up. Sean's face was all messed up. He looked like he was beaten. The nurse put him into a coma. He was going to be in there for a few days. The next morning, Sean woke up. He was in a hospital room. He looked over at the nurse. \"What happened? Where am I?\" asked Sean. \"You were mauled by a pack of coyotes.\" said the nurse. \"How did I get here?\" asked Sean. \"A man brought you in.\" said the nurse. \"I want to thank him.\" said Sean. \"You should thank him in person.\" said the nurse. \"How do I do that?\" asked Sean. \"I'll take you there.\" said the nurse. The nurse brought Sean to the man's house. The nurse said the man's name was Ian. They walked up to the door, and rang the doorbell. The door opened, and Sean saw Ian. He was extremely handsome. Sean was completely star-struck. \"Hello there.\" said Ian. \"Hi.\" said Sean. \"This is Sean. He is the man you saved last night.\" said the nurse. \"It was no problem. I'm happy to have saved him.\" said Ian. Sean was completely speechless. He was having a difficult time looking at Ian. \"I'm just glad you're okay.\" said Ian. \"I am too. I'm really grateful.\" said Sean. \"I'm happy to hear that.\" said Ian. \"I'll see you later.\" said the nurse. \"See you.\" said Sean. The nurse left, and Sean and Ian were left alone. \"I'm Sean.\" said Sean. \"Nice to meet you.\" said Ian. Ian invited Sean inside. Sean followed him into the living room. Sean was excited to be inside Ian's house. He had a huge crush on Ian. \"I'm glad you're okay.\" said Ian. \"Thanks. I'm glad to be alive.\" said Sean. \"You shouldn't have been walking around the field like that.\" said Ian. \"I didn't know they were there.\" said Sean. \"You should've been more careful.\" said Ian. \"You're right. I feel bad about that now.\" said Sean. \"You shouldn't. It's not your fault.\" said Ian. \"Thank you.\" said Sean. Sean felt extremely bad. He was trying to avoid eye contact with Ian. Ian could tell Sean was having a difficult time. He walked over to Sean. Sean turned around. \"It's okay. You shouldn't feel bad.\" said Ian. Sean began to cry. He was completely humiliated. \"I'm sorry.\" said Sean. \"Don't be.\" said Ian. \"I just feel so terrible.\" said Sean. \"You're alive, aren't you? That's all that matters.\" said Ian.

{"original_text": "My grandparents bought me a kite one day. My grandpa showed me how to get it to fly. I went off on my own to fly it. A really big gust of wind took the kite and it flew away. I cried and ran after it, but it was so high that it was out of my reach. It was the first time I felt grief. I didn't understand what had happened to it. Many people do not know what to do when someone dies. In fact, when I meet with families to plan funerals, I find that most people are scared to talk about their own death. People often say that they don't want to upset the family or friends that are grieving, but I am the one that is upset. It is frustrating to me that the grief process is not understood. I understand that the grieving process is not easy and that grieving is a lifetime process, but most people are scared of the grief process. My grandpa taught me a lot about how to deal with the grief process and death. He taught me that it's okay to cry and that it's okay to be sad. I remember him saying that it is normal to want to cry and not to hold back your tears. He told me that it was okay to be sad, but to not be sad for too long. He said that life is worth living and that we should always look at the good things. He said that we should honor our loved ones that have passed away by living life to the fullest. He said that we should be thankful for the time that we had with our loved ones. I have learned that there is a difference between \"mourning\" and \"grieving.\" Mourning is the process of expressing sorrow, especially after the death of someone close. Grieving is the process of recovering from loss. Mourning is how we express our sorrow, while grieving is the way that we cope with loss. When we lose someone, we feel sad. We miss them. We wish they were still here with us. We want to be able to talk to them. We want to go back in time and do things differently. We wish we could change the past. We wish we could do it over. As I have gotten older, I have experienced many more losses. I have seen people in my life lose a spouse. I have seen friends lose a parent. I have seen parents lose a child. I have lost a best friend. Each time I have experienced the loss of someone close to me, I have learned more about the grieving process. I have learned that it is okay to be sad. It is okay to cry. We should not hide our emotions. We should embrace our emotions. We should not be afraid of our emotions. We should be honest with ourselves. I have learned that it is okay to talk about our loved ones. We should share stories about our loved ones. It is okay to celebrate our loved ones. We should reminisce. We should be happy about the memories that we have. I have learned that it is okay to feel alone. It is okay to be angry. It is okay to be sad. It is okay to have your \"off\" days. It is okay to feel lost. I have learned that there are many ways to grieve. We all grieve differently. We all feel differently. We all express our emotions differently. I have learned that everyone is different and that no one is the same. I have learned that I can make new friends and that I can still have fun. I have learned that it is okay to make new friends and that it is okay to be happy. I have learned that I am allowed to have a life and that I am allowed to move on. I have learned that I will never forget my loved ones. I have learned that the best way to celebrate the life of our loved ones is by living life to the fullest. I have learned that there are many ways to celebrate the life of our loved ones. We can celebrate their life by continuing to love what they loved, by doing what they loved, and by making new memories. I have learned that it is important to honor the life of our loved ones by being grateful for the time that we had with them. I have learned that we should celebrate the life of our loved ones by being grateful for all of the things that we have been given. I have learned that it is okay to be different.

{"original_text": "Victor started playing football when he was 8 years old. He practiced everyday hoping to become professional one day. Victor was a senior in High School being scouted by over 20 major universities around the world. He got into a car accident leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Victor's dreams of playing football were over. Victor was in the hospital for months. He was angry, sad and depressed. Victor's family and friends had a hard time seeing him depressed everyday. One day his mother told him that she was going to go to church with his father. Victor was puzzled, his parents had been divorced since he was a baby. Victor's mother had told him that she was Christian and his father was not. Victor was always curious about God and the Bible but never had the time to find out more. Victor's parents went to church together and then came home with good news. They told him that the pastor at their church, Pastor Brown, was going to come to the house the following week to talk to Victor. When Pastor Brown arrived, Victor immediately asked him the question that had been puzzling him for years, \"Pastor Brown, how can a God who is suppose to love everyone, allow bad things to happen to people?\" Pastor Brown smiled and replied, \"Victor, I'm glad you asked that question. But to answer that, I need to tell you a story from the Bible. The story is about a man named Job. Job was the greatest man in the East, and he was the greatest man in the West. He was the greatest man in the North, and he was the greatest man in the South. He was a great and mighty man among all the people of the East. He was perfect and upright, one who feared God and shunned evil. Job had seven sons and three daughters. He also had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East. And his sons would go and feast in their houses, each on his appointed day, and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, \"It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.\" Thus Job did regularly. Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them. And the Lord said to Satan, \"From where do you come?\" So Satan answered the Lord and said, \"From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.\" Then the Lord said to Satan, \"Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?\" So Satan answered the Lord and said, \"Does Job fear God for nothing? Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!\" And the Lord said to Satan, \"Behold, all that he has is in your power; only do not lay a hand on his person.\" So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord. Then Satan went from the presence of the Lord, and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes. Then his wife said to him, \"Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!\" But he said to her, \"You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?\" In all this Job did not sin with his lips. Now when Job's three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, each one came from his own place-Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite.

{"original_text": "Benny was always moving house. Because of this, he never made many friends in the neighbourhood. He knew that if he made new friends, it would hurt when he left. He thought it was better just to keep to himself. One day, Benny and his family moved again. This time they moved to a house next door to a boy called Andrew. Andrew was different to the other boys that Benny knew. Andrew didn't care much about running around or playing games. He was happier just sitting on his front porch, drawing pictures. One day, when Benny was walking past Andrew's house, Andrew called out to him. \"Benny,\" he said. \"Will you come and play?\" Benny was surprised, but he thought it would be nice to have someone to play with. \"OK,\" he said. He went to Andrew's house and they sat on the front porch together. They had fun for a while, but Andrew soon got bored of playing with Benny. He went back to his drawing. Benny got bored, too. \"I'm going home,\" he said. Benny was sad. He didn't want to play with Andrew any more. He didn't like the way Andrew had just stopped playing with him. The next day, Andrew was sitting outside again, drawing pictures. Benny didn't want to play with Andrew, but Andrew had said he would be his friend, and Benny wanted a friend. So he went outside and sat down beside Andrew. Andrew did the same thing as the day before. He drew his picture, then he got bored and stopped playing with Benny. Benny didn't like the way Andrew stopped playing with him. The next day, Andrew was sitting outside again, drawing pictures. Benny didn't want to play with Andrew, but Andrew had said he would be his friend. He wanted a friend, and so he went outside and sat down beside Andrew. \"Would you like to play?\" asked Benny. \"No,\" said Andrew. \"I'm drawing my picture.\" Benny didn't like the way Andrew stopped playing with him, but he wanted a friend. \"What are you drawing?\" he asked. \"A cat,\" said Andrew. \"Would you like to see it?\" Benny was surprised that Andrew wanted to show him his picture, but he thought he'd better say yes, if he wanted a friend. \"Yes,\" he said. Andrew held out his picture. It was a picture of a cat. It was a very good picture. It looked just like the cat. \"I'll show you how to draw it,\" said Andrew. He took another piece of paper and drew the same picture again. \"Here,\" he said. \"Take this piece of paper and draw it again.\" Benny was surprised that Andrew was being so kind. He was happy that he had a friend. Benny copied the picture. It wasn't as good as Andrew's, but it was good enough. \"Now we'll draw a different picture,\" said Andrew. He held out his paper to show Benny a picture of a dog. \"Draw this one,\" he said. Benny drew the dog picture. It was better than the cat picture. The next day, Andrew sat outside, drawing pictures. \"Would you like to play?\" asked Benny. \"No,\" said Andrew. \"I'm drawing a picture.\" Benny didn't like the way Andrew stopped playing with him, but he wanted a friend.

{"original_text": "Tom had never had a doctor check up. He hadn't been able to afford insurance. He was nervous about his first one. Luckily everything went smoothly. Tom was in surprisingly good health. His BP and heart were fine. Blood work showed that his cholesterol was a little high. The doctor prescribed a statin. Tom was put on statins for high cholesterol. The first weeks on statins were fine. Then Tom started to get nauseated and dizzy. He could not keep anything down. He was still able to go to work and drive himself. He was still able to function. He was not able to function to the best of his ability. He was unable to eat. He had no appetite. He was losing weight. He was becoming dehydrated. Tom went back to the doctor. He saw a different doctor. The doctor took him off of the statin. Tom felt better and was able to function better. Tom was fine. Tom was okay, but what if he wasn't? What if Tom had decided that he could not go to work? He had already told his boss that he was dizzy. He had already told his boss that he was not able to eat. What if Tom was fired? He had been a good employee. His boss was understanding, but Tom could not work anymore. He did not want to tell his boss about the dizziness and nausea. Tom could not afford health insurance. He did not have any sick days. He had no income. What would he do? How would he feed himself? This is why we must support health care reform. This is why we must support universal health care. Everyone deserves to have access to health care. Everyone deserves to be able to afford health care. Everyone deserves to be able to see a doctor and not worry about how they will pay for it. This is why we must support health care reform. Labels: health care, health care reform, statins You're right. Everyone should have the right to see a doctor, and not be afraid of losing a job or going bankrupt because they got sick. It's a basic human right, and it's disgusting that the richest country in the world denies it to so many of its citizens. This is the first I've heard about the dizziness and nausea that can occur with statins. As someone who has high cholesterol and has had two heart attacks, this is something I have to take seriously. Thanks for posting. Glad to hear your friend is okay now. I'm with you. I'm all for health care reform and believe it is a basic human right to have access to health care. I'm so sorry to hear your friend is having such a hard time. It's really sad that in this day and age, people are still suffering because of the lack of health care. It's so basic. Great post. So many people don't have access to health care. I live in Canada and have health care. I don't know what I would do without it. I'm glad your friend is fine now. What a scary experience for him. It's so important that we all take care of ourselves. Thanks for posting and bringing this to the attention of your readers. I've been on statins for a while. At first I thought it was the statins that made me tired. I'm also taking a BP med. Now I'm not sure if it's the meds or something else. I just have to be careful. I had a hard time with nausea from a statin. I had to stop taking it. I am glad your friend is feeling better. Thanks for posting and making people aware of this. I'm so glad your friend is okay. I can't imagine being so sick and not having the means to take care of myself. It's sad that anyone should have to suffer like that. I'm glad you friend is okay. It's sad that in this day and age, there are people still having to choose between food and health care. It's such a basic human right. Sorry I'm so late responding. I've been away. I'm glad to hear that Tom is okay now. I feel for him. It's so sad that people have to go through this. I wish everyone had access to health care. Thanks for bringing attention to this.

Lily stayed inside and just lay around most of the time. One day Kaylee was looking for Pikachu but couldn't find him. She asked Mommy and Daddy if they could go outside and look for him. Daddy looked in the yard and didn't find him so they went down the street looking for him. They looked and looked and Daddy was about to give up when Pikachu came running up to them!

{"original_text": "Heather had just made some dinner rolls. She left the tray on her counter to cool. When she returned minutes she saw bugs all over the rolls. She shooed them away, but they kept coming. She quickly realized it was a problem that would require more than just a few swats to get rid of. These bugs, called brown roll beetles, had been living in her home for quite a while. They were hiding in the walls and floor joists. They were feeding on the crumbs and spilled foods that Heather had been leaving behind. And now, they were looking for a new food source. Roll beetles are a small, brown beetle. They're about a quarter-inch in length. They have a round, hard shell. They're covered with tiny hairs. When they get really close to you, they might make you think of the scene from The Fly where Jeff Goldblum starts to break down and change into a fly. These beetles aren't known to bite or sting, though. They're not known to carry diseases, either. In fact, they really only cause damage when they chew through packaged foods. And they're a food source for other insects like ants, spiders, and carpet beetles. But if you're a homeowner, you don't want them living in your home, even if they don't bite or sting. You don't want them eating through the food in your kitchen. You don't want them bringing other insects into your home. And you certainly don't want them to just keep on multiplying until you have an infestation. Where Do Brown Roll Beetles Come From? You might wonder where these beetles come from. How did they get into your home? In most cases, they hitchhike their way into your home inside packages of food. For example, they can be found in boxes of cereal. They can get inside other types of foods, too, like flour, sugar, rice, pasta, and even oats. They can also get inside packages of dog food. These beetles are often found in older homes that have not been insulated. They can enter your home through cracks in your walls and windows. They can get inside through any opening you might have in your home. The best way to keep these beetles out of your home is to keep them from getting inside in the first place. You can do this by installing weather stripping around your windows and doors. You can also put it around the edges of your walls. You can also keep them from getting inside by storing foods in plastic containers. That way, they can't get inside the box, and they can't get inside the foods. You should also remove any old foods from your pantry. Roll beetles and other insects like to feed on old, spoiled foods. You should also vacuum often, especially in places where foods and crumbs tend to fall. Roll beetles can also get inside your home through your pets. If your dog is outside a lot, he might carry in some of these bugs. If you're not careful, they can get inside your home, too. A few roll beetles aren't a big problem. You can simply pick them up and throw them out. But if you notice a lot of beetles, it might be time to call in the professionals. A pest control professional can inspect your home for these beetles. He can determine where they're coming from and how they're getting inside. He can also make sure they're not bringing any other pests with them. He can make sure that the infestation doesn't continue to grow. If you're having a problem with roll beetles, we can help. Just give us a call today and we can set up an appointment for one of our professionals to come to your home.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "A woman in her 50s was having a bit of a problem with bugs in her home, so she called in the help of a professional pest controller."}

{"original_text": "Bob was poor. He never had a computer. One day, he decided to buy a computer. He found someone selling a used computer for a couple hundred dollars. Bob bought the computer. It was an old computer, but it worked well. Bob was happy. Several years later, Bob is much better off financially. He is in the market for a new computer. He looks at the latest and greatest offerings. He sees that the new computers are so much faster. He sees that the new computers are so much smaller. He sees that the new computers are so much easier to use. He sees that the new computers are so much more reliable. He sees that the new computers are so much more secure. He sees that the new computers are so much cheaper. Bob is very tempted. Bob wants a new computer. Bob has lots of money. Bob goes to the computer store and buys a new computer. Is Bob wrong to buy a new computer? If you think so, read on. In the last post, we talked about why Bob should buy a new computer. We said that this is a very important decision. And that it's a good decision to buy a new computer. But you may be thinking, \"But I don't have the money for a new computer. My old computer works fine. What should I do?\" I hear this a lot. Many people have a computer that works fine, but they don't have the money for a new one. First, if you don't have the money, don't buy a new computer. The last thing you need is more debt. You may think you can buy a new computer and pay it off in a year or two. But you know how that goes. You may end up with debt for many years. And the money that you have now is best used to pay off your old debt and get rid of that. So don't buy a new computer. But I have good news for you. This is where my story gets interesting. If you have a computer that works, you don't have to buy a new one. You can keep your computer and not buy a new one. If you do this, you can use the money that you saved and buy an iPod. If you don't have an iPod, you can buy an iPod. If you have an old iPod, you can buy a new iPod. If you have a 2GB iPod, you can buy a 4GB iPod. If you have a 16GB iPod, you can buy a 32GB iPod. If you have a 32GB iPod, you can buy a 64GB iPod. There are three reasons that I say this. First, you don't need a new computer. This is a common misconception. I want to emphasize this. You do not need a new computer. I don't want to be misunderstood here. I'm not saying that you can't have a new computer. What I'm saying is that you don't need a new computer. You don't need to buy a new computer. You don't need to spend your money on a new computer. You don't need to go into debt for a new computer. I've seen people with computers that work just fine. These computers do what they need them to do. These people are happy. But they think that they need a new computer. And they end up with a new computer that they don't need. You don't need a new computer. Second, you can buy an iPod instead of a new computer. This is an important principle in technology. I'll illustrate this with some examples. If you have a 4000 TV, you don't need a 2000 Blu-Ray player. You can buy a 200 Blu-Ray player. If you have a 1000 Blu-Ray player, you don't need a 500 Blu-Ray player. You can buy a 50 Blu-Ray player. If you have a 200 Blu-Ray player, you don't need a 100 Blu-Ray player. You can buy a 10 Blu-Ray player. If you have a 50 Blu-Ray player, you don't need a 25 Blu-Ray player. You can buy a 15 Blu-Ray player. If you have a 10 Blu-Ray player, you don't need a 5 Bl", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "In our series of letters from African-American journalists, we are going to look at a decision that one of our readers made a few years ago."}

That evening, Heather sits down at the piano and begins to play. She closes her eyes and imagines herself playing in a large concert hall. She plays the notes flawlessly. She imagines the people in the audience clapping. Heather opens her eyes. She is not in a concert hall. She is in her bedroom. There is no one clapping. She is sad. She made a mistake. She sold her most prized possession. She can't get it back. Lesson 13: Don't sell your soul. Life can be hard sometimes. Sometimes you may be tempted to do something you know is wrong in order to get what you want. Someone offers to buy your soul. They make you an offer that is hard to refuse. If you sell your soul, you will regret it. You may think that you can get away with it. God will not forget. A father and son are walking down the street. They hear a voice. They look around. They don't see anyone. The voice speaks again. The father and son look at each other. The voice speaks again. The father and son look at each other again. They decide to go home. The voice follows them. It is getting louder. It is getting closer. They are walking faster. They are getting scared. The father and son run into a building. They run into a room. They lock the door. They get on their knees. They pray. The father and son look at each other. They look at the door. The door shakes. The father and son kneel down. They pray again. The voice speaks again. It is so loud that they can't hear anything else. The father and son look at each other. They look at the door. They pray again. The door bursts open. The room is filled with light. The father and son look up. They see a man. He is wearing a white robe. He is carrying a big book. The man speaks to the father and son. The father and son are afraid. The father and son kneel down. The man looks at the father. The man looks at the son. The man puts his finger in the book. He closes the book. He puts the book under his arm. He walks out of the room. The door slams shut. The father and son open the door. They look around. They can't find the man. They look at each other. They leave the building. The father and son walk down the street. The father looks at his son. Lesson 14: Don't be afraid. Everyone will die. Everyone will stand before God. Some people will have fear in their heart. Some people will have faith. When you die, you will be judged. Your name will be written in the book. Your name will either be written in the book of life or the book of death. Those whose name is written in the book of life will go to heaven. Those whose name is written in the book of death will go to hell. If your name is not written in the book, you can still have it written in the book. You must have faith. You must believe in Jesus Christ. What happens when you die? You will be judged. Your name will be written in the book. Lesson 15: The book of life. There are two books. The first book is the book of life. The second book is the book of death. If your name is written in the book of life, you will go to heaven. If your name is written in the book of death, you will go to hell. God will judge you. God will look at your life. He will remember everything you have done. He will remember everything you have done. He will remember every sin you have committed. He will remember every good thing you have done. God will look at your heart.

As I was standing there with my hands in front of my face, the Frisbee hit me on the right side of my head. I fell down on the ground. I felt very dizzy, and I wanted to throw up. My friend ran over to me. \"Hey, are you all right?\" he asked. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"I'm just dizzy.\" \"Do you want to go home?\" he asked. \"No,\" I said. \"It'll be okay in a few minutes. I'll be all right.\" I got up and walked home. It took a while because my head hurt really bad, and I felt dizzy. My mom saw me when I got home. \"What happened to you?\" she asked. \"I hit my head with a Frisbee,\" I said. \"Oh, no,\" my mom said. \"Let's go to the emergency room.\" When we got to the emergency room, the nurse took me to a room. They took some X-rays of my head, and then they sent me to a doctor. \"How's your head?\" the doctor asked. \"It hurts,\" I said. The doctor put some ice on my head, and then I felt much better.

Dana told her that Al was supposed to bring the mower back that morning. Nudge said, \"Well, he went fishing. He didn't say where he was going. I thought he was going to mow your lawn.\" Dana was beside herself. She'd planned on mowing the lawn that morning. Now she couldn't because she had to go to work. She'd call Al when she got home. That evening, Dana's phone rang. It was Al. Al said, \"Did you get the mower back?\" Dana said, \"No, Al, I didn't. When I called your house earlier, I thought Nudge would have told you I needed the mower. You know that I have to leave for work early in the morning and I wanted to mow the lawn then. You said you'd bring the mower back to me this morning.\" Al said, \"I know I did. I just forgot. I'm sorry. I'll bring it right over.\" Dana said, \"No, you won't. I have to work tomorrow. Can you bring it over tomorrow morning?\" Al said, \"I can't do that. I'm going fishing.\" Al's exasperated wife, Nudge, shouted from the background, \"Don't you think you've had enough time for fishing?\" Al said, \"Nudge, can you bring the mower over to Dana's house?\" Nudge said, \"I don't know where Dana's house is. Do you?\" Al said, \"I guess I'll have to bring it over.\" Dana said, \"Al, can you bring it over at seven a.m. tomorrow?\" Al said, \"Sure, I can.

Dana asked her why Al hadn't brought the mower. Nudge said that Al had gone fishing again. Dana was furious. She couldn't get off work to mow the lawn that day. Dana called Al's house after she got home from work. Nudge said that Al had gone fishing again. Dana was really mad. She told Nudge that she'd better tell Al that if he didn't bring the mower over first thing in the morning that she'd take him to small claims court. The next morning, Al brought the mower. Al said, \"You're not going to take me to small claims court are you?\" Dana said, \"No, I'm not.

She thought, \"At least I have my cat.\" Dana looked down and saw her cat, Paulie, on the ground. He was staring at her. She was glad he was back. She was so glad that she picked him up and hugged him. Paulie said, \"Put me down! I don't like that!\" Dana put him down. She thought, \"Paulie is a great cat.

It made me so happy to see her happy. I spent all afternoon baking, and I made a mess that would have made Grandma proud. When the cookies were ready, I sat down with my wife and ate them together.

Mom: Eddie, that's the craziest thing I've ever heard. Eddie: Well, I'll find it later. I have to go now. Eddie left the store and walked home. He looked up. He saw the dollar on a tree branch. He got a stick and knocked it off. He picked up the dollar and put it in his pocket. Mom: I still can't believe that you found the dollar on a tree branch. Eddie: It's true. It was there. Mom: I think you made that story up. Eddie: No, it's true. I did find it. Mom: You know, I think I believe you. Eddie: Good. I have to go now. I need to give these flowers to my grandmother. Mom: Okay. Happy birthday, Grandma! Mom went home. Eddie went to his grandmother's house. He knocked on the door. Grandma: Eddie! I haven't seen you in a long time. Grandma: Come in. Come in. Eddie walked in. He took out the flowers. He gave them to his grandmother. Grandma: Oh, thank you, Eddie. They're beautiful. Eddie:"}

{"original_text": "Yesterday Kanye debuted his third fashion collection. He displayed it in Madison square garden. Unsurprisingly the clothes did not look appealing. Most of the clothes had a grunge look. I don't think that will be appealing to many people. It was also very basic and lacked that creative flair that Kanye is known for. Although the clothes did not look good, I think the show itself was entertaining. There was a play that was performed, some of the models were doing acrobatic moves on the runway. Taylor Swift vs Kanye West It's been a few years since Kanye West first interrupted Taylor Swift during the MTV VMA awards. When he interrupted her she was accepting the award for best female video. Ever since that day, it has been a feud between the two celebrities. After a few years of being silent, Kanye West has finally broken the silence. He released a song called \"famous\" which has a line that says \"I made that bitch famous.\" He claims that he had permission from Taylor Swift to say that line. However, Taylor Swift says that she never gave him permission to say that in the song. Taylor Swift's publicist claims that she heard the song for the first time when it came on the radio. This feud is continuing to heat up. The nominations for the 2016 Grammy awards are finally here. In my opinion, most of the nominations are not very surprising. The nominees for best album are Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift, and Alabama Shakes. Kendrick Lamar is probably going to win this award. He has been the most influential rapper in the last few years. I think the Grammys will reward him with this award. Best new artist is probably going to be awarded to Meghan Trainor. She has been one of the most popular artists over the last few months. Her music is upbeat and fun. Her music is probably going to appeal to the Grammy committee more than any other artists. The best song of the year is probably going to be awarded to Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars. Their song \"Uptown funk\" was a very big hit and was on the charts for a long time. I think the Grammy committee will reward it with this award. The best video of the year is going to be awarded to Taylor Swift. Her video for \"Bad blood\" was very unique and creative. It featured many different famous people. This is probably going to appeal to the Grammys committee. The album of the year will probably be awarded to Taylor Swift. Her album \"1989\" has sold more copies than any other album in 2015. This is also a big reason why she will most likely win this award. Recently Chris Brown was released from jail. He was released from jail after being incarcerated for violating his probation. He was sentenced to 131 days in jail. He was released early for good behavior. He recently released a song called \"what would you do.\" Diplo's Collaboration with Madonna Earlier this week, Madonna debuted a new song with Diplo. The song is called \"Bitch I'm Madonna.\" This is their first collaboration. The song features Nicki Minaj as a guest. Madonna has been nominated for her 15th Grammy award. She is nominated for best pop vocal album. She is nominated for her album \"Rebel Heart.\" The album has been popular among critics. Madonna is also nominated for best song written for visual media.

{"original_text": "Michelle always bought a breakfast burrito every morning. Yesterday she was late for work, but stopped for her burrito anyway. A man named Julio flirted with her inside the restaurant. When they left, they got into a car accident. Michelle was hurt badly and went to the hospital. The hospital said she had been hurt worse than they first thought. They decided they needed to take off her left foot. They put it in a jar and gave it to her. She was so happy to have her foot back! There is a lot of death in these stories. This is a funny example of that. The foot was a part of Michelle. It was part of her body and she liked having it there. Maybe Michelle was afraid she wouldn't be able to walk. She would be able to walk if she had the foot. She probably missed her foot. Maybe she was afraid to lose it. Why did Michelle like having the foot back? Can you think of a time when something that was a part of you was taken away? Maybe something like your toothbrush or your blanket. If you had to give a part of yourself away, what would you give? What do you think the foot would feel like? The foot was always with Michelle, but now it is not. Michelle must feel very different without her foot. What would it feel like for Michelle to have the foot back again? Would it feel good? What do you think Michelle would do with the foot now? What do you think the foot would do if it was alive? What would you do if you could have something like the foot back? What are some reasons to keep a part of yourself when you give it away? What are some reasons to give a part of yourself away? What are some ways to take care of a part of yourself when you give it away? What are some ways you can take care of yourself when you have a part of yourself? What would it feel like to lose a part of yourself? What would it feel like to get a part of yourself back? I need to take care of myself even when I have a part of myself. I have parts of myself that I can give away. I can take care of myself even when I have a part of myself. I can give parts of myself away. I have a part of myself I can give away. I can take care of myself when I have a part of myself. I can take care of myself when I give a part of myself away.

Sneezing is a reflex that helps your body remove germs, such as viruses and bacteria. A cold is a common illness caused by a virus. Most colds begin with a sore throat, a runny or stuffy nose, and a cough. It can take 2 or 3 days after being around someone who is sick for you to catch their cold. So, wash your hands often. If you have a cold, you may feel tired or weak. Drink plenty of liquids like water, juice, and soup. If you have a runny nose, use a tissue to catch the drainage. Most colds go away in a few days. Most colds are caused by viruses, not bacteria. Antibiotics are medicines used to kill bacteria. They do not help with colds caused by a virus. Call your doctor or nurse if your cold lasts more than 10 days. Call sooner if you have a fever, trouble breathing, or if you cannot sleep.

We have different rules and regulations that we follow. We have to wear pink on the outside but black on the inside. We have to stay in the house for the whole movie. We also have to say something about the movie every 5 minutes. So, my birthday is coming up next month and I have decided to have a mean girls themed birthday party. As you can imagine, the theme is all about pink, black and white and other fun colors. I have found that I can create a really cute birthday banner with some card stock and a banner maker. I have seen some really cute banners at Celebrate Express. They have a great selection of banners to choose from. I found a really fun one for me to use. I can't wait to get it in the mail and hang it up for my party. I have also decided to make some decorative cupcakes for the party. I found some cute cupcake liners at Celebrate Express. They are really fun and colorful. I think they will look really cute with the cupcakes. I can't wait to get them. Another fun thing that I ordered was the plates and napkins. I love the pink and black designs. I think they are really cute. I can't wait to set up my party. I am really excited about my upcoming birthday.

He walks over to the concession stand to get some nacho's and a drink. The lady at the stand told him that the nacho's were 2.50 and the drink was 1.50. Larry asked the lady if she accepted Visa. The lady replied \"Only if you dip it in chocolate.\" Larry was having trouble sleeping. He called his doctor to ask for some advice. The doctor told him to try counting sheep. Larry replied \"I can't, I'm allergic to wool.\" Larry is allergic to all animals, so his doctor recommended that he try using a service dog. Larry went to a pet store and asked about getting a service dog. The pet store owner told him that they only sell dogs that are already trained. Larry replied \"What if I train the dog myself?\" The pet store owner replied \"We have cats for that.\" Larry decided that he wanted to go hunting. He went out to the woods and took up a good position. He sat there for 6 hours and didn't see anything. He then decided to go and look for tracks. He walked into a clearing and didn't see any tracks.

Larry said to himself \"That was the longest conversation I've ever had with a deer.\" Larry was walking down the street when he saw a dog that was chasing its tail. Larry looked at the dog for a while. He then said to himself \"If I was a dog, I'd chase my tail too.\" Larry went to the zoo and he saw a tiger.

I tried football but it was too many hits.\" The clerk then asked \"What about golf?\" Larry replied \"I don't know, I've never held a club before.\" Larry decided to go camping. He went to the campground and rented a campsite. He set up his tent and started to cook dinner. He had a nice campfire going and he was cooking some steaks.

{"original_text": "Rita accidentally left her smartphone on the plane. She felt terrible about this and knew her parents would be mad. Nobody ever turned in the phone, leaving her disappointed with the human race. Rita was in the middle of a hunt for a new phone when she discovered that we do still have a few honest people in the world. Her iPhone was returned to her completely unharmed. \"I've learned that humanity isn't all bad,\" she said. Rita is a 16-year-old high school student from Atlanta, Georgia. Do you believe in the goodness of people? I am afraid I would be a pessimist and say no. I hope so. So many times, my hope is shattered. The world is full of good and bad people. There is a lot of bad in the world. There is a lot of good in the world. We have to believe that the good will prevail. Everyone has a little good in them. People are good, but sometimes they do bad things. No, I think we are going to destroy ourselves. When a person is in a position to do good and they do not do it, this is a sin of omission. When they are in a position to do bad and they do not do it, this is a sin of commission. Don't forget to do the good. People are inherently good, but there are some that are evil. We have to be able to find good in the world and not just focus on the bad. The thing that makes the good people good is that they don't see themselves as good. They see themselves as regular people that do good things. I believe that there are more good people than bad people. Goodness is not a part of life, it is life itself. When you do good, good things will happen to you. Do the right thing and the rest will follow. Some people have no good in them. A person is just as good as they want to be. I have a faith in the goodness of humanity. I don't think that people are naturally bad. We have to believe in the goodness of people or we will be overrun by the bad. I think that there are a lot more good people than bad. The thing that makes a person good is that they do not see themselves as good. Goodness is an inherent part of life. I believe that people are good, but we have a society that tells us to be bad. What is the good of being good if the rest of the world is bad? I believe that people are naturally good.

If you are good, you will be rewarded. The goodness of the world can be measured by what people do, not what they say. People are not naturally good. I do not believe that there is any good in the world. I believe that there are a lot of good people in the world. There are a lot of good people in the world, but sometimes the bad outweigh the good. I believe that people are naturally good. There is a lot of bad in the world. I try to be good. People are generally good, but there are those that are bad.
