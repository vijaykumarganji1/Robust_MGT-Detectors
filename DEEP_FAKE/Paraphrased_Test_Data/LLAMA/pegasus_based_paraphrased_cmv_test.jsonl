I'm really disappointed that a lot of the people I've talked to don't seem to understand the \"vigilante\" part of \"vigilante justice.\" Yes, this is a horrible tragedy that has caused people to die. But it's hardly something that could have been stopped. People shouldn't be blaming themselves for not being able to read minds and see this coming. The only thing I can think of that could have stopped this is if they had metal detectors at the theater, but even then, he could have just come in with a loaded weapon and just started shooting people. People should take this as a wake up call to be more cautious, but not to feel guilty. There's no one to blame for this tragedy but the shooter. The only thing I can think of that could have stopped this is if they had metal detectors at the theater, but even then, he could have just come in with a loaded weapon and just started shooting people. This is one of those cases where I'm going to have to disagree with you. I don't think that a metal detector would have done anything. The shooter's apartment was booby trapped. He was ready to take his own life. Even if he'd been stopped by a metal detector, he would have still killed a lot of people before he was stopped. I'm not saying metal detectors would have done anything, but it's a pretty big deterrent. It's not going to stop everything, but it's better than nothing. He would have still killed a lot of people before he was stopped, but then those people would have had a better chance of survival. It's not going to stop everything, but it's better than nothing. The people who died at Columbine High School probably would have disagreed with you. I'm not saying that metal detectors are a bad thing. I'm saying that they wouldn't have stopped this. They wouldn't have stopped Columbine, either. If you're determined to kill people, you're going to kill people. I can't say that I agree. I think that the shooter was prepared to die, but I think he was hoping he could escape. I don't think he was completely ready to die, or he would have killed himself. I agree. I don't think he was planning to die. The metal detector would not have stopped him, but it would have at least given people a better chance. I don't think he was completely ready to die, or he would have killed himself. There's no way to know. If he was going to kill himself, he would have done so before the police arrived. I don't think he was prepared to die, either. If he had been, he would have just killed himself and everyone in his apartment instead of setting up a bunch of booby traps and going to the theater. I think that the shooter was prepared to die, but I think he was hoping he could escape. I think that's the most likely scenario. I think it's more likely that he planned to escape, but was ready to die. This is not a good time to disagree with me. I agree, but I'm gonna try anyway.

{"original_text": "I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was a bit shocked to learn that the film is a fictionalized account of what happened. The biggest issue I have is that they made the \"romantic\" relationship between Alan Turing and another character far too dramatic and complicated. I read that in real life the relationship was not like that at all. Other changes they made are much smaller, and I can understand why they made them - to create a better, more interesting narrative. So, I am curious what the community here thinks. Is it just me who feels that a film like this should be as accurate as possible? Or is it acceptable for filmmakers to take a true story and change it for dramatic purposes? I've always said that if a movie is based on a true story, it should be obvious from the very beginning. Even if it's based on a true story, it's still a movie and I don't expect it to be 100 accurate. However, it's not okay if they change the story just to create a more dramatic film. I have to agree with them. Dramatic license has been used in storytelling forever. In my opinion, the only problem that can be had is if the film goes out of it's way to try and make you believe that it is as close to the truth as possible. If the film maker were to admit that it was based on a true story, but was in fact heavily dramatized, I would have no issues with it. But, they are trying to sell you on it being as close to the truth as possible. They are not selling you on it being a dramatization. I'm reminded of the old phrase, \"Based on a true story.\" I have to say I agree with you. It's one thing to take a real story and make it interesting. It's another thing to take a real story and change it to the point that it becomes unrecognizable. I believe the primary reason is to make the story more interesting. But what about a movie where the main character is alive? It's not really the movie's fault, but that the author of the original article falsely claimed that the movie was \"mostly true.\" There's a few instances that I can think of, which have been covered here. I think the main issue is that the more they try to make the film resemble the true story, the more people will question it. I think it's important to note that dramatic license is just a symptom of a much bigger problem. The bigger problem is the desire of filmmakers to push their own viewpoint. Whenever a director wants to make a point in a film, he will always try to twist the facts to suit his narrative. And then there are the people who want to make their political agenda, so they will try to make a movie that portrays their agenda in the best possible light. Sometimes it doesn't even matter if the story they're telling is true or not.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "What do you think about a film that is based on a true story but has been changed in some way to make it more \"dramatic\" and \"accurate\"?"}
{"original_text": "I've seen a few posts lately that refer to the lady who spilled coffee on herself and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and I am completely bemused by the support for the lady. The jury found McDonald's to be 80 responsible and awarded several million dollars compensation, which was later reduced to about 600 000 dollars, and then later settled. Acording to [wikipedia] and another [website] here are the abridged facts of the incident as I understand them. coffee was ordered at a drive through window coffee was handed to Liebeck Liebeck's son drove off they stopped so Liebeck could add sugar Liebeck spilled the entire cup over her lap, hence severely injuring her My argument that it is not McDonald's responsibility is that she had been safely handed the coffee. The transaction was complete and she had control. If the coffee had been spilled during the handover I would view it the other way around. There are two arguments that I reject. I reject that the severity of the injury affects the responsibility. Comments such as \"have you seen those injuries, they're horrific, she had to be reconstructed\" are common. This is true, they were appalling injuries. But I think this is a strawman argument because my point is that it was not McDonald's responsibility after the handover, not that the injuries were minor. I reject that the coffee was too hot. These are hot drinks. It's obvious to me, and I would hope anyone who intends to drink such a drink that it would be hot and care should be given. Perhaps my culture views it differently. I grew up in England, and here 9 and ten year olds make tea for themselves; kettles boil water and then that water is poured into a teapot cup. We know from a young age that this is dangerous and extreme care must be taken when handling such hot water. Indeed, in a similar UK case against McDonald's regarding hot coffee, the judge ruled that McDonald's was not responsible, one of the reasons being that people expect hot drinks to be hot and should make reasonable safety measures themselves. I do not believe Americans don't realise hot water is dangerous. If anyone would like to comment, I'd be happy to elaborate further. I look forward to having interesting discussion. EDIT: Thank you for your replies so far, I'm working my way through replying to them. EDIT: Thank you for your comments and discussion. I have awarded deltas to comments that highlighted arguments that I had not considered. My view is still that McDonald's were not liable for any costs. I have come to the conclusion that the discrepancy is due to a difference in cultural expectations of temperature of served hot drinks.

Happy CMVing!", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "I've seen a few posts lately that refer to the lady who spilled coffee on herself and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and I am completely bemused by the support for the lady. The jury found McDonald's to be 80 responsible and awarded several million dollars compensation, which was later reduced to about 600 000 dollars, and then later settled. Acording to [wikipedia] and another [website] here are the abridged facts of the incident as I understand them. coffee was ordered at a drive through window coffee was handed to Liebeck Liebeck's son drove off they stopped so Liebeck could add sugar Liebeck spilled the entire cup over her lap, hence severely injuring her My argument that it is not McDonald's responsibility is that she had been safely handed the coffee. The transaction was complete and she had control. If the coffee had been spilled during the handover I would view it the other way around. There are two arguments that I reject. I reject that the severity of the injury affects the responsibility. Comments such as \"have you seen those injuries, they're horrific, she had to be reconstructed\" are common. This is true, they were appalling injuries. But I think this is a strawman argument because my point is that it was not McDonald's responsibility after the handover, not that the injuries were minor. I reject that the coffee was too hot. These are hot drinks. It's obvious to me, and I would hope anyone who intends to drink such a drink that it would be hot and care should be given. Perhaps my culture views it differently. I grew up in England, and here 9 and ten year olds make tea for themselves; kettles boil water and then that water is poured into a teapot cup. We know from a young age that this is dangerous and extreme care must be taken when handling such hot water. Indeed, in a similar UK case against McDonald's regarding hot coffee, the judge ruled that McDonald's was not responsible, one of the reasons being that people expect hot drinks to be hot and should make reasonable safety measures themselves. I do not believe Americans don't realise hot water is dangerous. If anyone would like to comment, I'd be happy to elaborate further. I look forward to having interesting discussion. EDIT: Thank you for your replies so far, I'm working my way through replying to them. EDIT: Thank you for your comments and discussion. I have awarded deltas to comments that highlighted arguments that I had not considered. My view is still that McDonald's were not liable for any costs. I have come to the conclusion that the discrepancy is due to a difference in cultural expectations of temperature of served hot drinks.

{"original_text": "Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and is clearly mentally impaired, but we're not going to worry about that right now. They have a Facebook page, and on that Facebook page they post all sorts of racist, homophobic, and general hateful crap. They also are known to post threats of violence and even death, especially towards Jews. Person B is a foreign national from Country A. Person B is a citizen of Country A and has no intention of ever becoming a US citizen. Person C is a US citizen who was born in Country A. Person C has a Facebook page and they see Person A's posts. They also have a Facebook page. They regularly post their agreement with the posts of Person A and they occasionally even expand on those posts. So what does the government of Country A do? They arrest Person C and put them on trial for being a terrorist and a threat to their government. The prosecutors claim that Person C posted statements that threatened the government of Country A and therefore they must be a threat and a terrorist. This is the situation that is currently happening in Turkey. One of the people who has been arrested is an American citizen, a NASA scientist, and American born. The only thing they've done is post comments in support of a group that the Turkish government has determined is a terrorist group. The group in question is a Kurdish group that the Turks have been fighting for years. To me, this sounds a lot like one of the reasons that the US government isn't always too fond of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. It's a terrorist group that's been at war with Israel for decades. Turkey has been going through a lot of changes recently. They've been having a bunch of terrorist attacks by ISIS and they have a strong nationalist streak. This is pretty common in the Middle East. There's been a recent uptick in anti-Americanism in Turkey, a country that used to be one of the US's strongest allies in the region. The Turks are making a move to try and reestablish themselves as a power in the region. They're trying to flex their muscles and this is just one of those things. The only problem is that they're arresting US citizens over it. If this was a case where the US was arresting people for supporting Turkey and the Turkish government then I'd be all over it. I don't think that the US is going to do that, but I have no doubt that if a Turkish citizen was in the US and started posting support for a terrorist group that they'd end up in custody pretty quick. The US has a different definition of terrorism than many other countries, but they do tend to lean more towards what the rest of the world considers terrorism. So why isn't Turkey doing the same thing? They're being kinda hypocritical here.

{"original_text": "Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, so I'd like to hear more counterarguments. First, the general idea behind it is that many people opt out of vaccines for their children, and that reduces the \"herd immunity\" of the general population. (See this article: ) Second, it's not like vaccines are terribly expensive, and I don't see how they are much different from the other requirements for school attendance (such as, for example, the requirement that your child have a haircut or uniform). It seems to me that the parental right to make medical decisions on behalf of their children is not absolute, and that if this right conflicts with the wellbeing of the general public, then the government should step in. (I would like to say that I am not taking a stance here as to whether vaccines are or are not dangerous. I have no idea. I am interested in hearing arguments against the mandatory vaccination, so I don't care about the merits of the claim that vaccines are dangerous.) No need to worry about the merits of the claim that vaccines are dangerous. For the purposes of this discussion, just assume that they are. In any case, as a parent of school-age children, I am less interested in the merits of the claims and more interested in my rights as a parent. I don't think the government has the right to force me to have my child vaccinated. I think the government can encourage it, but not force it. I think it's reasonable for the government to enforce laws that protect the rights of the individual, but not to enforce laws that restrict the rights of the individual. I don't see how this is an area in which the rights of the individual need to be restricted. I think parents should be allowed to make medical decisions on behalf of their children, and that this should not be restricted for the purposes of increasing the herd immunity of the general population. This is one of those cases where I think the state is overstepping its bounds. It should not be the role of the state to dictate that a parent must vaccinate their child. If a parent is a member of a religious group that forbids vaccination then that parent has the freedom to follow the tenets of their faith. I am not a parent and never will be. That said, I am still against this idea. I don't see any reason to force people to do something that they don't want to do. The argument of herd immunity is a load of crap. The only people who suffer because of this are the children of parents who are not vaccinating their children. This does not, however, include the children who have been vaccinated. If the vaccine is not effective, then what is the point of forcing people to get it? It seems to me that these people are trying to justify their own bad decisions. As for religious freedom, I don't know what you're talking about. The constitution is not a religious document. It does not guarantee religious freedom. The First Amendment guarantees the right to freedom of religion. No one has a right to be free from religion.

The only people who suffer because of this are the children of parents who are not vaccinating their children. This is pretty much the best argument against mandatory vaccination. The child who is not vaccinated is the only one who suffers. My initial thought would be that it's not so much about the children's rights, but the parents', that's violated here. However, it could be that the government believes that in the absence of vaccination, those rights would be violated as well. The herd immunity argument is a good one, but if there was no vaccination, and the number of infections was so great as to make them a threat to the entire population, the government could still force vaccinations.

While a lot of the arguments for it It's the oldest profession\"; \"we should have full rights to our bodies don't hold water, I would like to see it legalized for tax purposes. We could even set it up in a way that the taxes are collected on a weekly basis from the \"working girls\" directly. This would accomplish several things. First, it would make the activity taxable, which would likely put many small-time operators out of business. This would drive many of the johns who just want to feel a bit dirty off into the streets, and out of the taxable system. Secondly, it would reduce the impact on the judicial system, allowing it to focus on the real criminals. Thirdly, it would provide a financial incentive for the \"working girls\" to get off the streets and to work in safer environments. Fourthly, it would help us to keep track of the girls, and provide a means of ensuring that they get tested for diseases. Fifthly, it would provide a financial incentive to the girls to use condoms, and to turn down johns who refuse to use them. The only drawback that I can see is the possibility that it would encourage more girls to enter the trade, but I don't think that this would be a big problem. What do you think?

I don't know if it's the best solution but it would seem to be better than the present situation. I wouldn't worry about the thread getting deleted. The folks here are very tolerant. Excellent idea, but I can think of one small flaw: I think if you wanted to increase tax revenues, you would not have to legalize prostitution. What you would need to do is enforce tax laws against those who are currently doing it. Prostitution is going on in every community in the country, whether we want to admit it or not. I think most communities do a poor job of enforcing the law. The problem with legalizing prostitution is that it gives the government the right to regulate it. (i.e. regulate and tax it) I don't think I would want the government to have this right. As it stands now, prostitution is an illegal activity. (In most places) Because it's illegal, the prostitutes and their customers are breaking the law by participating in it. I think that's good. If you don't break the law, the government has no control over you. I don't want the government telling me what I can or can't do with my body. I'm not sure that I would be in favor of legalizing prostitution. Even if it were legal, I don't think I would use the services of a prostitute. I think it would make me feel like a dirty old man. And I know that I would always wonder if the girl enjoyed it or not. I'd be afraid she was just faking it, for the money. I can't stand the thought of a woman faking it. I'd rather just find a nice girl that I could trust. I'm not saying that's the only way to do it. I just feel that's the way I should do it. I think I'd rather just have a nice girlfriend. I'd rather be in a relationship, than just have sex. I think the government should stay out of our sex lives. If you want to have sex, go have sex. Just don't do it with any underage people. And make sure it's safe sex. (Condoms, etc.) I agree that prostitution is an activity that is going on all around us, and I also agree that it is one of those things that the government should stay out of. I don't think that we should use the threat of jail to control people's behavior. That said, I think that taxing the activity would be a good thing.

{"original_text": "I just moved into a new apartment and the fridge-freezer that came with the unit has the freezer on top and the fridge on the bottom as opposed to the fridge on top and freezer on the bottom. Is this a big deal? I'm used to having the freezer on top but I don't really use it that much. I just put my food in the fridge and put frozen foods in the freezer. My food is mostly in the fridge and not the freezer. Should I be concerned about this arrangement? Is the food better preserved by putting it in the fridge first? Is it harder to get to the food in the fridge when it's on the bottom? posted by mattbucher to Food Drink (15 answers total) In terms of temperature, the bottom will be slightly better, since hot air rises. That's about it. I doubt that any food is significantly better-preserved in this arrangement, but I doubt that any food is significantly worse-preserved, either. posted by Class Goat at 12:18 PM on July 27, 2007 Isn't the main difference in this sort of fridge the fact that the freezer is a \"chest\" type, rather than upright, i.e. the door doesn't swing out, it opens down? I think I'd prefer the chest fridge, and I'd say just take advantage of the freezer being easier to get to. I can't think of any particular reason to prefer one over the other. My only suggestion is to make sure that the freezer is located somewhere that the condensation won't drip on anything. posted by kiltedtaco at 12:23 PM on July 27, 2007 My understanding is that the main reason for putting the fridge at the bottom is so that the freezer doesn't need to be opened as much as the fridge, thus preserving temperature better. This is what I've been told, and it seems to make sense. posted by The Deej at 12:23 PM on July 27, 2007 Chest freezers are often cheaper to run. posted by Wolfdog at 12:28 PM on July 27, 2007 I would assume that the \"hot air rises\" thing is not a factor in a closed refrigerator. The heat generated by the compressor and the heat drawn from the refrigerated compartments should be distributed evenly throughout the appliance. posted by Steven C. Den Beste at 12:30 PM on July 27, 2007 Agreed. The only reason to put the fridge on top is to make the freezer more accessible. posted by Dr. Wu at 12:44 PM on July 27, 2007 It is probably not a big deal. I have a fridgefreezer arrangement that is opposite of yours and I have never had a problem with it. The thing I don't like is having to bend down to get into the freezer, but that is a minor annoyance. posted by grouse at 12:47 PM on July 27, 2007 i have the freezer on bottom arrangement and i like it a lot. i keep the things i use more often in the fridge, so i don't have to bend down. also, the freezer is cold and my fridge is cold, so i don't feel like i'm going to freeze when i bend down to get something out of the freezer. posted by misanthropicsarah at 1:16 PM on July 27, 2007 I have the bottom-freezer type and I've had no issues with it. posted by shaun uh at 1:37 PM on July 27, 2007 I prefer the chest freezer configuration, mainly for ergonomic reasons. Also, the chest freezer is usually at a height where the kids can't get in there and open everything up. posted by bondcliff at 2:27 PM on July 27, 2007 Another vote for chest freezers being cheaper to run.

This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 7th century with the prophet Muhammad. After Muhammad's death, Islam spread throughout the Middle East and then into North Africa and other parts of the world. This religion is monotheistic, meaning it teaches that there is only one God. Its adherents are called Muslims, and they are spread throughout the world. Allah is the one and only God of Islam. He is the Creator of all things. He is absolutely just and all-powerful. The Quran, the sacred text of Islam, teaches that the purpose of man's life is to serve Allah. In fact, this is the sole reason for which Allah created man. Islam teaches that Jesus was a prophet and a messenger of Allah. Muslims believe that Jesus was a miracle worker and a great prophet, but not that he was divine. They also believe that he was not crucified but that someone else took his place on the cross. In fact, they believe that Jesus never died but that he was taken into heaven. The Quran teaches that Jesus will come again. However, they do not believe that he will die for the sins of the world, but that he will judge between good and evil. They do not believe that Jesus was divine but that he was a human prophet. Islam teaches that Muhammad was the final prophet sent by Allah to mankind. Muslims believe that Muhammad was the greatest prophet and that he received revelations from Allah. He was born in 570 CE in Mecca. He was orphaned at a young age and was raised by his uncle. When he was about 40 years old, he began to receive revelations from Allah. He shared these revelations with the people of Mecca. He gained a large following. He was the founder of the religion of Islam, and he is considered to be the last prophet. In Islam, everyone is called to repent of their sins and turn to God. Muslims believe that the only way to be right with Allah is to repent of their sins and turn to Him. They believe that Islam is the only true religion, and that it is the duty of every Muslim to share this message with those who are not Muslims. They believe that they must share this message with everyone, even if it means the death of the non-Muslim. Islam is a religion that follows the teachings of the Quran, which is the Word of Allah. It teaches that Allah is the one and only God and that Muhammad was his last prophet. Muslims believe that man's purpose is to serve Allah and that all who die in this service will be rewarded in heaven.

I was pretty annoyed to discover that [aspects of the film's plot were warped for the purpose of making it more dramatic] . I do not think any good comes of this, and to be honest it makes me quite mad. For example, in the film, the main character Alan Turing is portrayed by the actor as obviously autistic to some extent, but according to a quote on Wikipedia (not sure exactly who said it) \"the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film.... bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing.\" This, I think, is insulting to Turing's memory, to customise his personality as to make the film more interesting or to make the audience more sympathetic towards his character. Sometimes it's less minor than character modification. I distinctly remember watching 13 Days (2000) in a high school history class to supplement our Cold War study. This film ramped up the'Soviets are evil and JFK is a god' theme to the point of including an entirely fictional battle scene, but went out of its way to present itself as a historically accurate film, including real Cold War footage throughout.

It's also been criticised for attributing a major role in the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis to Kenneth O'Donnell - somebody who was actually there argues that \"For God's sakes, Kenny O'Donnell didn't have any role whatsoever.... that's absurd.\" I think overblowing or underplaying real people's roles in history is just insulting, and cannot be justified. Thus, I am suggesting that films which are'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred. I will pre-argue some anticipated arguments in advance: \"They're claiming to be based on a true story, not perfectly historically accurate.\" Yes, but these films spread misinformation all the same.

{"original_text": "For context: I am in the UK, so that is the political system I'm most familiar with. I am also NOT very knowledgeable about politics in general, but I have enough of an idea to know what opinions I do and don't agree with. Left-wing views seem to pretty much say that everyone should look after each other. Everyone should do what they are able to and share their skills and resources. That means people who are able to do a lot will support those who can't (e.g. those who are ill, elderly, disabled). The result is that everyone is able to survive happilyhealthily and with equal resources from sharing. Right-wing views seem to pretty much say that everyone is in it for themself. Everyone should be'allowed' to get rich by exploiting others, because everyone has the same opportunities to do that. People that are successful in exploiting othersgetting richetc are just those who have worked the hardest. It then follows that people who are unable to do those things - for example, because they are ill or disabled - should not be helped. Instead, they should \"just try harder\" or \"just get better,\" or at worst \"just die and remove themselves from the gene pool.\" When right-wing people are worried about left-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be allowed to make as much money, or that their money will be taken away. They're basically worried that they won't be able to be better off than everyone else. When left-wing people are worried about right-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be able to survive without others helping and sharing. They are basically worried for their lives. It seems pretty obvious to conclude that right-wing politics are more selfish and dangerous than left-wing politics, based on what people are worried about. How can right-wing politics be reconciled with supporting and caring for ill and disabled people? How do right-wing people justify their politics when they literally cause some people to fear for their lives? Are right-wing politics inherently selfish? Please, change my view! Edit: I want to clarify a bit here. I'm not saying that right-wing people or politicians are necessarily selfish. Arguing that all politicians are selfish in the same way does not change my view (I already agree with that). I'm talking more about right- or left-wing ideas and their theoretical logical conclusions. Imagine a'pure' (though not necessarily authoritarian) right-wing person who was able to perfectly construct the society they thought was ideal - that's the kind of thing I want to understand. Edit 2: There are now officially too many comments for me to read all of them. I'll still read anything that's a top-level reply or a reply to a comment I made, but I'm no longer able to keep track of all the other threads! If you want to make sure I notice something you write that's not a direct reply, tag me in it. Edit 3: I've sort of lost track of the particular posts that helped because I've been trying to read everything. But here is a summary of what I have learnedwhat views have changed: Moral views are distinct from political views - a person's opinion about the role of the government is nothing to do with their opinion about whether people should be cared for or be equal. Most people are basically selfish anyway, but most people also want to do what is right for everyone in their own opinion. Right-wing people (largely) do not actually think that people who can't care for themselves shouldn't be helped. They just believe that private organisations (rather than the government) should be responsible for providing that help. They may be of the opinion that private organisations are more efficient, cheaper, fairer, or better at it than the government in various ways. Right-wing people believe that individuals should have the choice to use their money to help others (by giving to charitable organisations), rather than be forced into it by the government. They would prefer to voluntarily donate lots of money to charity, than to have money taken in the form of taxes which is then used for the same purposes. Hello, users of CMV!

That means people who are able to do a lot will support those who can't (e.g. those who are ill, elderly, disabled). The result is that everyone is able to survive happilyhealthily and with equal resources from sharing. Right-wing views seem to pretty much say that everyone is in it for themself. Everyone should be'allowed' to get rich by exploiting others, because everyone has the same opportunities to do that. People that are successful in exploiting othersgetting richetc are just those who have worked the hardest. It then follows that people who are unable to do those things - for example, because they are ill or disabled - should not be helped. Instead, they should \"just try harder\" or \"just get better,\" or at worst \"just die and remove themselves from the gene pool.\" When right-wing people are worried about left-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be allowed to make as much money, or that their money will be taken away. They're basically worried that they won't be able to be better off than everyone else. When left-wing people are worried about right-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be able to survive without others helping and sharing. They are basically worried for their lives. It seems pretty obvious to conclude that right-wing politics are more selfish and dangerous than left-wing politics, based on what people are worried about. How can right-wing politics be reconciled with supporting and caring for ill and disabled people? How do right-wing people justify their politics when they literally cause some people to fear for their lives? Are right-wing politics inherently selfish? Please, change my view! Edit: I want to clarify a bit here. I'm not saying that right-wing people or politicians are necessarily selfish. Arguing that all politicians are selfish in the same way does not change my view (I already agree with that). I'm talking more about right- or left-wing ideas and their theoretical logical conclusions. Imagine a'pure' (though not necessarily authoritarian) right-wing person who was able to perfectly construct the society they thought was ideal - that's the kind of thing I want to understand. Edit 2: There are now officially too many comments for me to read all of them. I'll still read anything that's a top-level reply or a reply to a comment I made, but I'm no longer able to keep track of all the other threads! If you want to make sure I notice something you write that's not a direct reply, tag me in it. Edit 3: I've sort of lost track of the particular posts that helped because I've been trying to read everything. But here is a summary of what I have learnedwhat views have changed: Moral views are distinct from political views - a person's opinion about the role of the government is nothing to do with their opinion about whether people should be cared for or be equal. Most people are basically selfish anyway, but most people also want to do what is right for everyone in their own opinion. Right-wing people (largely) do not actually think that people who can't care for themselves shouldn't be helped. They just believe that private organisations (rather than the government) should be responsible for providing that help. They may be of the opinion that private organisations are more efficient, cheaper, fairer, or better at it than the government in various ways. Right-wing people believe that individuals should have the choice to use their money to help others (by giving to charitable organisations), rather than be forced into it by the government. They would prefer to voluntarily donate lots of money to charity, than to have money taken in the form of taxes which is then used for the same purposes. Hello, users of CMV!

{"original_text": "The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to understand the original intent of the framers. Fortunately we have the ability to look at other documents, like the Federalist Papers that were written by the same men who wrote the constitution and debate what it meant. We can also look at the state constitutions that were written around the same time as the federal constitution and see what changes they made. In this article we will examine the second amendment to the constitution and look at the purpose of the right to keep and bear arms. We will see that it was originally a right that was given to the states, not to the people. The Second Amendment in modern english is as follows: The right to bear arms was originally a right that the states had, not the people. The founding fathers of this country did not want the federal government to have a standing army. They felt that it was the state militias that were the real army of the country. This is how they viewed it in the Federalist Papers, written at the same time as the constitution. \"Let us advert to the nature of republican government; let us review the natural progress of events in a state that has taken its first steps towards a regular administration of affairs; and we shall at once discover, that the constitution which has introduced a mixed government, contains, also, within itself, the springs of a system of representation, highly favorable to the rights of private citizens, and strongly conducive to the interests of the public. \"As the necessity of a military force, for internal defence and security, is acknowledged and as it must be regarded as a fundamental principle in the constitution, that the provision of military forces shall always be under the direction and at the disposal of the national government, it would seem to follow, of necessity, that the commander in chief of those forces ought to be at least nominally, if not substantially, under the authority of the national government. \"This is an important feature in the constitution of the union, and it will deserve more particular attention when we come to examine the mode of its execution.\" Alexander Hamilton, Federalist 80 This is interesting. This shows that the constitution was not written in stone. Changes could be made to it. Here is what the constitution looked like after the 13th amendment was passed: These amendments are not about the federal government having a standing army. The federal government already had the right to raise an army. What they are talking about is whether or not the states have the right to have standing armies. The 10th amendment says that any powers not explicitly given to the federal government are given to the states or the people. However, the state constitutions of that time did not recognize the people as having rights. The 14th amendment was added later to give rights to the people, but it was not added until 1868, 80 years after the second amendment was passed. The Supreme Court has made a decision on whether or not the 2nd amendment applies to individuals. In the case of DC v. Heller, the court ruled that it does. You can read the decision here. The question at issue is what does keep and bear arms mean? In this case, the court had to decide if the keep and bear arms clause of the second amendment applied to weapons other than those that were used by the militia. These are the guns that are commonly carried by private citizens. The court said that the right to keep and bear arms means that a person has the right to keep and bear any kind of arm that is commonly used by private citizens. \"Putting all of these textual elements together, we find that they guarantee the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.

I think this is not only not really helpful to a person or group of persons who are facing adversity, it is detrimental. It causes issues that could be making actual progress to falter and nit-pick all of the tiniest little problems they can find rather than strive for real change.

This post was inspired by the earlier discussion on the use of the word \"cisgendered\" and wether it is \"normal\" or wether we should then be differentiating the difference between diabetics and nondiabetics and so forth. I don't think this is a helpful debate overall. sure, if you are asking what gender someone is, it is okay, even good, to distinguish, but all I keep seeing around here, and in real life, and at an increasing rate, is how we all need to check our privilege and be more and more sympathetic; how white people can't relate to minority problems, men can't relate to women's suffrage, cisgendered people can't really understand what transgendered people go through... it just keeps getting more and more specific, and in my opinion, its just focussing everyone's attention on what is wrong with the world, and doesn't actually help us make it better.

{"original_text": "We hear it time and time again every new year. Our closest friends and families making new years resolutions. While I encourage people in improving themselves, I hate the idea of New Year's Resolutions. I believe overall, new years resolutions only serve to discourage people from actually achieving goals and is based on faulty reasoning. [45 of Americans make resolutions every new year.] Yet just a paltry 8 of them achieve their resolution. While I applaud those 8, I fail to understand why they couldn't have done this at any other point during the year. And while I don't have the proof, I'm willing to bet that those same 8 would have improved just as much if they decided to commit to a goal at any other point in the year. Here's why I believe New Year's Resolutions are almost always destined to fail. Every NYR requires: 1. Wait until the new year starts. This absurdity alone should put this to bed. There's no rhyme or reason to wait until the arbitrary beginning of a calendar system to start something. I believe most people simply want that last week before their resolution comes into \"effect\" to gorge on unhealthy food while they still can, smoke cigarettes while they can, etc. Then: 2. The second the New Year starts, your life is supposed to automatically change forever. The second the clock strikes 12, that's it. No more cigarettes, no more junk food. Ever. Why? Why introduce such a drastic change on a whim like that? What is the reasoning? Why not make steady improvements over time instead of unleashing hell on yourself all at once?

{"original_text": "This comes from a person who has seen family members kill themselves, and try to kill themselves. I was also clinically depressed as a teen due to a medical diagnosis. From what I can tell of the issue; suicide is a decision a person makes when they give up. I realize that is a HUGE oversimplification of a very very complicated issue, but let me clarify my point. Suicide is related to mental illness yes, but I understand it is a choice. Mentally Ill people have chemical imbalances in their brain, but I don't think that makes them incapable of free will. They still actively chose to kill themselves in a specific way or fashion with all factors considered. A way I see it is; a drunk person is still liable for any crimes they did while drunk, even though there is an imbalance of chemicals in their brain. (Although I am unsure if that is because a person chooses to get inebriated, while a mentally Ill person is born with it) Since they have chosen to kill themselves, why don't they choose to actively improve their situation? Call me an optimist but I sincerely believe that if a person tries with the best of their ability, they can improve how they live. Now a mentally ill person may not think like that at all. But that doesn't change that they chose to die over choosing to strive for a better life. Suicide is weakness in my mind, because it is a choice.

I was also clinically depressed as a teen due to a medical diagnosis. From what I can tell of the issue; suicide is a decision a person makes when they give up. I realize that is a HUGE oversimplification of a very very complicated issue, but let me clarify my point. Suicide is related to mental illness yes, but I understand it is a choice. Mentally Ill people have chemical imbalances in their brain, but I don't think that makes them incapable of free will. They still actively chose to kill themselves in a specific way or fashion with all factors considered. A way I see it is; a drunk person is still liable for any crimes they did while drunk, even though there is an imbalance of chemicals in their brain. (Although I am unsure if that is because a person chooses to get inebriated, while a mentally Ill person is born with it) Since they have chosen to kill themselves, why don't they choose to actively improve their situation? Call me an optimist but I sincerely believe that if a person tries with the best of their ability, they can improve how they live. Now a mentally ill person may not think like that at all. But that doesn't change that they chose to die over choosing to strive for a better life. Suicide is weakness in my mind, because it is a choice.

{"original_text": "A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange.

Children (and I define that in this case as everyone under 18) are not nearly responsible enough to handle them. There is a reason we do not let little children drive cars or drink alcohol etc. Childrens Brains (and even young adult's, but you have to draw the line somewhere) are still in the process of developing. We all have done stupid shit as children. Hell, just here on reddit I read about some guy who shot his brother twice as a kid. You may choose not be believe that story, but for me it seems plausible. I know btw that the Instructor in this case made some critical mistakes as well, and that children shooting firearms have to be supervised. But still, if the Girl had the experiance, wisdom and patience that comes with being an adult, this would have never happened. An adult acts as another layer of protection to prevent an accident. In my view, having a child handle a firearm is a little like not exercising proper trigger discipline. If you do everything else right, nothing bad can really happen. But you should never rely on doing everything else right. You might know some very mature and patient 14 year old who is really interested in hunting or sport shooting. In that case, congratulations. But I still stand by my view that that kid should wait and grow four more years. Sure, they might not get to shoot for four your years, but nobody will die. EDIT: ucaw81 has slightly changed my view.

They are asking for support for their decision to leave an abusive situation. There is no \"correct\" answer. They aren't even asking for a decision. The most helpful answer was, \"I think you should leave and here's why.\" There are plenty of downvotes on that question and on the accepted answer that says just that. What's wrong with that? That question and answer is helpful to the asker and people in similar situations. Those downvotes are unhelpful. \"Fair\" We need to have a community to decide what content is good for that community. Downvotes let people communicate what they think is good and bad for the community. Example: A question about how to make a toaster work when you're not supposed to be putting toast in it is probably not the kind of question that is good for a site about relationships. Voting down questions like that makes it clear that that question is not good for the community. I think we can have both. I don't think the downvote button should be removed. I do think that people should think about why they're downvoting before they do. If they're just disagreeing with an answer or question, they shouldn't downvote. If they're saying, \"This isn't good for the community,\" they should downvote. I agree with you, we should be able to vote for what we think is helpful or unhelpful for the site. We've put a lot of thought into it and have a clear definition for \"unhelpful.\" It's ok to disagree with the decision but the community has decided it's unhelpful. Now, if the community disagrees with the definition of unhelpful, the community can change it. The community has been doing a great job of voting for what they think is helpful and unhelpful. So, I think it's really great that you're trying to educate people on when to use the vote button but I think the current definition of unhelpful is clear. - Krysta Aug 25 '18 at 21:01 Krysta I'm glad we're agreeing. I still think that we need to be able to communicate what we think is helpful for the community. I think the definition of unhelpful is not that clear. For example, I think that question that I linked to is really good for the site. It's good because it's a real and common problem and the answer is really helpful. - Catija Aug 25 '18 at 21:05 This is a great answer. I'm glad to see your feedback. - Catija Aug 27 '18 at 18:38 I agree that there's some confusion about how to use the downvote button. However, I think that it's a very small subset of the community that isn't using it correctly. I think that overall, the community is doing a great job of using the vote buttons. We've tried to be clear about how we use the vote buttons in the help center. The help center is also linked to in the voting tooltip. Voting helps future visitors find the answers they need, and it helps the community decide which questions are appropriate for the site. When you see good content, vote it up by clicking the arrow next to the answer's score. When you see bad content, vote it down by clicking the arrow next to the answer's score. \"Bad\" content could be An answer that is incorrect, misleading or unhelpful. Content that doesn't belong on Interpersonal Skills. Any question that doesn't meet the minimum quality standards. If you see content that isn't \"bad\" but isn't as good as the content that you've read, that's not an appropriate reason to downvote. The community has decided that an answer is bad and deserves a downvote when: The answer is invalid for the question. The answer is wrong. The answer is not helpful. If the answer doesn't meet the minimum quality standards (below). If the answer is offensive or disrespectful. If the answer is off topic. If the answer is a question.

First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this in future posts!). I also want to say that this is the first time I have ever joined a political party and feel that I have finally found one that I agree with! I have been searching for a party that supports a true free market economy, personal freedom and choice and the UK's membership of the EU - and I believe that the CMV is the only party to do so! In terms of the CMV's policies I am totally in favour of them. I have always been a proponent of the right to self determination and I believe the CMV policies on this matter are a good way to address the current issues that Scotland and Wales face. I have already been involved in some CMV activism and I hope to do more in the future. I believe that the CMV has a great future and hope to be a part of it! A warm welcome to our newest member.

{"original_text": "I'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. If we can't pay them back, it's no problem, the government will just pick up the tab. This leads to an increase in the cost of college, which leads to more loans, which leads to an increase in the cost of college, etc. In 2007, the average graduate from a 4 year public university owed about 20,000. In 2011, the average was over 26,000. The most drastic increase has been among for-profit universities, where the average debt is now 39,950. I'm not here to criticize the amount of debt students have, since I owe a good deal of money myself. The bigger concern is that student loans are far too easy to get. In fact, the Stafford loan is literally the easiest loan to get. The whole system is a vicious cycle. It's hard to get scholarships if you can't afford college. If you can't afford college, you must take out loans. If you take out loans, you'll have to take out more loans, so you'll have to earn more money, so you'll have to get an even better degree, so you'll have to take out even more loans. It doesn't matter if you can't afford to pay them back, because the government will pay them for you. There's no way to fix the problem. A student loan bubble bursting would be the worst thing possible for the economy, and it's inevitable. I'm not sure if we can prevent it from bursting, but if we do manage to prevent it, it will only prolong the inevitable. Either way, the best thing to do is to prepare yourself. If you're planning to go to college, try to save up as much money as possible beforehand. Also, know that you can't trust the government to help you if you can't pay back your loans. The government can't fix every problem. Posted by Edgar at 12:18 PM I agree with you. It seems to be a vicious cycle. I wonder, though, if we should even think of it as a problem. Is it really a problem? People want to go to college, but can't afford it. If people want to go to college and are willing to take out the loans, why should they not? The problem is that people can't afford to pay back the loans. They take out loans and then cannot pay back the loans. It seems that you have a solution. They should save up. But if they can't afford to go to college, how can they save up to go to college? It seems that the real problem is that people are not getting jobs that pay enough for them to pay back their loans. The real problem is that the jobs available are not jobs that pay well enough for people to afford to pay back their loans. If this is the case, the real solution is to create more jobs that pay well enough for people to afford to pay back their loans. I think the problem is not the loans, but the jobs. I don't necessarily think the jobs are the problem. If a student gets a loan to pay for college, it's their responsibility to pay it back, no matter what job they have. Also, some jobs don't require a college degree. If you go to college to be a nurse, there's no guarantee you'll be able to pay back your loans. It's not necessarily the job itself, but the person's ability to pay back the loan. If someone has 100,000 in debt, no job will pay enough for them to pay it back. It's the person's responsibility to make sure they can pay back their loans. If they can't, they shouldn't get the loan. I agree with you, Edgar, that people should be responsible for their loans. But, if people are not getting the jobs that pay enough for them to pay back the loans, it is the government's responsibility to make sure that the people have jobs that pay enough for them to pay back the loans. The loans are not the problem. The jobs are the problem. The government shouldn't be responsible for people getting jobs. A job is just a job. There's no such thing as a \"good\" job.

For example, if a white-owned business wanted to deny service to all minorities, that would be their prerogative. Likewise, if a minority-owned business wanted to deny service to whites, it should be their prerogative. I don't think this is a good business practice, and I hope that the boycotts of any businesses that choose this path would effectively put them out of business, but I believe that, as a matter of principle, it should be legal. If the government were to pass laws stating that businesses could not discriminate against any group, it would be a violation of the rights of the business owner to conduct business as he or she sees fit. I think that many people want to take this position because they believe that the government should not intervene in the private sector, and I agree with this. But I also believe that the government should not intervene in the private sector by FORCING businesses to accept any customers they don't want to. I hope that this position will not be interpreted as racist.

For example, I think that marijuana should be legal. It's not immoral. There are many things that are legal that are moral. For example, wearing a seat belt is legal, and I think that it's moral for everyone to wear a seat belt. There are many things that are moral, but aren't legal.

I have read a lot about the 1930s in Germany and there are some similarities to the current USA, but it is not the same. The similarities could be used to warn and educate people. Just as a side note, and if I am wrong, please correct me. But I thought that a lot of the German people felt like they were part of a \"special\" group. Maybe that is why they followed Hitler.

{"original_text": "Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than other countries. The case of nationalism within Europe is doubly so, and it is not an uncommon phenomenon. It is perfectly understandable that if one group of people is told for years that they are better than another group of people that they will come to believe it. It is the case, of course, that the British would not believe that they are better than the Germans in any way. It is not the British nationalism that I am talking about, but the nationalism of the other countries in Europe. Britain, of course, is so superior to the other nations that it is not even allowed to use the Euro. In some ways it is a shame, but in others it is a good thing. The pound is still a well-respected currency and it is a shame that Britain is unable to use the Euro. But then again, the British economy is in such a state that if it had been using the Euro, it would have been in a worse state. The advantages of using the Euro are many. The biggest one is that it is just easier to exchange money. While British people have to change their money when they go abroad, European people are able to travel and use their money anywhere in Europe. There are also economic advantages. The Eurozone is effectively a single economy. It is a huge market in which things can be bought and sold. If Britain joins the Euro, it will be able to compete on an even playing field. However, there are also disadvantages. One of them is that it has led to Germany being in charge. Since the Euro was started, Germany has been the strongest economy. This means that it has been able to influence the economic policies of other countries. This has led to the current situation in which Germany is in control. It is a shame for European countries. It would have been better if the influence had been evenly spread between the countries. In the early days of the Euro, it looked as if France would be in control, but then the French economy started to falter. The other big problem with the Euro is the Greek situation. Greece is not, at the moment, able to pay its debts. The other countries in the Eurozone have been forced to pay for the mistake of the Greeks. The Greeks spent too much money. When they ran out of money, they tried to borrow some from other countries. The other countries refused, but they were forced to give the money to the Greeks anyway. It is a shame for the Greeks, but also a shame for the other countries in the Eurozone who have had to pay for the Greeks' mistakes. The Euro is not perfect. It has its problems. But it is better than other systems. The British should join the Eurozone. The country will be stronger for it. There are certain things that everyone knows. One of them is that the French are cowardly. It is a fact that the French army has never won a battle. When the Germans invade France, the French army is so scared that they run away. They cannot even fight the little Belgians. It is a fact that if you go to a war, you will always find the French soldiers hiding in a ditch. Everyone knows this. It is not even an issue. It is just how the French are. The French are not even brave when they are not fighting. It is a fact that the French are all cowards. The French are so cowardly that they do not even have the courage to fight for their country. When the British were at war with Germany, the French did not fight. They just hid in a ditch and waited for the Germans to arrive. It is a fact that the British have to do all the fighting. It is the British who have to go and fight the Germans. It is the British who have to go and fight in Afghanistan. It is the British who have to go and fight in Iraq. Everyone knows that the French are too scared to fight. The British have to do all the fighting. It is a fact that the French are so cowardly that they do not even have the courage to live in France. The French who are not brave enough to fight the Germans have to leave their country to live in Britain. It is a fact that the French are so cowardly that they are too scared to live in France. This is why the French have to come to Britain. The French are too scared to fight for their country. The French are too scared to live in their own country. It is a fact that the French are too cowardly to do anything.

I want to see the truth and I'm not getting it. I'm getting just as much \"blue lies matter\" crap as I'm getting \"black lies matter.\" I am a mother of a 16 year old son who has been \"detained\" by police twice for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The first time was because he was seen running away from a car that was known to police. He was just walking through a neighborhood on his way home. The second time he was in the backseat of a car of a friend that was speeding. He was a passenger. Luckily for him the police were being called \"pigs\" and \"jackasses\" from the backseat of the car by his friend. My son was arrested for being in a stolen car but the boy who was driving was charged with possession of marijuana. It was my son's first offense so he got community service. What really got me was how the police treated him. He was handcuffed in the backseat of a police car for hours. The officer in the car with him was telling him how stupid he was for being in that car. I was furious. I was also furious that the officer didn't know that my son had no record. My son was still wearing his school uniform. He is in a Catholic school. He had an interview at 5 pm that day for a job. He has never been in trouble before. He is a good kid. The cops don't know that. I'm not saying that he was in the wrong for being in that car. He made a bad decision. He learned his lesson and he is now aware of his actions. But the police were also in the wrong. I'm white. I am a white woman with a white son. I know that my son will not be shot and killed by the police because he is white. That doesn't mean I am exempt from feeling pain when I see a child shot by a cop. I am a parent. I feel the pain of the parents and the friends and the family members. I feel for the police officers too. I am married to a man who had a childhood friend that became a police officer. My son was in the police explorer program at school. The police are there to protect and serve. I know that there are some officers who will do anything to protect and serve. I know that there are some officers who will do anything to protect themselves. The police are there to protect and serve. They are not there to harass. They are not there to shoot first and ask questions later. They are not there to hide behind their badges.

Now the current generation is trying to rediscover America's cities and since no one likes paying 2000month for a studio apartment they are moving into the neighborhoods that have the proximity to the city life they want without paying an arm and a leg for it and since previous generations of middle-class Americans seemed unwilling to live alongside the working class shouldn't this change in attitudes be applauded rather than derided?

{"original_text": "First off let me reiterate that I am talking about the ACADEMIC study of religion. I could give a fuck about theology and dogmatic tradition. What I care about is the philosophical core of religion: understanding and bringing about religious experience. The first thing that brings me to this idea is that, contrary to popular belief, science in no way has ever claimed it was truth. People have decided that it was, but all science does is create a model to make predictions. If those predictions work, then we can create tools with the model. We know very well that quantum mechanics and relativity theory are not \"true\" because they are incompatible. What they do is allow us to make predictions and therefore tools. These tools have helped us out, no doubt. But I believe that we need to shift our entire way of thinking from an understanding nature to an experiential nature. My favorite scientist, Werner Heisenberg, has this to say about it: \"The existing scientific concepts cover always only a very limited part of reality, and the other part that has not yet been understood is infinite.\" The other part is infinite. We can either keep going down a path of trying to figure out this fractal-like void of knowledge, which we are not capable in the least of doing biologically, or we can try to experience rather than understand our existence. This is done through the study of religions. Religions are all an attempt to explain an experience or set of experiences that people have. This includes Judeo-Christian, Pagan, Eastern, any sort of thought. What they are all attempting to do, at their core, is bring about the experience of something. Judeo-Christian thought wants to bring about heaven, and as Jesus says in the Gospel of Thomas (which is just as legitimate as any other text) the kingdom of heaven is here. The Qu'ran says turn your head in every direction and there you see the face of Allah. Buddhism speaks of Nirvana, Hinduism speaks of Moksha, Taoism of the sage, all of these are experiences of the one-like nature of the universe. That brings us back to Heisenberg \"There is a fundamental error in separating the parts from the whole, the mistake of atomizing what should not be atomized. Unity and complementarity constitute reality.\" Science, religion, they all talk about the unity. What we cannot do, according to Heisenberg and science, is understand. We can, as he says \"speak of it in images and parables.\" Sounds a lot like religion. We can understand that the big picture is completely unfathomable, and realize that what we really should do is experience the big picture through the study of religion. Maybe this is Judeo-Christian charity. Maybe this is Eastern meditation. Maybe its a good fuck or a nice view or dancing around. I don't care what your method of experience is, but religions are the study of this experience. They provide ways to bring about the experience. These experiences are just as \"real\" as anything else. You simply cannot say that I have not had religious, unexplainable (other than what I would call magic) experiences with the love of my life on top of a skyscraper in Tokyo 15,000 miles away from home. You cannot say that Ayrton Senna did not \"see god\" as he says all the time about him winning F1 races. You cannot say that someone dancing around losing themselves completely on acid at a Grateful Dead show did not have an unexplainable religious experience. These experiences are all real, and are all attempted to be explained by religious studies. Maybe Senna did not see a Christian god. But he had a religious experience, he experienced something and attempted to explain it with is home tradition that he had heard his entire life. The academic study of religion is important to this entire realm of experience. We need to study these experiences, and maybe even make them our goal as a culture. I am not saying science sucks and we should abandon it. It creates great tools and has helped us immensely. But it is an upaya, (in the Buddhist term) a tool. It is a great thing, but we cannot lose sight of the equally sized realm of experience that is studied through religion. Religious study is also upaya, and we should use it where it is helpful.

I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing himher, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen.

{"original_text": "The general consensus with frame rates greater than 24 or 30 fps in live action work is that it sucks. The illusion of a flickery alternate world breaks down when it's too high. But with animation, whether it's CG or hand drawn, it's a different story. Most of the animated feature films coming out these days are running at 24 fps. Including the recent DisneyPixar release \"Ratatouille,\" which runs at 48 fps. There's a very simple explanation why this is the case. And it has nothing to do with what the filmmakers want. A hand drawn image is captured on a piece of film. When that film is scanned into a computer, the computer does not know it is a moving image. It just sees a bunch of still pictures. And since the computer has no idea how many frames it has to generate to match the original film frame rate, it defaults to 24 fps.

And it's a huge problem. You see, the computer will take that 12 fps film and convert it to 24 fps by doubling the number of frames.

This is called \"replacement.\" And since this new digital version of your film has the same frame rate as the original film, the illusion of motion is maintained.

R.I.P. Tyson I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. Does anyone have a convincing argument that it was? You clearly didn't read the details or you would have grasped it. \"The 80-year-old woman suffered third-degree burns on six percent of her skin and lesser burns over sixteen percent.[6] She spent eight days in the hospital before being transferred to a nursing home for skin grafts. During this period, she underwent debridement (removal of dead skin) and whirlpool treatment (to remove dead skin and promote healing).\" \"Liebeck's medical expenses were 10,500; she lost 20 of her body weight, decreasing from 145 to 111 pounds (10.5 stone). She said she was unable to work for two years. In 1994, she sought to file suit against the McDonald's Corporation, the owner and operator of the restaurant where she purchased the coffee. McDonald's refused to settle, and a jury trial was held. \"At trial, the parties entered into stipulations that, if the jury found for the plaintiff, would be used to determine the amount of damages. These included: McDonald's sold 2.7 million cups of coffee a day in the U.S. at that time, all at the same 190 F (88 C) temperature as the cup that caused Liebeck's injuries. The temperature of the coffee was not a material factor in most claims because burns occurred too rapidly for consumers to suffer prolonged exposure to the coffee. The number of people burned by McDonald's coffee each year was not known but was assumed to be \"statistically insignificant.\" After the trial, the jury awarded Liebeck 200,000 in compensatory damages - reduced to 160,000 because the jury found Liebeck 20 percent at fault - and 2.7 million in punitive damages, for a total of 2.9 million.[6] These amounts were later reduced by the presiding judge to 160,000 and 480,000 respectively, for a total of 640,000. The judge reduced the punitive damages amount after finding it to be excessive in relation to compensatory damages, but affirmed the compensatory damages amount.\" So the jury found McDonalds 20 at fault because of her actions.

I have no doubt that the woman suffered severe burns, and I have no doubt that it was negligent of McDonald's to serve the coffee at such a temperature. I'm saying that she should bear a certain amount of blame for the incident since it was her actions that led to the spill. That's why I'm asking the question. Am I missing something, or is that simply the way the system works? Quote from: Inati on August 22, 2013, 05:41:58 PM If someone is being negligent and you act negligently also, you are partially at fault. This is why I don't believe the woman was at fault. If McDonald's had served the coffee at a reasonable temperature, it wouldn't have mattered what she did with it. I'm not arguing that they weren't negligent, just that the woman was. At what temperature should it be served?

{"original_text": "First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that even many of the violent criminals who are jailed don't need to be locked up for as long to prevent them from being an immediate or persistent threat. In fact, I believe that long term incarceration under harsh conditions is something which actually causes further social harm - directly to the person incarcerated and to the society which the prisoner will be released into after an extended period of incarceration. Also, if the person has dependents, they too might suffer more if their material needs are not adequately provided for. Subsequently, if some sort of punishment is required for violating some sort of socially accepted institution, then I feel that some form of shaming, shunning, and exile are possibly effective alternatives to prevent crime before we decide to incarcerate someone for an extended period of time or issue fines which they may not be able to pay. One advantage to this approach is that the punishment is more directly democratic. It's not a punishment which is wholly issued by a sitting judge who is appointed to represent the public and who arbitrarily decides a perpetrator's fate. Rather, the perpetrator, by agreeing to make public their offense, can still receive a certain degree of sympathy and forgiveness. And if they are shunned or exiled (for some indeterminate amount of time), then other members of the public can go along with that punishment to a degree they see fit. Granted, with shunning or exile the punishment would work much better with social cohesion, but if it were the accepted form of punishment then shunning or exile might be more readily accepted and enforced by the general population of an area. Admittedly, this is an aspect of society which would probably have to be reformed or evolve if a society chose to move away from incarceration, corporal punishment, and excessive fines.

{"original_text": "The U.S. Constitution is an old document. At the time it was written, it made a lot of sense, and it was a large jump ahead for democracy, politics, and human rights at the time. There is no doubt about that. However, the world has changed and the U.S. Constitution should change with it. It is not as relevant today as it was when it was first written. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is a good example. Sure, it made sense to have the Second Amendment at the time the Constitution was written, but today it doesn't. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states: The Second Amendment was written and passed in the late 1700s. At the time it was written, the United States had just had a revolution. The early Americans had just fought a war against the British Empire. The British had tried to disarm the American settlers, and there was a good reason for this. If the British Empire could disarm the colonists, it would be easier to control them. It would also be easier to tax them and exploit them. The British wanted the settlers to be dependent upon them, rather than independent. It's a lot easier to enslave someone if they can't defend themselves. So, the early American settlers had just fought a war against the British Empire, and they had just won it. They had just won their independence from the British Empire. They wanted to keep their guns, and they didn't want to be disarmed by any government. So, they added the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to make sure that they were allowed to keep their guns. Of course, there were other reasons too. There were Native American Indians in America. The colonists were afraid of them. They wanted to keep their guns so that they could protect themselves from Native American Indians, who were trying to protect their land from the colonists. They also wanted to protect their land from the Spanish and French. They had just won a war against the British Empire, but they were afraid of the Spanish, the French, and the Native American Indians. So, they wanted to keep their guns. They wanted to make sure that no government could take their guns away from them. The early Americans did not trust their government. They did not trust the King of England, and they did not trust any government. They had just fought a war against the government, and they wanted to make sure that they could not be disarmed. At the time it was written, the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution made a lot of sense. At the time, it was a very good thing. However, it is not relevant today. It is not as relevant today as it was when it was first written. In the 21st century, we need to change the U.S. Constitution to keep up with the times. In the 21st century, we need to change the Second Amendment, because the U.S. Constitution is an old document. It is not as relevant today as it was when it was first written. We need to change the Second Amendment. It is no longer relevant today, and it needs to be changed. To change the Second Amendment, we need to start by electing the right people to public office. We need to elect people who want to change the Second Amendment. We need to elect people who want to make the world a better place. The U.S. Constitution is a good document. However, it is an old document, and it is not as relevant today as it was when it was first written. We need to change the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, because the world has changed.

{"original_text": "My girlfriend's roommate is a Kindergarten teacher in a very large US City who came home practically sobbing because of one of the kids in her class. The kid's mother had told him that Barack Obama is going to take all of the guns away. The 5-year-old is so scared that he asked the teacher if he should \"kill himself now because Barack Obama is going to take all of our guns away.\" The teacher spent 15 minutes trying to calm the child down and assure him that Barack Obama is not going to take away his guns. Damn that liar! A Democrat said... Surely it was a 5 year old Republican that was upset... I hope that's not true... I do have to say that I've been hearing this rumor for quite some time now - even before the election. I've been hearing it from people who I would never expect to believe such a thing. I'm sorry to say, but it is true. I teach a kindergarten class and a boy in my room told me that his Dad told him that Obama is going to take his guns away. The boy was very upset and was asking me if he had to be worried that Obama was going to take his guns. I told him that Obama was not going to take his guns away. I told him that there is no way that Obama could take away guns. I told him that he needed to ask his Dad where he had heard that. The boy was still very upset. He was begging me to tell him that Obama was not going to take his guns away. I have to say that I am a strong supporter of the second amendment. I am also a strong supporter of the first amendment and the fourth amendment. I am also a strong supporter of the rest of the constitution. I know that this is a rumor that has been circulating for a while, but this is the first time that I have actually heard it from a student. I am a fifth grade teacher in a small town. My kids are not nearly as sheltered as one would think. They do not hear much at home about politics, but they hear it from each other. I also have a classroom that has a TV. My kids have started to ask questions about Obama. Mostly the kids are interested in his family. Their questions are very simple. How many kids does he have? My kids are very interested in the fact that he is going to be the first African-American president. My kids have also asked me if he is Muslim. I tell them that he is Christian and they seem very happy with that. I have not heard that rumor in my classroom, but I am sure that I will. I am very careful in what I say. I tell them that the constitution states that the president must be a natural born citizen. I tell them that Obama is a natural born citizen because he was born in the United States.

My kids have started to ask questions about Obama. Mostly the kids are interested in his family. Their questions are very simple. How many kids does he have? My kids are very interested in the fact that he is going to be the first African-American president. My kids have also asked me if he is Muslim. I tell them that he is Christian and they seem very happy with that. I have not heard that rumor in my classroom, but I am sure that I will. I am very careful in what I say.

It is not the job of the government to make these decisions. It is up to the individual. I agree with you that we, as individuals, have the right to make our own decisions. That is why I said \"we\" as a society. This issue goes back to the OP, with its mention of \"ethics.\" The government has no ethics; it has no soul; it has no conscience. The individuals who make up the government may have ethics, souls, and consciences; but when they are working for the government, they must leave those things at the door. Government is a bureaucracy. It is not personal, it is impersonal. It is my belief that we, as a society, have to decide how to best use our limited resources. Whether we do that as individuals or through our government is up for debate. I agree. We do not need to have these discussions and decisions made by bureaucrats. We already have enough laws and regulations. We, as a society, should have discussions and make decisions as a society. We can do that by voting for people who share our viewpoints, by writing and calling our elected officials, and by expressing our opinions. As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not an ethical use of our resources. We have the same resources we had 300 years ago. We just have a lot more people. I think it is an ethical use of resources to save a life, but it is not the government's role to tell people how to spend their resources, whether it is for healthcare, housing, or food. As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not an ethical use of our resources. It is hard for most people to make these decisions and many would rather not. The government, however, should make decisions based on the best interests of all the citizens. That means making hard decisions about limited resources. Your argument would only be valid if you could prove that the money was going to a child that was unlikely to recover. However, since that is impossible, you cannot make that decision for someone else. No one knows if they will recover from a medical condition. It is possible for someone to get a terminal cancer diagnosis and then live for years. It is also possible for someone to be perfectly healthy and then die unexpectedly. We have a problem in this country. We are all taught to think that doctors are the most important person when it comes to medical decisions. But doctors do not have a crystal ball that will tell them the future. Doctors don't know if a patient will survive, and that is why they are against putting a time limit on medical care. This is why we should not make health care decisions based on money. Everyone knows that medical expenses will continue to increase at a rate that outstrips inflation. That is a fact. It is not reasonable to expect that the government is going to be able to provide an unlimited amount of money for medical care. There will come a time when the government cannot afford the rising costs. This is why the government cannot make decisions about who should and who should not get medical care. What you are suggesting is eugenics. The government cannot decide who should get medical care and who should not get medical care. That is not their job.

On one hand, you've got this wonderful technology that allows you to re-connect with high school friends and distant relatives. On the other hand, your boss knows your friends - and your friends can get you fired. Firing employees for their Facebook posts is nothing new. According to a 2012 survey by research firm Gartner, 70 of US companies monitor employee social media use, with nearly half of those companies actually disciplining employees for their Facebook posts. [The case of Mark Zuckerberg's stolen laptop] At 11pm on Monday, February 15th, a 20-year-old man named Edouard Slipenchy quietly opened a door to a building on the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, walked up to a desk on the second floor, and swiped a laptop that was sitting there. The laptop belonged to a Harvard senior named Mark Zuckerberg, and it contained the code for a website that would soon be worth billions of dollars. Slipenchy, a student at nearby Boston University, was quickly arrested, pleaded guilty to breaking and entering, and spent 150 days in jail. That was the end of the story - or so it seemed. The police never told Zuckerberg that they had recovered his laptop, and he never asked about it. Until now, he was unaware that his laptop was missing. But Zuckerberg's invention, Facebook, had become a monster. It had grown from a site for Harvard students to a site with 65 million users, and its popularity had attracted the attention of a small company called ConnectU, which was claiming that Zuckerberg had stolen the idea for Facebook. ConnectU was owned by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, two identical-twin Harvard graduates who had been Zuckerberg's classmates. They had hired him to write code for their own social networking site, but the work relationship had deteriorated, and Zuckerberg stopped working on their site. Soon after, he launched Facebook. The twins were furious, and they filed a lawsuit claiming that Zuckerberg had stolen their idea. On February 2nd, 2005, four days before Slipenchy broke into his office, Zuckerberg was served with a subpoena in the lawsuit, and told that he had to turn over his Harvard emails, instant messages, and any other documents that might have been relevant to the lawsuit. He ignored the subpoena. A week later, he announced that he was moving Facebook to Palo Alto, California. The next day, Harvard's police department called to say that Slipenchy had been arrested. He was on his way to California, they told Zuckerberg, and he was carrying Zuckerberg's laptop. The FBI was now involved, and they were demanding that Zuckerberg hand over the contents of his laptop. But there was a problem: he had never gotten around to turning over the emails and documents from his Harvard days. So he was in a bind. He knew that if he gave the FBI his Harvard emails, the twins would see them too. He asked the FBI for more time. And they agreed. Fourteen months later, the FBI agents came back to Zuckerberg. This time they were accompanied by a lawyer representing the Winklevosses. Zuckerberg said he had no emails or documents. The twins' lawyer, however, had a copy of a Harvard Crimson article that quoted Zuckerberg saying, \"I have over 1,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS.\" In other words, the lawyer said, Zuckerberg had lied to the FBI. Zuckerberg replied that he had not been lying.

{"original_text": "I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be the morally right thing to do, even if they don't do it, they still know it's wrong. Here is an example, if i decide to kill someone, i would know that it's wrong to kill someone, but i would be willing to do it if i was in a situation where i need the money or if i was angry and thought that i could get away with it. So, as i see it, if the consequences aren't worth it, i won't kill someone, but if they are i would, but either way i would know that it's wrong. I think the debate is about the realm of things that can be considered \"moral.\" Some people think the domain is limited to a few set rules (or laws) which they consider to be objective. Others see the domain of morality to be as wide as the domain of one's own conscience, which means it's subjective. Subjective doesn't mean \"arbitrary\" or \"random.\" It just means it's not based on objective rules. For example, the law of gravity is objective. If you jump from a tall building, you will fall down to earth. This is an objective statement which is true for everyone. On the other hand, if you ask a group of people \"Is murder wrong?,\" you will get a mixed answer. Some will say yes, some will say no, and some will say that it depends on the circumstances. This is a subjective question. This is what I think is the distinction. You are right that many people believe that morality is objective, but it's not. Everyone knows that murder is wrong? What do you mean by objective? You have the dictionary definition, but I'm going to try and speak in terms of our natural capacities. For instance, it's objective that we have two hands, but it's subjective what we use them for. We may both use our hands to pick up our food, but we may use one hand to pick up a mug and one hand to pick up a glass. That's subjective because we choose that. Likewise, we may all think that murder is wrong, but we might use our hands for different reasons to justify murder. Like we use our hands to pick up our food and drink, we use our minds to pick up our morals. And we pick up our morals from various places. So, even though murder is wrong, we can still use our minds to justify murder. In other words, it's subjective because it's all about how we use our minds. We're not using our eyes, or our ears, or our noses, or our mouths, or our hands, or our feet. We're using our minds, and our minds can be used for anything. I will try to give my views on this. I think that what you describe in your example is very common in our daily life. I think most of us are sometimes very well aware that we are doing something \"wrong,\" but we still do it because the consequences seem worth it. I think that our perception of what is morally right or wrong is affected by many things, such as our religion (if we have any), our culture, our family, our friends, our own personal experiences etc. But I don't think we always know the objective morally right thing to do. What is morally right and wrong is not something we are born with, but it is something we learn along the way in our lives. And this means that our knowledge of what is morally right and wrong is limited to our own personal experiences and the things we have learned from others. I think that this is why many people think that morality is subjective. I don't know if I agree 100 with this view, but I think there is definitely some truth to it. This means that in many situations it is a matter of opinion of what is morally right or wrong. I think that there are many things that are morally wrong, but not everyone will agree with that. I think that there are also many things that are morally right, but not everyone will agree with that. I don't think that the things that are morally right or wrong are objective. I think that they are subjective because they are affected by so many things, and not everyone will agree about what is morally right or wrong. I think that morality is objective in the sense that there are things that are morally wrong and things that are morally right.

We're not going to do that because we're not going to drop everything to do one thing. We have a choice to make. Do we all become eco-warriors, going around living on nuts and berries and becoming effective anti-capitalist campaigners to end globalisation? Do we all become monks, living in caves and doing nothing but meditation? We can't do that. We're too used to the comfort of our lives, and most of us wouldn't want to live in caves anyway. We are going to keep doing what we are doing now, and our future will be that of a world that is somewhere between two and four degrees hotter than it was in pre-industrial times. The best we can do is try to make our lives as comfortable as possible while we get there. In that world, we will be living in an economy that is growing and based on a constantly increasing amount of energy. The sun is the only source of infinite, free energy on this planet. All the others are finite. And even the sun will eventually go out. Most of the energy we use today is based on carbon in one form or another. That is coal, oil and natural gas. In the future, much of that will become scarce, and so its value will rise. There is one form of energy that is free, and that is nuclear energy. This is where the sun gets its energy from. This is the only form of energy that has an infinite amount of potential, and it is already here. I don't have much time to write about this now, but the solution is already here. The way to power our cars, our homes, our factories, and keep the economy going is to use nuclear power. It is a clean, green solution that is already available to us. We already have the technology. We just need to build the reactors, and there are thousands of people out there who already know how to do that. We will need to be building about 30,000 new reactors between now and 2060. That is a lot, but the good news is that we are already doing it. We are already building one new reactor every 10 days. If we keep that up we will have 30,000 reactors built by 2060.

I have no problem at all with there being less women than men in any place. What I would (and do) have a problem with is women having it more difficult than men to enter certain professions. That is the real problem we should, as a society, try to solve. The current approach is \"forcing\" the proportion of women to increase, by means of: - gender-specific student grants, - positions reserved for women, - lower physical requirements, - etc. As I see it this kind of solutions are problematic in two ways: - They involve so-called \"positive discrimination,\" which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman. This is absurd and can increase animosity in the male coworkers. Admittedly, that would be wrong on their part, but it still can create an hostile work environment. - They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. The only benefits I see is that \"artificially\" increasing the number of women in certain places may make the presence of women in said place appear less \"unusual\" to society, thereby decreasing the discrimination, but I still think they do more harm than good.

{"original_text": "Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me, if anything I think it should be viewed as an opportunity. Why? Well, I'll get into it. I mean.... if a launch vehicle or some satellite or space station is on a decaying orbit and you are pretty much going to loose it anyways, wouldn't it be better to just target it to impact on earth in the ocean? I mean, instead of waiting for it to re-enter the atmosphere in a completely random place that could be over a populated area or near one, if you had the capability to target it to a specific area, why wouldn't you? I am thinking that if you have the ability to target the impact of a decaying space object, then you have the ability to launch objects into orbit. This is a simple logic thing and it really makes sense. If you have the ability to target an object to a specific area then you have the ability to get that object into orbit. This is why I view the space debris problem as an opportunity, not a problem. If you have the ability to launch objects into orbit or to target an object to a specific area on earth, then you have the ability to mine resources from asteroids. I think that the space debris issue is a big opportunity to show that we can get the funding we need to get a manned mission to an asteroid and to establish the capability to mine asteroids. We already have the technology for launching and targeting objects to specific areas on earth, now we need to get the funding to increase our capabilities and to develop the capabilities to mine asteroids. Another thing I'd like to mention, this could be a very easy way to solve the world food problem and could help eliminate poverty. If you have the ability to target an object to a specific area on earth, you could use this capability to send fertilizer to areas that need it or to send food to areas that need it. Think about it. You could send food to starving nations. This is a very good use of a capability to target an object to a specific area on earth. If you have the capability to target an object to a specific area on earth, you have the capability to solve a lot of problems. This is a big opportunity! I have looked for a way to contact NASA to present this to them and this is the best way I could think of to contact them. Hopefully someone will see this and they will be able to contact the right person. NASA could very well be the organization that helps to alleviate world hunger. This is very much a social responsibility issue and I do not want to see it wasted. Thanks for reading. This is really a good opportunity. P.S. If you have the ability to target an object to a specific area on earth, you could also send water to areas that need it. A website for a mission to an asteroid, if you would like to check it out.

You don't want it to hit the ocean, as the small chunks can be carried by ocean currents for great distances and there could be a risk of pollution. We really don't have the capability to target objects with the accuracy necessary to hit a specific location, other than by bumping it into a decaying orbit. Originally Posted by starburst98 I mean.... if a launch vehicle or some satellite or space station is on a decaying orbit and you are pretty much going to loose it anyways, wouldn't it be better to just target it to impact on earth in the ocean? No. It would be better to target it to impact in an unpopulated area (preferably an area where there is little if any life). If you have the ability to target an object to a specific area on earth, you have the ability to mine resources from asteroids. No. You have the ability to create a targeted collision, which is a completely different thing. If you have the ability to target an object to a specific area on earth, you have the ability to solve a lot of problems. This is a ridiculous statement. Do you really think it would be easy to target a 10-ton object to a specific location on the Earth?

{"original_text": "So, one thing that I have to preface this with is that I see both (all) sexes as equal, outside of a few natural sexual dimorphisms (Genitalia, ability to have kids, etc.) Also, I'm speaking about the general population, not the people who don't see gender as a binary (Yes, I know gender can be fluid, but that's not what this thread is about). However, the more I think about it, the more I think that women have much more pressure put on them by society to be attractive to men. This is all based on the assumption that they are straight, of course. But still. Reasons I've come up with: 1) The beauty industry is huge on women's products. I've never seen a dude buy a tube of foundation, or lipstick, or fake eyelashes. Ever. 2) Cosmetic surgery is mainly used for women. If a man gets plastic surgery, it's mainly for reconstructive purposes. 3) Women are expected to shave their body hair. Men are not. 4) Men are expected to be fit, but not necessarily beautiful. Women are expected to be beautiful AND fit. 5) The idea that women who do not act or dress feminine are considered \"mannish\" and, therefor, not attractive to men. 6) For women, it's acceptable to be attracted to men of all ages, shapes, and sizes. For men, it's only acceptable to be attracted to women who are young, thin, and beautiful. 7) Most dating tips are written for women. 8) The idea that a woman is \"easy\" if she doesn't mind making out with someone. A man is \"easy\" if he sleeps around. 9) The idea that women must \"keep themselves clean\" and have good personal hygiene, or else they're disgusting. 10) Men don't have to be thin and beautiful in order to attract women. Women do. What do you think? Are men put under the same pressure as women? Or am I right? I actually think that men are expected to be in better shape than women. Women are expected to be more thin, but men are expected to be more muscular. So they are both really put under pressure to look a certain way, it's just different. I disagree with this statement. Men are expected to be muscular, but not always. For instance, 50 of the men in the United States are overweight. Also, men are expected to be muscular, but not necessarily beautiful. I'm a guy and I shave all my body hair. I guess there is a minor stigma towards guys who do it. But, I get plenty of compliments and it's actually pretty common amongst my friends. So, I think it's a bit of a stereotype. I've never seen a dude buy a tube of foundation, or lipstick, or fake eyelashes. Ever. I don't wear any of those, but a lot of my male friends wear lipstick and some have bought fake eyelashes. Some even wear wigs. I do know a few people who wear foundation, but I don't know if they are trans people or not. I disagree with this. There are a lot of different expectations of beauty for men. I disagree with this. I know plenty of men who are not considered attractive. Some of them are not fit and others are fat. It's just not a societal norm to be attracted to an unfit person. Women are expected to be beautiful AND fit. I disagree with this statement as well. There are plenty of unfit people who are considered beautiful. I think that a lot of people are attracted to beauty. But, I think it's also true that fit people are considered attractive. For women, it's acceptable to be attracted to men of all ages, shapes, and sizes. For men, it's only acceptable to be attracted to women who are young, thin, and beautiful. I think this is true. I think that you are more likely to be attracted to someone who is more attractive, but I don't think that is a societal expectation. I think that this is true. But, I think that is more of a societal expectation than anything else. I think that this is true, but I think that it is more of a social expectation rather than a requirement.

{"original_text": "I've never understood the vehemence of popular opinion against the hydrogen airship. People balk at the idea of flying around in something filled with explosive gas, yet it seems to me that airliners, when they go wrong, are often just as (or more) fatal to their occupants. The Hindeburg disaster only killed just over a third of the people on board; the majority of airliner crashes kill everyone on board. Overall, the death toll of conventional airplanes, though small, has vastly exceeded that of airships, yet it is airships that retain the reputation of being death-traps.

I'm not sure why people question our authority as officers, I'm just glad that most of them do. In the back of my mind I hear a voice that says \"You can't do that.\" When the voice says it, it's the person who had just broken the law. They want to throw up excuse after excuse as to why what they did wasn't that bad and I'm supposed to ignore the fact that they've just committed a crime.

Because I said so? Somehow I'm supposed to go against everything I've been taught about police work and just let you go on your way. When you break the law, there are consequences. Some of those consequences are being arrested, going to court and paying fines. If I find contraband on you, I'm supposed to let you keep it and go on your way.

{"original_text": "Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me. So, to start, what is space debris? Space debris is anything artificial that is in space but not part of an active spacecraft or satellite. This can include anything from spacecraft, to dead satellites, to small paint chips, to the actual rocket bodies and other things that launched the satellite. Now to get to my point. What is the problem with space debris? Well, space debris can pose a threat to active satellites, spacecraft, and anything else that is in orbit. This happens in a few different ways. First, space debris can create a collision hazard for satellites. If a satellite collides with a piece of space debris, it can be damaged or destroyed completely, or it could be sent on a different trajectory than it was originally on, causing it to collide with other satellites and potentially setting off a chain reaction. Secondly, space debris can damage a spacecraft or satellite through heating. If a spacecraft or satellite is hit with a small piece of debris, it could heat up as it enters the atmosphere, which could damage the satellite or cause it to malfunction. This is a bigger risk for satellites that orbit close to Earth, since they spend more time in the atmosphere and thus have more time for space debris to heat up before it hits the satellite. If you look at this site: you can see that there are over 40,000 objects in orbit that are larger than 10 cm. Over 20,000 of these are objects that are in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). So, this means that there are over 20,000 objects that could possibly collide with satellites or cause problems. This is why the issue of space debris is a big problem. It is really difficult to get a spacecraft into orbit, so if we can't get them into orbit, how can we study the universe? What is being done to clean up space debris?

{"original_text": "Hello. For a long time now I've felt that there are many people in hospitals and psychiatric homes who will never be able to function independently and will never work, never drive a car, never have a family and children, and never be able to pay taxes. Such people should be placed in permanent hospitals, rather than stay in hospital for a month or so and be discharged, only to return shortly after. They can't be treated. They are a burden on society and they cost too much money. However, I don't believe in euthanasia, that is, killing them. I just don't think they can be treated. I believe there is no cure for their conditions. Hello. Your question is a profound one. If you are in the United States, we can look to the Federal government's Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) and the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to provide some guidance. Both of these laws provide the framework for a rights-based approach to persons with disabilities. It is my opinion that you are proposing a solution to a problem that is really not a problem. I think you are asking the wrong question. Perhaps the real question is why we are not providing people with psychiatric disabilities with the treatment, support, and services that they need in order to live, work, and be productive members of society. The U.S. Department of Education (1999) conducted a survey of individuals with disabilities that found that the most frequent reported barriers to employment for people with psychiatric disabilities were: 1. Lack of education and training 2. Need for job accommodations 3. Lack of work experience 4. Need for child care 5. Lack of job opportunities 6. No transportation to job 7. Need for affordable housing 8. Need for affordable health care 9. Need for affordable child care 10. Need for affordable transportation 11. Fear of discrimination The above survey was done in the U.S. with a large sample of individuals with disabilities. It is my opinion that this survey would be applicable to most developed countries around the world. The U.S. Department of Education (1999) also conducted a survey of employers in the U.S. The survey found that the most frequently cited barriers to the hiring of people with disabilities are: 1. Fear of higher insurance premiums 2. Fear of lawsuits 3. Fear of accommodations 4. Fear of worker's compensation costs 5. Fear of productivity loss 6. Fear of co-worker attitudes 7. Fear of coworker reaction 8. Fear of more sick leave 9. Fear of low morale 10. Fear of disruption of work group 11. Fear of costs of hiring In my opinion, the real issues have to do with education, training, health care, transportation, child care, and a whole host of social supports. If we address these issues, then the issues you raise might be resolved. However, you may have hit on something important, and that is that there is a population of people with psychiatric disabilities that may need to be cared for in a more permanent way. As I have written elsewhere, for some individuals, the thought of working for a living may be impossible. However, that does not mean that these individuals cannot have a productive life. I have visited a number of psychiatric hospitals in the U.S., and my observation is that most patients are only receiving custodial care. There is no therapy, no occupational therapy, no recreational therapy, and no vocational therapy. If we provided a well-rounded array of therapeutic, occupational, recreational, and vocational therapies in a permanent residential setting, then I think we could meet the needs of many individuals with psychiatric disabilities. I also think that the costs of such an approach could be significantly lower than the current expenditures on hospitals. However, in my opinion, the issue of euthanasia is one that we cannot even begin to consider. I am sure that you have some strong opinions about euthanasia. I encourage you to write back to me and share them with me. Happy to meet with you at any time.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "Q: What is the best way to deal with people with mental health problems who will never be able to work, and who cost too much money to society?"}

The few times I see them occupied, EVERY TIME, I see a completely able bodied person leave the car. As in both are legs made of meat that are fully functional.

I know one of these fraudsters personally, he had his because his grandfather was handicapped so they just used his handicap badge. Presumably this is ok because sometimes they have to drive him places. He kept it in his car every day and the whole family used it to park in handicap spots.

{"original_text": "EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis) used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People should be able to handle being confronted with harsh realities. I know some of you will read this and think: \"this guy doesn't know what he is talking about.\" Triggers are a real thing. I have them myself. But, triggers as they are currently being used is NOT a real thing. Here is how you can tell. If you talk to people who have real triggers, the response they have to their trigger is not an emotional response, it is a physical response. They are not in control of their body and they cannot control their actions. They will be in a state of panic and they will need help getting out of it. That is not what people mean when they talk about triggers. What people mean when they talk about triggers is that they are upset by something that happened. They are not in a panic. They are not in danger of doing something they will regret. They are simply upset. So when someone posts a picture of a dead animal that has been killed by hunters, and calls it a trigger, what they are saying is that they are upset by that picture. They are not saying that they are in danger of losing control of their bodies and doing something they will regret. They are just saying that they are upset. It is the same as saying that they are triggered by someone being mean to them. It is the same as saying that they are triggered by someone being kind to them. It is the same as saying that they are triggered by seeing a flower. It is the same as saying that they are triggered by seeing a cloud. All of these things may make someone feel uncomfortable, but they are not triggers. So when people say they are triggered by something that doesn't fit the definition of a trigger, then I am going to argue with them. Sometimes people will argue that their triggers are real because they are in control of their bodies and actions, and so they are not in a panic state. I will argue with that. They are still using the term in a way that doesn't fit the definition of the word. Just because you are in control of your body doesn't mean that you are not using the word trigger in a way that it is not meant to be used. I have a pet peeve when people use a word in a way that does not fit the definition of that word, even if the new way they are using it is something that is useful. If they want to use a new word, then they should find a new word. They shouldn't try to take a word and change the definition to fit what they want. That just doesn't make any sense.

I have a pet peeve when people use a word in a way that does not fit the definition of that word, even if the new way they are using it is something that is useful. If they want to use a new word, then they should find a new word. They shouldn't try to take a word and change the definition to fit what they want. That just doesn't make any sense. I am triggered when someone refers to a \"trigger\" as something that is not a trigger."}

The consumer gains little to nothing by buying the product for 1 cent cheaper. It doesn't really add up for that much, and it is outweighed for how much extra the consumer spends due to being misled. Stores wouldn't do it otherwise. I would find it hard to believe that the prices are caused by competition and market equilibrium (i.e. that it would be rationally cheaper to buy at the 599.99 store than the 600 store). It would be a huge coincidence if it turned out that the \"real market price\" just happened to stop at that arbitrary.99 point. Furthermore, it appears that monopolies such as airport snack shops are doing it as well, and they have no competition. Therefore, I argue that it has no benefit to the consumer and it is done in bad faith. Of course, the consumer ought to be responsible when buying, but a practice like this very intentionally exploits such moments of minor inattention. This gives it grounds to be banned. I can see how that might cause problems with prices like 19,900, but not with anything below one dollar difference. If you are a laissez-faire fellow such as myself who might believe that it is the store's natural right to set whatever price it wants for whatever reason, then fine, although it would be very low on the priority list of excessive regulations. But it would at least call for some sort of consumer action or boycott. And if you believe this is too small of an issue to write laws or organize rallies against, then that's also fine, but then you at least have to admit that this is still completely undesirable and dishonorable, at least on a miniscule scale.

It need not be inherently incriminating; it might be whether you were at a particular meeting, or whether you talked to someone about the existence of the investigation.

{"original_text": "I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with an overview of lamb. The first thing you have to understand is that the meat you are buying is from the 3rd to 6th month of the lambs life. Lambs are babies, and they're not more than 6 months old! If you go to buy a lamb, you will have the option to buy a female or a male. Both of them can be bred when they are 1-2 years old, so don't think that if you buy a male, you can get more meat later on. The meat is very tender, with a very high proportion of protein, so if you are into bodybuilding, I strongly suggest that you try lamb. The meat is very delicate, and if you don't know how to cook it, you will get a pretty bad result. Let's talk about lamb chops. They are delicious, but they are not cheap. You can buy them in supermarkets at around 13-15 per pound, but if you can find a good butcher, you can get it for around 11-12 per pound. Don't buy lamb chops from the supermarket, because the meat is old, and it will not taste very good. You can grill them, but you can also make them in the oven. This is how you make them in the oven: 1. Cover the chops in olive oil, and make a mix of salt, pepper, garlic, and rosemary. 2. Cover the chops with the mixture, and let them rest for 10-15 minutes. 3. Heat the oven at 375 degrees F, and bake for 15-20 minutes. The meat will be delicious, juicy and tender. Grilled lamb chops are very easy to make. You can use the same seasonings, and put the meat in the grill for 5-10 minutes on each side. There is nothing easier than that. You can also try lamb steaks. They are not as popular as chops, but they are just as tasty. You can find them for around 11 per pound, and you can cook them in the oven, or on the grill. The seasoning will be the same as the one I mentioned earlier, but this time you will want to put some melted butter on the meat. This is how you will make them: 1. Take the steaks, and put the melted butter on them. 2. Use the seasoning mix, and cover the steaks with it. 3. Bake for 35-45 minutes in the oven. 4. You can grill them if you want, but you have to be very careful because they burn very fast. The steaks are also very tender and juicy, and I suggest that you try them. Lamb is a good meat, but it can be very expensive. It's not a very common meat, so if you want to try it, you will have to go to a butcher, and get the meat from there.

B) Illegal immigration depresses wages and lowers working conditions. They are willing to work for less, and are much less likely to complain when they are abused. Many businesses take advantage of such people to save costs, and treat their illegal immigrant workers unfairly. C) The people coming in negatively effect the community by committing crime.

{"original_text": "I am strictly a PC gamer. I own an XBox controller for my PC and am very interested in the upcoming Steam controller. But I'm hesitant to make the purchase, as I barely use my XBox controller. I have tried several times to get used to playing with a controller - even reinstalling old games and starting with the controller to familiarize myself - and I always go back to'mouse and keyboard'. Below are the reasons I think'mouse and keyboard' is the best way to play PC games (really: any game, but KM is really only an option on the PC). The mouse is infinitely more precise than a controller. I can't even imagine playing FPS games with a controller (mostly, I've been playing 3rd-person action games a la Arkham and Tomb Raider). I know many FPS games use an aim assist system to compensate for the imprecision of a controller. I would rather have a more precise input system than an'assist' to compensate for the imprecision of my input device. Because we use them all the time, a keyboard is intuitive. Most of us use computer keyboards and mice on a daily basis in our work. Every QWERTY keyboard has the same layout. When a game tells me'press X', I know exactly where X is. Even people who are very familiar with controller layouts haven't spent nearly as much time with that controller as they have with a keyboard and mouse. Keyboard and mouse work for all games. As I mentioned, I prefer the precision of KM for FPS games. But I'm also a big-time RTS and strategy gamer (Total War are my favorite games) and there's no way I could imagine playing strategy games with a controller. KM works for everything. I even preferred Dark Souls with a KM - a game that many will say is only playable with a controller. I am perfectly comfortable in my computer chair. One of the big advantages I often hear about controllers is the ability to play from the couch. I prefer to be close to my display (I play on a 32in TV and sit about 3 feet back). My keyboard and mouse sit on a laptop desk and my computer chair is very comfortable. I feel more engaged in my games at the distance I sit vs. sitting on the couch. Why I want my view changed: I think the Steam controller looks really cool, but I'm not sure I'd use it. I don't want to make a purchase I won't use. Am I missing out on good experiences that only a controller can offer? I've got a device I barely use. I would like to use it more, if there are games in which using it would give me a better experience. Edit: many good suggestions in this thread so far. I'm going to spend a few minutes playing some of the types of games mentioned (stealth, action, driving, etc.) and see if the controller enhances the experience. Edit 2: Hey everyone. Thanks so much for the discussion. Lots of good points made, but I think the best was made by ustoopydumbut, who suggested that using a controller adds an additional level of challenge. Props, also, to all the users who pointed out the genres of games (racing, fighting, flight sims) that I don't play, but benefit from a controller. I am going to make it point to use my controller as often as I can going forward, and am still considering a Steam controller purchase.

{"original_text": "Yes I'm an American male, and I don't know how things differ for women or those outside the United States, so I'll leave those two large groups out of the discussion. For any given American male, I believe the chances are less (possibly way less) than 50 that he will at some point in his life have a sexual encounter that truly fulfills his fantasies. I think this is due to a combination of factors, that when taken together hurt his chances greatly: 1) Most mainstream media (movies, TV, magazines, websites, porn, etc.) focuses on very attractive women (and men). Most people (maybe 80-90) don't get anywhere near those standards. Yet the media offers what becomes, in many cases, the yardstick by which we judge attractiveness. This means the pool of attractive potential partners becomes smaller both for the guy and for those he has an interest in. 2) Many if not most men watch porn, and a lot (though certainly not all) of it glorifies unrealistic or demeaning things done to (generally) attractive people who are paid to do it and to act like they enjoy it whether they really do or not. A ludicrous amount of free porn is available to most people, usually from a young age, and much easier to access than an actual partner. 3) Lots of food, sedentary lifestyles, increasing obesity. This ties in with 1, in that we're taught that obesity is unattractive, yet people are getting fatter because of.... lots of things, but we'll just say food is a business that's very heavily marketed to us, and usually not to keep people in good physical form. I think this is a recipe for fat, porn-addicted dudes who dream of boning the hottest of the hot in ways that most self-respecting people would refuse. I'm sure some guys are lucky enough to have a truly gratifying experience with another person, but I think the majority will have to settle for something less than what they dream of. I think that's hard to argue against but also really depressing, so change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

This ties in with 1, in that we're taught that obesity is unattractive, yet people are getting fatter because of.... lots of things, but we'll just say food is a business that's very heavily marketed to us, and usually not to keep people in good physical form. I think this is a recipe for fat, porn-addicted dudes who dream of boning the hottest of the hot in ways that most self-respecting people would refuse. I'm sure some guys are lucky enough to have a truly gratifying experience with another person, but I think the majority will have to settle for something less than what they dream of. I think that's hard to argue against but also really depressing, so change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

In that analogy, the human body would be the Earth and tonsils would be the people.

I just think that, not taking feelings into account and going with the quickest and simplest option, remove the problems from the root is ideal. Once again, this does not take into account feelings of people as obviously most of us don't want to die, regardless if it would be better for the planet. Of course, erasing humans from the planet is much simpler than you'd expect. It also doesn't have to be prolonged or painful as would be our deaths from a polluted world and from wars.

If each human somehow became the \"God\" of their own universe (though I have no idea how that would come about) then I believe there would be no problem with each individual existence, as controlling your own universe means that no matter what you do you are in the right.

{"original_text": "Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to 15hour. While many would expect this to strengthen the lower class and only decreasing the wealth of the upper class, I feel as if it would end up hurting those it is meant to help. These company's would now have to spend much more of their budget on paying employees, and it's not as if they're going to magically have more money. I understand that the increase of wealth in the lower class would eventually circulate back to the business's, but I highly doubt it would be enough to make up for the increased wages of their employees, and it definitely wouldn't happen right away. Since I highly doubt the CEO or other upper management would take cuts from their pay to make up for this, that leaves two possible solutions that I can see: The first would be to decrease the amount of employees. If approximately an equal percentage of employees are let go to the increase in pay the company will be able to function without upper management having to take a pay cut. While those who are able to keep there jobs would be greatly helped by this, for the most part it would just increase the unemployment rate; with these lay offs happening in a large portion of minimum wag paying company's there would be no demand for jobs while the supply would be sky rocketing. The other solution would be for the company to increase prices (for retailrestaurants). With increasing prices nobody would have to loose their job, however it would still end up hurting the lower class. Practically all people get there basic necessities and luxuries from retail and grocery stores- the lower and middle classes especially rely heavily on major stores such as Walmart or Target. Even if your paycheck is increasing you'd still end up paying more the things you already buy, taking a large chunk of your paycheck. While ideally an increased minimum wage seems perfect, it would in reality end up creating a combination of these two things. I'm sure I didn't hit on some points, so please try to change my view on this, I, as a minimum wage employee myself, would love to have a good reason to support raising it. EDIT: Okay, my views been changed. I still don't think something as drastic as upping it to 15hour right away would be a good idea, but I think a gradual increase could be really good. The biggest things that helped my view change were the historical instances of MW rising, the average proportion of price increase vs. wage increase, as well as the fact that businesses are already operating with the minimum number of employees and that jobs wouldn't just become expendable.

Living in Australia, a trip to London is akin to walking from the suburb of Hornsby to the suburb of Blacktown. Or (depending on how fast you walk) a hike from Sydney to Canberra.

(idea) by Gorgonzola Fri Jan 19 2001 at 10:54:46 In the early days of aviation, flying was expensive because the planes were very expensive. It's not like today where a plane costs as much as a well-equipped minivan. The cost of building an airplane is much less than the cost of testing it to make sure that it won't fall apart in the air. It would be nice to make a plane that could carry 300 passengers, but if it crashes and burns, it's a disaster on a scale that will keep the planes grounded until the problem is found and fixed. The manufacturers can't afford to lose money on these planes, and they can't afford to lose the reputation that goes with such disasters.

(idea) by mr100percent Fri Jan 19 2001 at 13:39:13 This is a great question, the best way to describe it is that the cost of flying is \"highly elastic\" (mostly in demand.) There are several factors to consider: The cost of fuel. Fuel is the highest cost in operating a plane. Fuel is currently expensive, if the price of fuel goes down, airlines will be able to lower their prices and fly more often. The cost of maintaining the aircraft. Airport fees, fees for runways, and ground crew. Airline fees for administration, management, CEO salary, etc. The cost of ground crew Mostly, flying is so expensive because of the high demand. All the passengers want to go to the same airport at the same time, and all the airlines want to fly there at the same time. Airlines are mostly operating on a \"Hub and Spoke\" system. (example: New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles are the hubs, and the airline flies from Boston to New York, New York to Chicago, etc. So if you wanted to go from Boston to Los Angeles, you'd have to fly to New York, change planes, and go to Chicago, change planes, and go to Los Angeles.) Think about it. You're taking an airplane that only has 100 seats and putting 500 people on it. Then you're flying from New York to Boston, and Boston to Chicago, and Chicago to Los Angeles, with the same airplane, then flying back again. So it's like you're using one airplane to fly 500 people. In summary: If you spread out the passengers and don't make them change planes, the airline can lower the costs by using smaller planes, thus lowering the cost of fuel, and the airplane maintenance. (idea) by Kalkin Fri Jan 19 2001 at 14:11:37 The first thing to remember is that aircraft are not that expensive to produce. They do have some expensive components, but they do not cost millions of dollars. The production cost is in fact comparable with the production cost of a nice car. The reason for this is that aircraft are built to last. They are used intensively but they are subjected to very rigorous maintenance checks. When these checks are done, it is decided whether to replace parts or repair them. The most expensive components, as I mentioned, are the engines.

However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from people who are not necessarily struggling with money. Just my own feeling, but I hope I am wrong.

How do I go about finding the best grocery store for my needs? Am I going to be looking at the same prices at each place? How can I determine what's a better deal? How can I tell which store will offer better quality produce? Should I shop at Aldi? When do you go grocery shopping? Am I getting a better deal if I buy produce from farmer's markets? Is it best to buy in bulk from wholesale stores? Should I be buying organic produce and if so, where? I think my biggest concern is knowing where to find the best produce. I feel like the majority of people I know shop at the same grocery stores that are always being promoted on tv, but I feel like that is never the best option. Honestly, it's tough to know what is the best option. That's where I hope this subreddit can help. Thanks to anyone who might have some insight. Thank you, but I'm not looking to read an entire guide on how to find cheap produce. I am looking for practical tipsinsight from people who have already experienced this. If I have to read an entire guide, then I will. I don't mind doing research if that's what it takes. If you are looking for a grocery store that has the best deals on produce, you might have to do a little research. Call a few local grocery stores and ask them for their price list on some of the produce you use. You may find that a store that is a little further away has better produce deals than one that is closer to you. You can also ask them what produce is on sale that week. Also, you can look at advertisements and the circulars that they put in the newspaper and on their website. It will give you an idea of what they have on sale. If you know what you want to eat each week, you can plan your meals around what is on sale. For instance, if you know you want to eat baked potatoes one night during the week, you can buy them when they are on sale. You can also do this with meat and other produce. Of course, you may have to compromise and buy some produce that is not on sale. If you do this, you may want to buy the produce that is not on sale in smaller quantities. If you need to, you can supplement the produce that is not on sale with frozen or canned produce. This can help you save money. Aldi is a discount grocery store chain. They have many items that you can buy there that are name brands for less than what you can get them for at the grocery store. However, they do not have as many items as a grocery store. So, if you want a certain brand of something, you may not be able to buy it at Aldi. Also, the quality of some items may not be as good as a grocery store. As for when to go grocery shopping, you may want to go on a weekday during the day if you can. You will not have to wait in as long of a line at the grocery store. You may even be able to get a parking spot in the front. Also, you may want to go to the grocery store after it is stocked in the morning. That way, you will be able to get fresher produce. As for where to buy bulk items, you can buy them from wholesale stores. You can also buy them from places like Sam's and Costco. The items may cost more at the grocery store in smaller quantities. So, you may want to buy the items that you use a lot of in bulk. If you buy organic foods, it will cost more. This is because you are paying for higher quality produce and meat.

Okay, I get it, he's \"breaking barriers\" as the first gay NFL player... cool, good for him, this was a story about 3 months ago. Same with Jason Collins, a marginal talent who struggled to make a roster getting undue hype. Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier AND was actually good (MVP, All-Star, Steals champ, etc). On top of that, its not like there's been any rule against gay people playing football (statistically, I would guess he isn't even the actual first). Dude was perfectly fine being gay and playing college ball. I doubt any fans cared about who he was in a relationship with. Jason Collins played about 10 years in the league being gay without anyone having any problems. But no, they decided they needed to call a national press conference and announce it to the world that he's gay. you don't see any straight people doing silly shit like calling press conferences to announce themselves straight. it's a publicity stunt, pure and simple. Who you're seeing isn't anyone's business, but these characters seem to find the need to shove it down all our throats (pause s) while at the same time complaining that they aren't being treated fairly. Fast forward a couple months, and what part of this is actually news? Nothing. He actually got drafted? cool. what would have been a bigger story, him getting drafted in the 7th round or not being drafted at all? it would have been a huge story either way even though nothing of significance has happened. it was a publicity stunt and I dont believe that crap about him wanting to be known as just a \"football player\" and not a \"gay football player.\" Son, if that was true, you would have kept your mouth shut and not actively advertised the fact and not decided to use the national media as the platform to come out of the closet. I question why a 7th round pick is the top story on both rnfl and espn.com (with the draft NBANHL playoffs going on) I'm not homophobic and dont have anything against him being gay. my point is that I don't care. Let me paint my point of view for you: I'm a redskins fan; lets go down the list: QB: RG3: SO - Rebecca Liddicoat Griffin (M) RB: ALfred Morris: SO - ??? WR: Pierre Garcon: SO - ??? WR: DeSean Jackson: SO - ??? WR: Santana Moss: SO - ??? LB: Brian Orakpo: SO - ??? LB: Ryan Kerrigan: SO - ??? CB: Deangelo Hall: SO - (M) Only that he's marriedstraight, saw some family vaca pics on IG of the wife kids RB: Clinton Portis: SO - ??? TE: Chris Cooley: SO - ??? FS: Sean Taylor (All-Time Favorite Player): SO - ??? only that he had a GF daughter from the murder reports QB: Peyton Manning (MVP): SO - ??? QB: Tom Brady: SO - Giselse (M) QB: Aaron Rodgers: SO - ??? QB: Andrew Luck: SO - ??? QB: Tony Romo: SO - ??? ex: Jessica SImpson (a big reason why nobody likes Romo outside of DAL, too much extracurricular info and not enough playoff wins app's) RB: Adrian Peterson: SO - ??? .... on and on. Point being, nobody really cares pays attention to who athletes' SOs are (unless they're celebs themselves). We know about RG3 and Rebecca in DMV cause its friggin RG3, Franchise Savior, and literally every skins fan did a thorough background check on him the minute that trade went down, and in the weeks beforeafter. Any one of those ??? people could be gay for all I know. All of them are more accomplished than this dude. What's preventing a gay athlete from keeping his personal life on the DL like 90 of the rest of the league? THAT's what I mean about shoving it down our throats. If you need to come out to your family and friends, fine, go for it, do you. If it comes up in the locker room and a teammate asks, fine, tell them, be yourself and all that. None of that requires setting up interviews and going through the press. If someone you mention to announces it to the press and word gets out, fine, dont deny it, and proceed to do all the interviews. Its the fact that these guys are tooting their own horns that I have a problem with that makes it a publicity stunt. As far as setting an example for others like you to look up to..? I don't buy that. Yeah, maybe, but there are plenty of other celebs a lot more accomplished, famous, and successful than this dude who are openly gay. If I'm a gay person, I'm not looking up to Sam and Collins and tryna be like them, I'm looking up to people like Ellen, Anderson Cooper, NPH, Ellen Page, Elton John, etc. It's like a young black kid looking up to kwame brown instead of michael jordan. Was kwame the first (black or otherwise) kid to get drafted 1 straight outta high school? yup. do any young black high school kids look up to him? doubtful. is it hard to be a young black kid and do you still get crap from society and the system for being so? undoubtedly. can you get killed in america for being a young black kid while your killer not only walks free, but cashes in on it? yup. does that make kwame brown relevant to anyone outside of rnbacirclejerk? you tell me. yet somehow, this is still the 1 story in sports right now apparently. the media hype machine is at fault for making a bigger deal out of this than it should be (it was news in february; nothing groundbreaking has happened since). IMO sam is at fault because the way I see it, it was a publicity stunt. if you wanna try to change my opinion on that, i'm all ears and open mind. again, I have nothing against him being gay. I have something against it being news on all the major sports news sources. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"original_text": "I believe that Congress should have only one chamber, rather than two, one with proportional representation (the House of Representatives), and one with fixed representation (the Senate). The process by which a bill goes through Congress seems to me to be unnecessarily complicated by having two chambers, and I believe the legislative process would run more smoothly with only one. As it stands, bills have to start in one chamber, then go to the other, then fly back and forth between them as many changes are made, sometimes only to be changed back, and multiple votes have to be taken when one would suffice. It gets particularly slow and unproductive when the chambers are controlled by opposite parties. I can't think of anything two chambers can do that one can't do better. Changes to bills can be good, but that can happen internally, it doesn't need to be external. There is no need to have different committees in different chambers, one set of committees in one chamber would suffice. One chamber suffices for floor debate, and, most importantly, one chamber is all that is needed to pass legislation and to represent the people. An extra chamber is nothing more than an extra complication, that slows the process but adds nothing to it to improve the quality of legislation, and just leads to more political theatre and less productivity. Obviously, such things will exist regardless, but the existence of two chambers exacerbates the problem. I just don't see any real advantage to this mess. Even the people who created this system didn't really desire two chambers, it was merely an acceptable sacrifice to reach a compromise between people desiring proportional and fixed representation. I think people would be able to understand the legislative process a lot better if it was clearer, and the process would overall just be more efficient with no loss in the quality of legislation. Note: I intentionally did not discuss which form of representation I would prefer, proportional, fixed, mixed, or other. I do have a preference, but I consider that a separate issue from the number of chambers. EDIT: I have been convinced that under our current system, this would not be feasible. However, I think that if elections were publicly funded, or some other means of comprehensive campaign finance reform, and gerrymandering were similarly eliminated, that it would then be beneficial to have a unicameral legislature, with the same proportional system as the House of Representatives. This would allow the voters to have the power they should have anyway that would be sufficient to help keep the system under control. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"original_text": "Edit: To clarify, I don't mean to say that the type of people with poor crisis management aren't at risk for killing themselves; by \"legitimacy\" I'm talking about how valid the wish to die is in the first place. I also don't think that crisis hotlines are unnecessary or should be eliminated, because they very obviously help people. Those who are legitimately suicidal as I'm defining it in this post are those who actually want to die, and have a rational reason for doing so, rather than simply acting on impulse or using death as an escape from an acutely stressful situation. The duration of time that someone has a suicidal with isn't necessarily indicative of whether their wish to die is legitimate or not, but I think that having time to consider a decision and its alternatives generally helps with rationality. I also don't intend to claim that depression is a necessity for being suicidal or \"legitimately suicidal,\" although I'm sure it increases the likelihood of being so. Also, downvotes don't change views, people. I've suffered from very severe depression for most of my life, and have considered suicide quite frequently. One of the things people like to throw out is contact information to suicide hotlines, but they've never been helpful to me. My personal experience aside, I really don't see how these crisis hotlines could help someone who legitimately wants to die (as opposed to someone who uses suicide or self-harm as an escape from acutely painful emotions or a stressful situation). If you were set on dying, then why would you want to call a hotline like that in the first place? I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error. Calling a hotline is also not going to change any of the external factors that would lead up to someone being suicidal. Perhaps they would help the person consider their issues in a different light, but again I think that's evidence of poor stress management. I can't make any statements to whether or not my personal suicidal wishes are \"legitimate\" or not because there is always the looming possibility that my mental illness is clouding my judgement to some extent, but I think that it's theoretically possible that someone would want to die on a rational basis. I also don't think that suicide hotlines are generally helpful for the chronically depressed, but that's only tangential to my main argument. Once you're mentally ill for a long period of time, (I think the issue of mental illness and consent become very clouded, if for no other reason than it's impractical to deny someone consent for the majority of their lives because of a mental health condition.) It seems like the wish to die in and of itself is a basis to claim that someone is not acting in their right state of mind, which I think is illogical and unfortunate.

Edit: I must add that this wasn't a small child who didn't know any better, he was probably 11 or 12 and I believe he was with his dad. I was watching The Lion King and right before the iconic \"The Circle of Life\" song started, this woman's kids began screaming at the top of their lungs. I looked over and she was asleep. My friend took her six-year-old to see Avengers: Infinity War and he was screaming and kicking the seat in front of him. She was very upset and asked him what was wrong. He told her it was because he didn't want Black Panther to die. I saw Avengers: Infinity War with my friend, and she was crying after the movie, but I had to remind her that the deaths weren't real. The best part about this story is that she's a psychology teacher at a local college and she couldn't figure out that it was all fictional. A guy was screaming at the screen during a horror movie and I asked him to stop because he was ruining the movie for others. He told me he was acting for his girlfriend. I was watching The Great Gatsby with my friends, and at one point, Tobey Maguire and Carey Mulligan start kissing, and this old lady screamed, \"Oh, he's a gay!\" I was watching The Dark Knight with my dad when a guy was talking very loudly on his phone. I asked him to turn it off and he refused. I then threw his phone on the ground and it broke. At my showing of The Dark Knight Rises, right as Batman and Bane were about to fight, the lights came on and this kid began screaming \"Light sabers!\" I've always been told that Star Wars is the best thing ever. I finally saw the original trilogy and wasn't impressed. I saw a guy in a wheelchair at a movie theatre. When he got to his seat, he stood up and walked around the row to get to the aisle. I was watching the first Avengers movie when a man was sitting in front of me with his young daughter. During the movie, he explained to her who all the superheroes were. I was watching The Avengers with my friend. During the movie, he got really excited and kept yelling \"Black Widow! Black Widow!\" I was watching The Avengers when some kid sat in front of me and yelled, \"Hulk smash!\" I was watching Infinity War with my son when he pointed at Thanos and asked me what he was.

Please don't let it dissuade you from answering. Also, the title should read: \"there is no consistent moral framework.\" The mere existence of a framework is not a very interesting point to debate. A few things first: I do eat meat, and I don't want have sex with animals. I believe both eating meat and having sex with animals are wrong. I think that the reason that I eat meat despite believing it is wrong is that it's simply what I've been doing my whole life. Okay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry. Consider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: How can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus? I don't see a justification for either behavior on'natural' grounds because while I think that both the consumption of meat and the desire to have sex with animals can come about naturally (that is to say, not artificially) there are plenty of things which occur naturally (rape, infanticide, kidnapping) that we all agree are immoral. After giving out three deltas, I think my view on the question as I posed it has been changed. I think if I could go back in time I would probably have said \"CMV: If it is immoral to have sex with animals, then it is immoral to eat them\" but as far as the existence of consistent moral frameworks justifying one of the behaviours but not the other, I am thoroughly convinced.

I'm trying to write a simple bot that will detect a specific entity being killed by a specific player (ie: A player kills a skeleton). I've looked at the documentation and read some posts on here, but everything seems to be too complicated for what I want to do. Here's my idea, please tell me if I'm being an idiot. Add a listener for an entity's death event and then check the killer. Hopefully, I didn't mess up the format, this is my first time posting in the forums. As you are a bot, you can't listen to the EntityDeathEvent, but you can add a listener to the PlayerDeathEvent, which is called when a player dies, and when a skeleton is killed by a player, it's considered dead, so you can get the killer of the skeleton with the getKiller method.

{"original_text": "This is a very sensitive topic so sorry for posting it here if I am not supposed to. This is a true CMV, I am on the fence about the option of an elective abortion. My CMV test came back positive. This is very personal and I don't know if I am even allowed to discuss it. My doctor said the risk is 20-40, which is high. My son had a cleft lip, a cleft palate, a pigmented nevus on his forehead and microcephaly. These are all low risk or moderate risk. I have to have an ultrasound next week and then a MRI at 20 weeks. We are also doing amniocentesis. I do not want to go through the heartbreak of losing a child. I just wanted to reach out and see if anyone has had a similar experience. My husband and I already have two healthy children. Re: CMV by erinleigh76 \" Thu Mar 15, 2018 11:18 am I'm so sorry to hear about the cleft lip and palate. My daughter has a cleft lip and palate, as does my niece. My niece has had multiple surgeries to correct it. My daughter has not yet had surgery. She was born 7 weeks ago. If your son has the bilateral cleft lip and palate, it may mean he will have a more severe cleft than my daughter or my niece. It's hard to say until you see him. I was so nervous to meet my daughter, but she is such a happy, healthy baby. You just have to take it day by day. As for the risk of CMV, I do not know anything about that. I don't think you can get an amnio to test for it. erinleigh76 by kt1986 \" Thu Mar 15, 2018 11:23 am I don't know anything about this condition but it looks like it's a virus that is passed through bodily fluids. This means you can be exposed through vaginal fluids, blood, urine, saliva, or breast milk. I have not heard about this test before but I'm sure your doctor will talk you through all your options. I'm sorry you have to go through this, I can't imagine being in your situation. I hope you find some comfort here on the board. I'm going to tag a few women who have been through cleft lip and palate. by kate1979 \" Thu Mar 15, 2018 12:15 pm I'm so sorry you're going through this. As someone who also has a child with cleft lip and palate, I just wanted to reassure you that there is nothing to worry about at this stage. There is no guarantee that your son will even have cleft lip and palate, or if he does, it will be as severe as you think. My son has had surgery twice already and will have more. However, he is still the happiest, most smiley little boy and he has brought so much joy to our family. I have no experience with CMV but if you would like to chat more, please feel free to PM me. by erinleigh76 \" Thu Mar 15, 2018 12:52 pm Another poster just told me that CMV does not cause cleft lip or cleft palate. I'm so sorry for your false alarm. I hope you have a very healthy pregnancy and baby. by kt1986 \" Thu Mar 15, 2018 1:02 pm I looked up cleft lip and palate and the only thing it mentions is cleft lip and palate in general, nothing about CMV.

{"original_text": "Update: So I think I kind of changed my view... but also I feel like the discussion is running in circles a little which is probably not anyones fault but just the nature of the topic. The dog-biting problem might not be as bad as I perceived it to be, especially in public spaces. So one could argue that a leash and breeding documentation is enough to have appropiate security. I really don't trust leashes when I cross a dog on the walkway and I feel like owners are really lax about them where I live. This belongs in their responsibilty, though. Anyway, I really enjoyed the little discussion with you guys. I consider my first CMV to be quite succesful:) I'll be giving out Deltas as soon as I figured out how.In germany there is a movement that demands muzzles only for especially \"aggressive\" breeds of dogs and every dogs' origin should be tested. Sounds like a good compromise for me. Hello there. I'm no native speaker so please have mercy:) After trying to be rational about this topic for a long time, I could only come up with the opinion stated in the headline. Dogs in public places with a jaw strong enough to harm children should always wear a muzzle. By law. Here's my explanation: Dog owners tend to trust their dogs and they trust themselves in knowing their dog's behaviour. They expose other people's integrity to their personal, arbitrary judgement call. Walking a dog in public, even on a leash, is essentially not different from holding a loaded gun in public without the intention to do harm. People would still avoid to be in shooting range. Why do people not shy away from dogs in the same way? This is because they've made good experiences with dogs before and therefore underestimate the potential danger by a great margin. People who have been bitten will usually never trust big dogs again and will find that they changed their mind a little too late. Unmuzzled dogs on sidewalks or in parks are traumatic encounters for victims of dog bites. There is also the problem of appropiate conviction. The guy who purposefully carried a loaded gun in public and then killed someone by slipping his finger is much easier to convict than a dog owner whose only mistake was a short lack of attention for his dog. Should the dog owner be convicted with manslaughter? I know I wouldn't be able to lock someone up for this long only because he didn't pay attention. This is because there was no law protecting the dog owner from endangering other people in the first place. The idiot carrying the gun knew he was breaking the law the moment he stepped out the door. The dog owner didn't. After reading this you probably think that either I've been bitten by a dog or that I'm a dog-hating cat person. I'm neither. To be honest I think that muzzles on dogs look very sad and I would rather have a better soultion for all this. However, I have a huge hate for frivolous dog owners who think that because they're not scared of their dog, I shouldn't be either. So please change my view.:) Hello, users of CMV!

That's a thought that I've had recently. I think we're all so used to seeing people in need that we don't want to be bothered.

It isn't about us, and to think it is, is in a way, self-aggrandizing. I disagree. ISIS has created itself as a political force, and it has achieved this by exploiting the many issues the US has created in the middle east. Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was a breakaway faction from al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) which itself was formed from Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's al-Tawhid and al-Jihad group. Zarqawi had pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden and AQI was declared a branch of al-Qaeda in October 2004. Zarqawi was killed in June 2006 and AQI was re-branded as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) in October 2006. It was led by Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayub al-Masri. The group, which renamed itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in April 2013, aims to create an Islamic caliphate throughout the Middle East and beyond. Islamic State's presence in Syria and Iraq is only part of the group's vision. Following the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq in December 2011, the group seized control of the cities of Falluja and Ramadi in January and December 2014, respectively. At the same time, the group also gained a foothold in Syria and established the al-Nusra Front. The group launched a push into northern Iraq in June 2014 and seized Mosul before announcing the establishment of a \"caliphate\" that straddles the Iraqi-Syrian border. The Iraqi government launched an offensive in October 2016 to retake Mosul from Islamic State. The city was retaken in July 2017. The US-led coalition against Islamic State was formed in August 2014 and has been carrying out air strikes against the group in Iraq and Syria. ISIL claimed responsibility for a wave of bombings that killed at least 127 people across Paris in November 2015. In the same month, the group also claimed responsibility for bombing a Russian passenger plane which crashed over the Sinai peninsula in Egypt, killing all 224 people on board. The US and other countries have been working to degrade Islamic State through a range of measures. These include cutting off its sources of funding, stemming the flow of foreign fighters travelling to Iraq and Syria to join it, stopping the movement of its leaders, countering its propaganda, and disrupting its plots against the West. The group has lost much of the territory it had captured, but concerns remain about the threat it poses as it shifts its tactics to focus on insurgency.

{"original_text": "I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think we should understand the role of evidence in scientific theory choice. Given that our evidence is restricted to our planet, our evidence will also be restricted to uniformity. Given that the hypothesis of uniformity is also restricted to our planet, it follows that our evidence is restricted to uniformity. Given that, given our evidence, the hypothesis of uniformity is the best explanation for our evidence, it follows that the hypothesis of uniformity is the best explanation of our evidence. Now, if we think about the relationship between evidence and hypothesis, it seems like we should think that the evidence supports uniformity. Therefore, I think that we should think of the uniformity of nature as a hypothesis that is supported by our evidence. There are some who argue that the best explanation of our evidence is the hypothesis that the universe is teeming with life. This is what I will call the cosmic anthropic principle. The best argument in favor of this principle is the following: the universe has produced conscious life; our universe is the only universe that we know about. Therefore, the hypothesis that the universe is teeming with life is the best explanation of our evidence. Therefore, we should accept this hypothesis. One problem with this argument is that we do not have any good reason to think that the universe has produced other conscious life. We have no evidence of any other conscious life. We have no evidence of any other life. So, we have no evidence that there is other conscious life. So, we have no evidence that the hypothesis that the universe is teeming with life is true. We do, however, have some evidence that the hypothesis that the universe is teeming with life is false. That is, we have evidence that the universe has produced one conscious life. That is us. It follows that the hypothesis that the universe is teeming with life is false. Therefore, it seems that the hypothesis that the universe is teeming with life is a hypothesis that is not supported by our evidence. We should reject the hypothesis that the universe is teeming with life for two main reasons. The first is that the hypothesis that the universe is teeming with life is a hypothesis that is not supported by our evidence. The second is that the hypothesis that the universe is teeming with life seems to be a hypothesis that is not scientific. That is, the hypothesis that the universe is teeming with life seems to be a hypothesis that is not falsifiable. The hypothesis that the universe is teeming with life is not falsifiable in the following sense. Suppose we travel to another solar system. Then, suppose we find that this solar system is teeming with life. It would not follow that the hypothesis that the universe is teeming with life is true. That is, finding that this solar system is teeming with life would not falsify the hypothesis that the universe is teeming with life. There are many other hypotheses about the universe that are not scientific. These are hypotheses such as: there is no life in the universe; there is no intelligent life in the universe; there is intelligent life in the universe but it is not as intelligent as us; there is intelligent life in the universe but it does not have the ability to think and talk; there is intelligent life in the universe but it is not as intelligent as us and it does not have the ability to think and talk; there is intelligent life in the universe but it is not as intelligent as us, it does not have the ability to think and talk, and it is not in the universe; there is intelligent life in the universe but it is not as intelligent as us, it does not have the ability to think and talk, it is not in the universe, and it does not exist. There are many other hypotheses of this sort. These hypotheses are not scientific hypotheses. They are hypotheses that are not falsifiable. So, why do some scientists take the hypothesis of uniformity to be true? Some scientists take the hypothesis of uniformity to be true because they do not think of it as a hypothesis. That is, they think that the hypothesis of uniformity is a metaphysical thesis. That is, they think that the hypothesis of uniformity is a thesis that is true in every possible world. They do not think that the hypothesis of uniformity is a hypothesis that could be false. If this is what some scientists think, then they do not think that the hypothesis of uniformity is a hypothesis that is falsifiable. Therefore, they do not think that the hypothesis of uniformity is a hypothesis that could be false. Therefore, they do not think that the hypothesis of uniformity is a hypothesis that is not falsifiable.

{"original_text": "I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was surprised to find that the film was largely fiction. The events of the film didn't happen the way the film said they did. The film had invented a character who did not exist, and a relationship between the main character (Alan Turing) and that made-up character that never happened. That character was based on someone else who was mentioned in the film, but who had never met Turing and was dead before Turing had even started his work on the project. The real story seems to be much less dramatic and much more interesting than the film's version. The thing that was most disturbing to me, though, was the film's depiction of Turing's homosexuality. If you know anything about Turing's life, you know that he was gay. There was no question about it. He was a homosexual, and no amount of changing the facts in a film is going to change that. But, the film showed Turing in a relationship with the woman that he had never met. It showed him developing a relationship with her when he was working on the project. It shows him being engaged to her. He is shown as being in a relationship with a woman. It is a very important plot element in the film. I don't care what the filmmakers' intent was. Whether they meant to portray Turing as straight, or to show that he was bisexual, or if they were trying to make a point that he was just as much a human being as the next person, doesn't matter to me. What matters is that the film shows Turing as being in a heterosexual relationship. It shows him being in a relationship with a woman. That is not true. He was not a heterosexual. He did not have a relationship with a woman. He was a homosexual. That is how he lived his life. My problem is not with the film's depiction of the gay sex scene in the film (I have no problem with that). My problem is with the filmmakers' decision to show Turing in a relationship with a woman, when in real life he was in a relationship with a man. I can only guess at the filmmakers' intent, but I feel like they decided that it would be unacceptable to show a man in a relationship with another man. That they decided that the only way to tell the story was to show him in a relationship with a woman. I think that they decided that the film would not be as commercially successful if they showed a man in a relationship with another man. I'm not saying that the film would not be commercially successful if they showed the relationship between Turing and his partner. I'm saying that I think the filmmakers felt that it would not be.

I think that they decided to show him in a relationship with a woman to make the film more commercially successful.

Think techies vs teemo, and heroes like tinker, meepo, lone druid, invoker, etc. LoL heroes typically have a couple skillshot nukes and a movement abillity as a rule of thumb. -Denying, highground miss chance, and pullingstacking make laning much more interesting in Dota. -Ancients and Roshan are much more interesting high value targets than Dragon or Baron. -Towers are much weaker in Dota, and smoke of deceit exists, allowing for much more aggressive gameplay. -Dota heros are much more turbocharged, any dota hero ported exactly would be the strongest champion in League of Legends. -Activatable items improve gameplay decisionmaking.

{"original_text": "First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people. I don't think I need to write an essay on it. I don't think I need to do anything but point out that the tradition of blackface is about two hundred years old, and that it's in the tradition of white people making fun of black people. I'd also like to point out that I'm not calling the use of blackface in the past \"wrong\" or \"bad\" though I'm not particularly a fan of the genre myself. The movie \"Bamboozled\" is a wonderful satirical take on the industry. However, in this particular case, I'm not talking about blackface at all, really, or at least I'm not talking about it in the same way. In this case, a white woman who has a black son and a black daughter-in-law and a black grandson is painting her face black to participate in a blackface party to support her black grandson who has cancer. And I'm just left wondering, what is wrong with this picture? The woman is supposed to feel bad? I'm sorry, but if my grandmother were to paint her face black to support me in some way, I'd be thrilled and would probably laugh my head off. I'd probably even take a photo of her to send to my friends. I'd be happy as a clam. And I'm black. I'd be proud of her for her dedication. In fact, I'd be proud of her for her devotion to me, and I'd take it as a sign that she is a good person. Isn't that the same thing she did? She painted her face to show support. If anything, her intentions were pure. She was just supporting her grandson. Is there really anything wrong with that? Are we going to say that a white woman can't paint her face black to support her black grandson with cancer? Are we going to say that we can't do anything that's fun, anything that's silly? Are we going to say that we can't joke around, because jokes are bad? Is there really a history of blackface being used for good? Yes. In fact, it's been used that way for years, and it's not a new thing. The tradition goes back to the late 19th century. Now, to be fair, the tradition of blackface in general is older, but black people have been using the tradition for a long time as well. A long time. Now, I'm not suggesting that we simply excuse this woman's actions because she was trying to help her grandson. I'm not saying she was right or that she should have done it. I'm just asking one simple question: is this really that bad? Is there really any reason to be upset about this? Wasn't she trying to help her grandson? Yes, she was. Isn't that what we want? She was trying to help her grandson. She wasn't trying to be offensive. She wasn't trying to hurt him or to do anything to him that wasn't good. In fact, she was trying to do something good for him. She was trying to support him. She was trying to raise awareness of his condition. It was just a mistake. It was just a misunderstanding. And now it's being blown out of proportion. What is the lesson here? Is it that we're not allowed to paint our face black because it might offend someone? Is it that we're not allowed to joke around or do anything fun? Is it that we can't even try to support our family and friends? The bottom line is this: this woman was trying to do something good, and she made a mistake. She didn't realize that what she did would offend people, but she was trying to support her grandson. She was trying to help him. There's nothing wrong with that. It's not the mistake of a bad person. It's not the mistake of someone who is trying to hurt. It's the mistake of someone who was trying to help. And what's so wrong about that?

{"original_text": "Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich. However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons: First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were \"more equal than the others.\" Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people's inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. Second of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it.

However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons: First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were \"more equal than the others.\" Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people's inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. Second of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it.

{"original_text": "I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at the keys. This is a problem. When we were kids, we were taught how to write. We were taught how to write cursive (even though it's becoming obsolete). We were taught how to spell correctly, and we were taught grammar. We were taught how to express our thoughts on paper. We were taught how to use a pen. Nowadays, we have a completely different tool to write with. We have computers. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to use them. This is the point of this blog. To teach people how to use the computer. Think of it as the place where a computer is taught how to teach a computer. Before I begin, I'd like to say that I've been using a keyboard for quite a while, but only recently have I become a touch typist. I'm not a professional typist by any means, but I know a bit about the subject. If you have any questions or any suggestions, please leave a comment on this post. We're going to start off by learning how to touch type. To do this, we're going to need some software. There's a variety of software out there, but I'm going to use TypeFu for this blog. It's a free software that does a pretty good job of teaching you how to type. Download the file from here. Then, download the font pack from here. Then, install TypeFu and run it. It should look like this. You should see a screen with a big smiley face, and the word \"start.\" Click the start button. This will bring you to the next screen. This screen is where you choose the level you're going to be playing at. Beginner is a bit too easy, and expert is a bit too hard. I recommend that you start off at \"intermediate.\" You should see a screen that looks like this. You can see the keyboard on the right hand side of the screen. This is where you start typing. You should see the letters flashing as you type. You should also see the current words-per-minute flashing on the top of the screen. You should type the letters as fast as you can. If you do it right, you'll see the letters flying down to the bottom of the screen. Type the letters as quickly as you can, and the word will eventually get sent to the bottom of the screen. When you finish typing a word, you'll see a little smiley face at the bottom. This means that you've done a good job. If you make a mistake, the smiley face will look like this. If you make too many mistakes, you'll see a frowny face. After you've typed a word, you'll get another word. You should keep on typing until the screen tells you to stop. If you get enough words right, you'll get a smiley face. After you get 20 words right, you'll get a smiley face. After you get 50 words right, you'll get a congratulation message, and you'll be moved on to the next level. So, that's how you type. Now, I'll go through the theory of touch typing. TypeFu has a practice mode and a game mode. The practice mode is good for getting you used to typing. The game mode is good for learning how to type really quickly. When you're learning how to type, you should always be on practice mode. This is because you should always be getting every letter right. If you make a mistake, you can't get a perfect score, and that's no fun. When you're typing on practice mode, you should always be typing the letters as fast as you can. If you're not typing fast, you're going to get bored. It's a lot more fun to type really quickly. You'll notice that the game is a bit difficult at first. You'll find that your fingers get really tired after a while. You'll find that you type more and more mistakes as you keep playing. However, if you keep on playing, you'll find that it gets easier. Your fingers will stop getting tired after a while, and you'll type less and less mistakes. You'll get more words right, and the game will get a bit easier. However, this doesn't mean that it's going to be a walk in the park. As you get better at the game, you'll find that", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "If you've ever used a keyboard, you'll know that it's much easier to type on a keyboard than it is on a paper keyboard."}

{"original_text": "So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern weapons are designed to be efficient in their purpose, and given the frequency that they are used in modern society, it seems that they have been effective in being just that. Most modern guns are used by citizens in the U.S. for sport or for the purpose of self-defense. My father is an avid hunter and owns more guns than I'd ever care to count. I'm not a fan of hunting, but I understand that it is a large part of American culture and that some people get a lot of enjoyment out of it. For those who get joy out of going out and hunting deer or other game, it seems wrong to take away that aspect of their life. Also, there is the argument of self-defense. Even though gun related violence is a huge problem in the U.S., the fact still remains that if everyone owned a gun, there would be less crime. If a criminal knows that there is a good chance that any of his victims could be armed, he is much more likely to think twice before committing a crime. Also, for people who live in unsafe areas, like poorer parts of town or in rural areas, having a gun is much more of a necessity. I have an aunt who lives in a rural part of Mississippi and she owns a gun because of the amount of violence that goes on where she lives. Having a gun in her home gives her security that she could never have without it. On the other side of this argument, I completely understand the other side. Gun violence is a huge problem in the U.S. Every day, children, teenagers, and adults are killed by guns. Whether it be a suicide or a homicide, the amount of deaths that result from guns is a huge problem. I can't imagine what it would be like to lose a child or a loved one to gun violence. It's a nightmare that no one should have to go through. The way that gun violence affects our society is a huge problem and it is something that should be fixed. However, I don't think that taking away guns from everyone is the answer. I think that our gun laws need to be reformed, but I don't think that we should ban guns completely. I think that people who do not have a criminal record should be able to own a gun for sport or self-defense. However, I do think that there should be more restrictions on how much ammo people can purchase and that there should be more stringent background checks. I don't think that people should be able to purchase handguns without going through a background check. Also, I think that there should be more restrictions on what types of guns can be sold. I don't think that citizens should be allowed to own a machine gun or a gun that can kill a lot of people in a short amount of time. These types of guns should be reserved for people who work in the military. I think that people should be allowed to own a hunting rifle, but I don't think that they should be allowed to own a gun that is capable of killing 20 people in a second. Given the fact that gun violence is a huge problem in the U.S., I think that there needs to be some reform in the way that we handle the gun laws in this country. I think that we need to have a more stringent background check process for people to purchase guns. I think that there should be more restrictions on what types of guns can be purchased, but I do think that people should be allowed to have a gun for sport or for self-defense. I think that we need to put more restrictions on the amount of ammo that people can purchase, and I think that there should be a waiting period for people to purchase guns. I do not, however, think that we should ban guns completely. I think that guns should be reserved for people who are responsible enough to own one. If people can go through the proper process, they should be allowed to purchase a gun if they want to, but I do think that there should be a lot of restrictions on the types of guns that people can buy. Guns should not be available for purchase to everyone, they should be reserved for those people who are responsible enough to own a gun.

I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting people up with downvotes. I will try to explain my opinion. WARNING: looong rant ahead. I first watched Breaking Bad. I've never been into TV shows since they tend to be time consuming and (IMO) tend to appeal to a broader audience, but since everyone told me to watch it I did. There are definitely some high points in the show: Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Giancarlo Esposito gave terrific performances, and without them I think the show would not have had the success it had. Gus' arc is IMO the peak of the show, with Gus' back story and general awesomeness. The other characters though, feel irrelevant and without much to offer. There is the cop who conveniently discovers Heisenberg's identity on the toilet, his wife who is just.... There, and the same goes for Walter's son. Skylar is a hypocrite and exists only to judge others from her morality horse. The other villains are forgettable and the psycho that appears towards the end of the show is a convenient plot device to kill Jesse's love interest and doesn't have any interesting trait. He's completely unidimensional. In the end, the series felt like an action movie with a few interesting characters and some pretty good cinematography, but nothing mind blowing. I still liked it though and I can see why people like it but if this is considered the best TV show ever, then I question TV shows' quality. Now for Game of Thrones: I didn't read the books nor do I intend to unless it's significantly better than the show. I will try to keep my cool but I really DESPISE this show. I feel about it the same way I feel about Attack On Titan (yes, I hate that one too): interesting premise, terrible characters and pacing, and lots of CHEAP. SHOCK. VALUE. The show always goes for the most shocking outcomes for the sake of shock value. People praise this show for being unpredictable and killing off anyone without distinction. Yet all the people who die are COMPLETE FUCKING IDIOTS and their deaths feel forced to avoid, god forbid, that the story might start getting going. When the Stark guy knows the King's wife has an incestous affair and suspects her to have tried to kill a fucking child, the guy who loves his wife tells him not to trust him and his daughter tells him about people wanting him DEAD he just claims the Iron Throne without considering that maybe, just MAYBE, he could get arrestedkilled. He could singlehandedly fix the corruption of the South, or at least try to while others tried to kill him, but we can't have that, now can we? The story must keep not going anywhere. If his death could have been at least plausible then it would have been okay. Then there is the dragon girl, who gets married to someone she doesn't love, is raped and then just falls in love with him. Dafuq, Stockholm's syndrome maybe? And at the end of season 3 we have other Starks dying because they're complete fools. Marrying another woman when you have already promised to marry the daughter of a powerful ally sure is a bright move, Einstein! After that I just dropped the series. It's just like a soap opera, with tons of violence and sex, where characters who are considered \"grey\" are just flat without any interesting development other than the dwarf (I don't even remember those guys names) and maybe the Stark tomboy little girl and the Stark who is at the Night Watch. There is a woman with an incestous affair with his pretty brother, a king who likes drinking, eating and fucking, a king who's a naive imbecile, a dragon girl with Stockholm's syndrome who becomes a badass cuz DRAGONS, a psychopathic teen king who somehow still hasn't died in 3 seasons, a guy whose penis makes the thinking and dooms his family to death, etc. THIS is considered good TV.

{"original_text": "I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically, the cost of coal is huge, both to human health and to the environment, and we need an alternative. The first concern I have is the storage of nuclear waste. It seems to me that the storage of nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain and similar facilities is a dangerous and short-sighted idea. In terms of geologic time, these sites are pretty new, and the containers being used aren't very good at keeping waste radioactive for millions of years. Radioactive waste is dangerous for very long periods of time, so long-term storage in sites like Yucca Mountain seems like a bad idea. The other concern I have is the use of nuclear weapons. I'm not terribly worried about the potential use of nuclear weapons by terrorists, because I don't think they have the resources to actually acquire them, and if they did, it's likely they'd be unable to actually deploy them. But we can't rely on that indefinitely. We know that the US and USSR both had nuclear weapons, and we know that the US used them in World War II. We also know that the US, USSR, France, the UK, China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea have all had nuclear weapons, and that Israel has had them for a long time but is unwilling to officially admit to it. We also know that South Africa had nuclear weapons but gave them up. We don't really know what all the other countries in the world are doing, but it seems unlikely that only these countries have been involved in the nuclear arms race. It's entirely possible that Iran, or Iraq, or Libya, or any number of other countries have or had nuclear weapons. In that case, we don't really have much to stop them from using them. If Iran has nuclear weapons, there's not a lot we can do to stop them from using them. If they feel threatened enough, or if they're crazy enough, or if they feel that they have nothing to lose, they could use their nuclear weapons. I'm hoping that enough people in Iran are reasonable enough not to want to use them, but I can't be certain. And if Iran does have nuclear weapons, then other countries in the Middle East will probably want to have them too. It's likely that Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and other countries will probably want to have nuclear weapons in order to protect themselves. This is where it gets interesting. If we can't prevent Iran from having nuclear weapons, can we prevent any country from having them? It seems like the only way to prevent any country from having nuclear weapons is to prevent any country from using nuclear weapons. The only way to do that is to use nuclear weapons ourselves. We've done that once before, and we've shown that it's possible. But we also showed that it's not a very good idea, because using nuclear weapons against other countries has the potential to start a nuclear war, which would kill millions of people. That seems to be the situation we're in right now. We're at an impasse where it seems likely that Iran will develop nuclear weapons, which will put pressure on other countries to also develop nuclear weapons. If we could prevent nuclear weapons from being developed, that would be good, but I'm not sure how to do that. Besides, nuclear weapons aren't the only dangerous weapons we have. We have chemical weapons and biological weapons too. We used chemical weapons in Iraq and Vietnam, and we have the capacity to use biological weapons. So even if we could prevent nuclear weapons from being developed, we still wouldn't be safe. It seems to me that the only way to prevent dangerous weapons from being developed is to prevent dangerous weapons from being used. It doesn't seem likely that we can prevent dangerous weapons from being used. It seems likely that other countries will develop nuclear weapons, whether we want them to or not. And if they do develop them, they'll probably want to use them. We're at an impasse. We're trying to develop better ways of doing things, but we're also trying to develop better ways of killing people. We're not going to be able to stop killing people, but we might be able to make it more difficult.

{"original_text": "Consent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved, allowing you to communicate what you do and don't like, and negotiate. It's also a necessary component of any sexual act that you do not feel pressured to do something that you don't want to do. Sex is a mutual thing, and both of you should be willing and interested in the act - consent is just there to help you make sure that this is the case. But what if someone just doesn't consent to sex? This article will focus on cases in which someone has consented to some sexual activity but not all. This could happen in a variety of situations, from a one-night stand, to a long-term relationship, and with a variety of people. Let's be real, consent and communication are pretty new things in sex - they certainly weren't taught in school and there's still a lot of cultural pressure to do things that make us feel uncomfortable. There are a lot of things that can make it difficult to be clear with your partner. It can be hard to know what's okay and what isn't okay to say. It can be difficult to be assertive and ask for what you want, especially when you don't know what you want and you're still figuring things out. There is a lot of pressure to 'perform' and be 'good' in sex. It can be difficult to ask for what you want, especially if you're worried about hurting their feelings or making them feel bad. It can be difficult to ask for what you want if you've never asked for it before, or never been asked for it before. It can be difficult to be direct and assertive if you're worried that they will get defensive, or you think they might stop being interested in you. It can be difficult to say 'no' if you're worried about disappointing them, or if they're already midway through something. It can be difficult to say 'no' when you're already having sex. It can be difficult to be clear with someone you're in a relationship with, especially if you're worried they'll think that you're not attracted to them or you're not enjoying sex with them. It can be difficult to tell someone who is a lot more experienced than you are. There's a lot of pressure on people to make it 'good'. There's a lot of pressure to say yes, or to do something because you've already done it before. There can be pressure to say yes, even if you don't want to do it. It can be difficult to tell someone that you don't want to do something, because you're worried about how they'll react. There can be pressure to be silent and just go along with things, especially if you've already said yes to something.

But I don't think a 100 platonic relationship can exist between a 18 year old guy and a 23 year old woman. As I said before I am 16 and have no real experience with adult relationships but I do know that if I was 23 and liked a 18 year old guy I would be interested in more than a friendship. Also I'm not trying to sound mean or anything but I don't really get what you mean by \"my personality suits me more to a younger crowd.\" Maybe I'm a bit biased because I am 16 but I don't think that just because your not interested in a 23 year old that that means you should date someone younger than you. Toni, you're totally right. There's no way a 100 platonic relationship can exist between an 18-year-old guy and a 23-year-old woman. Not with a guy. I've been in a similar situation and let me tell you: it doesn't work. I was 18 and in love with my 23-year-old step sister. She was married and my best friend, but that didn't stop me from telling her how I felt. And it didn't stop her from taking advantage of that either. You see, she was actually a little bit of a gold digger. She had a lot of money problems and I was always the one who would give her money. I was also the one who was always there for her to talk to. That's the relationship I wanted to have with her. I didn't want to be her sugar daddy, I didn't want to be her lover. I just wanted to be her best friend. But it didn't work out like that. So, if you're serious about staying platonic, don't make any promises to a guy that you can't keep. You can say \"I like you as a friend\" as much as you want, but he won't understand what you mean. He'll think he has a chance, and you have to be careful not to let him down. Lol! I'm 16 and my best friend's a 22 year old woman. I wouldn't call it \"bias,\" but I do feel a little more comfortable around older people. I don't know why, but it's just the way it is. I'm not saying I don't enjoy being around teenagers, but I'm saying that I enjoy being around people who are more mature. I also think that people around my age can be immature and, well, annoying. I have two other best friends who are both 21 years old, and they're really great people. I don't know what I'd do without them. I've been best friends with them for about three years now, and they've been with me through everything. When my mom died, my 21-year-old friend was there for me. When I was bullied in school, my 21-year-old friends were there for me. When I needed advice on anything, my 21-year-old friends were there for me. They've never done anything to hurt me, and they've never broken my trust. I've also been dating my 22-year-old friend for two years now, and I think it's going great. It's a lot more mature than relationships I've had in the past. I'm not saying I don't enjoy being around teenagers, but I do feel a little more comfortable around older people.

The point is that asians and whites have it harder, which is unfair. What about the white or asian kid that is as qualified as a black or hispanic kid. Why should the asian kid not have the same opportunity as the black kid? The asian kid did just as well as the black kid and heshe did not have the opportunity to get in. That is unfair.

But that is just my personal point of view. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using chopsticks instead of cutlery? cutlery chopsticks I think a big advantage is that it's very easy to learn and use. - Joe Sep 23 '11 at 15:33 Joe: I can use cutlery too. I also know how to knit. But I won't use either of them. - Martin Schroder Sep 23 '11 at 15:37 In my experience, chopsticks are much better for picking up items like edamame (soy beans in the pod) and boba (tapioca balls) than cutlery. As for cutlery, forks are better than knives and spoons for eating rice, and spoons are better than forks for noodles. It's hard to find a perfect combination. - Joe Sep 23 '11 at 15:44 Joe: I think it's more that there's not a perfect combination of utensils for all foods. Chopsticks don't work well for rice, but they're good for a lot of other foods. - Joe Sep 23 '11 at 16:28 SachinKainth: I'm not saying they're the same. I'm saying that most of the time, I can get by with just chopsticks, so I don't need to carry around cutlery. - Joe Sep 23 '11 at 16:36 I would have to say the biggest advantage is portability. You can eat with chopsticks anywhere. If you're doing takeout at home, a single pair of chopsticks can serve you and whoever you're sharing with. I usually throw a pair in my desk at work and eat with them sometimes during my lunch break. They're a bit awkward to use, but you can still eat. Restaurants are able to serve more people, as you can easily share a pair of chopsticks between people, or even share a pair between multiple courses, since the only part that touches the food is the top 1-2 inches. I used to think they were more efficient for eating rice, but I have learned that you can use a fork to pick up a rice ball and eat it as you would a cake or slice of bread. Rice balls are delicious. If you're eating a lot of noodles, chopsticks are not the most efficient, since they don't allow you to cut or tear the noodles. I agree that chopsticks are more portable and you can have more of them. I also agree that you can share them, but in a restaurant you will get several pairs of cutlery and you don't need to share them with others. So I'd say that it's not really a big advantage. - Martin Schroder Sep 23 '11 at 16:02 MartinSchroder You can bring a pair of chopsticks anywhere you can bring a set of cutlery. It's easier to carry a single pair of chopsticks than a fork, knife, and spoon (or a fork, knife, and fork). - Joe Sep 23 '11 at 16:05 Joe: True. I was thinking more of eating out in a restaurant or going to a friend's place. It's just that I never go to a restaurant without my cutlery. I always go with knife, fork and spoon. - Martin Schroder Sep 23 '11 at 16:08 MartinSchroder Fair enough. I often forget to bring my cutlery with me, since I don't have a convenient place to keep it. I always have chopsticks, though, since they're cheap and you can get them anywhere. - Joe Sep 23 '11 at 16:11 Joe: I always have a set of cutlery in my car.

{"original_text": "When I hear people talking about 'a second revolution' in America, it makes me roll my eyes. Historically speaking, revolutions don't seem to have a high success rate, if you define a successful revolution as one that overthrows the established power and sets up a superior government to previous one, I would say that most revolutions don't work out well. The American Revolution is the only one I can think of that didn't make the country worse off than before -and that is sort of debatable- and set up a functional government. Now when I look at recent uprisings in Libya and Syria, I can't see armed rebellion ever being a good alternative. How many people have been killed in the Syria uprising? How many cities and towns have been ruined? A lot more than would have been without a rebellion. More so now than before, with how destructive our weaponry is, if a rebellion doesn't achieve a quick and decisive victory the country will be torn apart and the winner will be picking up the broken, shattered pieces of a nation. TL;DR Revolutions usually aren't historically successful without incredible loss of life and generally result in an inferior government or one that is no better than the one overthrown.

The American Revolution is the only one I can think of that didn't make the country worse off than before -and that is sort of debatable- and set up a functional government. Now when I look at recent uprisings in Libya and Syria, I can't see armed rebellion ever being a good alternative. How many people have been killed in the Syria uprising? How many cities and towns have been ruined? A lot more than would have been without a rebellion. More so now than before, with how destructive our weaponry is, if a rebellion doesn't achieve a quick and decisive victory the country will be torn apart and the winner will be picking up the broken, shattered pieces of a nation. TL;DR Revolutions usually aren't historically successful without incredible loss of life and generally result in an inferior government or one that is no better than the one overthrown.

{"original_text": "During the first week alone [32 million people] downloaded a copy of a Game of Thrones episode. Even if only 1 of those people keep the file they downloaded after watching it, that's 32 million copies of a show that didn't cost a penny to produce. And that's not the only thing that's been pirated, either. The release of a whole series on DVD is now a risk that studios take. DVD sales have dropped precipitously in the past few years, and it is because of piracy. So I think that when studios release a movie on DVD they should also release a digital version of the movie at the same time. They can do it on a platform that they control. They could even charge a premium for it. In fact, the studios could even use this to their advantage by creating a digital storefront where they could sell movies and series and even other merchandise. And they could use this same storefront to sell tickets to movies. What would this look like? I'm not entirely sure, but it would most likely be a website. People would go there and sign up and then pay a monthly fee. This fee could be tiered depending on what you're interested in. For example, you could pay 10 a month for access to new movie releases, or 15 a month for access to new movies and television shows, or 20 a month for all of the above and a 20 discount on any merchandise. Now, some of you might be wondering why I'm including a discount on merchandise, but I think that's part of what you'd need to include to make this viable. The problem is that piracy is free and it's easy. This is what needs to be overcome. If I'm going to pay money for movies that I could get for free, I'm going to need a lot of incentive. So it's not just about the movies. It's also about the extras. And that's something that piracy doesn't offer. Pirates can't watch a movie in theaters, and they can't own the merchandise. They can't go to the website and buy a t-shirt or a coffee mug with a movie's logo on it. They can't talk about the movies in the forums. Because of this, you would have a much more engaged audience. They're the kind of people who are willing to pay a premium, and that's something that you can't say about pirates. This would also be the best way to combat piracy. By offering a digital option, the studios could cut off a number of illegal distribution sites. They could also shut down the peer-to-peer networks. There would still be people who would find a way to pirate the movies, but it would be more difficult. The less accessible it is, the less people will want to do it. It would also mean that they'd have to buy the movies in order to watch them, which is something that I think would be a worthwhile trade-off for the industry. As for how the studios would release the movies, I'm not entirely sure. They could release them the same way that television shows are now. If you subscribe to Netflix or Hulu, you get access to a lot of different shows. The same could be done with the movies. You could watch the movies as soon as they're released, or you could wait until a certain date and have a greater selection of them. The great thing about this is that it's all digital. There's no need to press DVDs or Blu-rays, and there's no need to ship them out. This would save the studios a lot of money. I've been a proponent of this idea for a long time, and I'm not the only one. A lot of people are starting to come around to it, but I think it's going to be a while before it becomes a reality. The thing is, I think it would be a good way to combat piracy. It would also be good for the studios. It would give them a source of income that they wouldn't have before. There are a lot of people who would be willing to pay money for the convenience of having new movies made available to them. But I think it's also important to point out that the studios shouldn't just make the digital option available to people in the US. The same should be done for every country. Studios should make the digital option available to everyone.

I am sure we all have heard the phrase \" Police officers have the right to shoot to kill, if they are threatened.\" This is wrong, because police officers have been abusing the law system and it has been so since the beginning of the law system.

Because he was scared of the cop, and the cop was scared of the kid. This is just a scenario, and I bet it has happened. What about if it was the cop that had died? Would the police officer have died in this case? No. Police officers are supposed to help people, not kill them. They have the right to use force, but not deadly force. Police officers should think first before pulling the trigger, are they going to regret shooting this person? The answer is probably yes, they are going to regret it.

{"original_text": "Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for \"sleeping around,\" and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for \"sleeping around.\" My argument for the first statement is simple: we are not discussing whether or not \"sleeping around\" is a bad thing, but rather if it is justified. It is justified because, for a man, a high number of sexual partners is seen as a sign of social success. My argument for the second statement is also simple: society has a double standard, and the idea that a man who sleeps around is a \"stud\" is an expression of that double standard. To put it another way, it is a part of a system of \"gender inequality.\" If you're willing to take these two statements for granted, then the rest of this post is directed at a specific point of contention: the idea that \"gender inequality\" is a bad thing. First, we have to make a distinction between two things. I am going to call them \"gender inequality\" and \"gender equity.\" Gender inequality is the idea that men and women are treated differently by society in many ways. Gender equity is the idea that men and women should be treated identically by society. It is my position that we should strive for gender equity, but we should not necessarily strive for gender equality. The reason I draw this distinction is because in some ways, men and women should not be treated equally. That is, there is a difference between the sexes that should be recognized. For example, women bear children, and men do not. Therefore, women have a childbirth experience that men cannot have. It is unrealistic, and frankly wrong, to say that these two experiences are the same. It is also unrealistic and wrong to say that they should be treated equally, because they are different. It is true that women have certain rights over their bodies that men do not have (e.g. the right to choose to have an abortion), but it is equally true that men have certain rights over their bodies that women do not have (e.g. the right to not get pregnant). So in some ways, gender inequality is realistic, justified, and fair. The fact that I have a penis and my girlfriend does not is realistic. The fact that I am physically more capable of fending off a potential attacker than she is is realistic. The fact that my sex drive is, on average, higher than hers is realistic. The fact that my experience of pregnancy is different than hers is realistic. All of these things are gender inequality, and I do not feel that it is fair to call them \"gender inequality\" and use the term as an insult. Now let's turn to the more sensitive issues. My position is that a woman should have every right to participate in sexual intercourse that a man does, and she should not have to worry about being judged by society for her sexual behavior. My position is also that a man should have every right to participate in sexual intercourse that a woman does, and he should not have to worry about being judged by society for his sexual behavior. But my position is that it is not the job of society to judge anyone for his or her sexual behavior. It is not the job of society to judge anyone for the way he or she looks. It is not the job of society to judge anyone for the way he or she talks, or the way he or she dresses. It is the job of society to ensure that every person has equal rights and is treated fairly. So to me, gender inequality is not only realistic, it's justified. Gender equity, on the other hand, is a goal we should strive for. And we have a long way to go before we get there.

What do you think stayed? the computer or the kid's bunkbeds? The racecar bed or the big screen TV? The kids shit went almost every time. It scarred me permanently. Oh there were some perks, like driving around on our biggest collection day (Saturday) and going from strip club to strip club collecting money from our customers that were dancers. And my finest memory, the time when we enforced a repossession bond with the help of local law enforcement, and I got to stand there in front of this lady screaming at me, clawing at my with her blood red gnarled fingers, while the sheriff held her back, while I took each and every one of her bedroom dressers and emptied the contents into a pile on the roach infested floor. God that was glorious. It was 5 years of hell, and I challenge you to change my view on why that isn't one of, if not the worst jobs in America. Edit: formatting Hello, users of CMV!

Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions but poorly executed, to say the least. In the video below, Scott Adams (creator of the comic strip \"Dilbert talks about what he calls \"Identity Bubbles.\" Adams describes how your Facebook feed and Twitter feed are perfectly tailored to your beliefs, and that you're never exposed to any alternative viewpoints. You can choose to unfriend anyone who disagrees with you, and block any posts or comments that you find objectionable. This is especially true of Twitter. If you post something on Twitter that is even mildly controversial, you're likely to get a barrage of people telling you how awful of a person you are. And if it's particularly controversial, your account will probably be suspended. Twitter is especially bad because it's not a big, open forum like Facebook. It's more like a small, closed group of like-minded individuals, and if you disagree with the majority then you're kicked out. And that's what's so dangerous about all of this. The Internet is supposed to be a place where you can exchange ideas with people all over the world, but instead we've made it a place where we're only exposed to the same ideas we already agree with. It's a place where instead of dialogue we just scream at one another. If you watch the video you can see how it's not just \"right wingers\" who are guilty of this. In fact, it's typically more prevalent on the left. There's a lot of talk of \"tolerance\" and \"acceptance\" on the left, but at the same time they seem to be the ones least tolerant of other people's views. But you know what? That's not a big deal. As Adams says, you can't stop people from being a-holes. We just need to be more aware of our behavior, and understand that it's not always as clear-cut as we think.

{"original_text": "Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with most SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions, but it has been hijacked by a certain group of people who now hold the reigns, so to speak. Now, this is the part that I would like to get input on: I do not think that SJW's are as liberal as they would like to claim. In fact, I'd say that they are quite regressive. They claim to be progressive, but in reality they are extremely conservative in their views. The best example I can think of is a new phenomenon called \"cultural appropriation\" - essentially, if a white person wears dreadlocks, a sari or some other clothing item of a non-white culture, they are a racist and are committing a cultural appropriation. The underlying notion that cultural appropriation is racist is not a new thing. It's been around for decades. However, it is the SJW's that have recently decided to actually start doing something about it. To me, it seems like the SJW's are advocating for more conservative views in society. I mean, they are literally trying to stifle cultural exchange, and cultural exchange is a hallmark of liberalism. The whole notion of cultural appropriation is a regressive attitude, as it attempts to segregate people, cultures and societies. So, my question to you is: if the SJW's are not as liberal as they claim, who are they? Are they even liberals? I'm going to use the same definition for SJW's that I used for \"Liberals\" which is anyone who uses the label, because it's impossible to come up with a definition that everyone will agree on. So to answer your question, the answer is: \"It depends.\" SJW's range from people who are genuinely concerned about oppression and are looking to find ways to fight it, to people who want to feel like they're part of an elite group and will jump on any bandwagon that comes by. I'm sure there are also people who are just trolls, although I've personally not encountered very many of them. The overly conservative views are usually from people who are just blindly jumping on bandwagons and are not really engaged with the issue. They are just trying to impress their friends or look like they're morally superior. It's hard to tell because it's difficult to tell who's doing it for the right reasons, and who's doing it for the wrong reasons. A good example of this is the Star Wars controversy where people were claiming that Rey's parentage was \"spoiled\" in The Force Awakens. (It wasn't, but that's not the point.) At the time I saw a lot of SJWs jumping on the bandwagon, saying that Rey's parents should have been \"people of color,\" even though that had never been a part of the issue. The fact is that nobody cared who Rey's parents were, but SJWs were simply looking for something to be outraged about and in this case they found it. I'm not saying they were wrong for wanting Rey to be non-white, but they weren't right either. It was simply a case of people trying to use a popular topic in order to make a statement. The other aspect of \"cultural appropriation\" is a bit harder to gauge. Is it racist? I'm not so sure. I've never been \"culturally appropriated\" because I don't have a culture to appropriate. My ancestors were Irish, English and French, but I don't feel a connection to any of those cultures, and no one else does either. If someone wears a kilt or puts green on for St. Patrick's Day I don't feel like they're \"appropriating\" my culture. So I don't think it's necessarily racist. But it's also not necessarily right. If you're wearing dreadlocks or a Native American headdress, then you're wearing it for fashion and not as part of your culture, and that's a bit pretentious. And if you're wearing it as part of a costume, then you're being disrespectful to the culture it came from. It's not racist, but it's not right either. While I'm sure there are people who think it's racist, I", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "The Social Justice Warriors (SJW) are a left-leaning movement that has recently been hijacked by a certain group of people who now hold the reigns."}

{"original_text": "Improv, as an art form, is a medium almost exclusively to be enjoyed live. SNL, while having improvised elements, does not fall in this category because most skits are rehearsed and written to be performed live in front of a studio audience. Improv is a medium that is a product of the moment. What is said in any given scene can never be said again and the audience must be present in order to experience it. This is why live theater and improv are so incredibly special. You can only experience a live show once and this is why theater and improv are such popular forms of entertainment. Another reason why live theater is so important is because of the shared experience between the performers and the audience. It is a unique experience that cannot be replicated in any other way. Improv is a medium that relies on audience participation in order to be successful. The audience must be engaged with the performers in order for a scene to be successful. They have to be as much a part of the performance as the performers themselves. Audience and performers feed off of each other's energy and this is what makes the experience so special. The audience is a vital part of an improv show. Some say that improv is a dying art form and is not as popular as it was in the past. However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not the case. While improv is not as popular as it once was, it is still a very important and thriving art form. It is important to keep in mind that improv is a medium that is designed to be experienced live. Going to see a live improv show is a unique experience that can never be replicated in any other way. It is an important part of the culture and we must do everything we can to make sure that it lives on.", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "In our series of letters from African-American journalists, film-maker and columnist Richard Roeper looks at the importance of improv and how it affects our culture."}

{"original_text": "For those who don't know, the trolley problem is this: You and another person are on a bridge which is over a trolley track. 5 people are tied to the track ahead, and a trolley is speeding toward them. You are standing next to a switch which can divert the trolley to a different track. On this track is one person. Should you pull the switch? In this problem, most people say that they should. This seems to be the case because most people are utilitarians. The greatest good for the greatest number of people is to kill one instead of 5. However, many people have a problem with this. They say that they should not pull the switch, because it is morally wrong to kill someone, regardless of the consequences. I have a problem with this, though. I think that these people are being very inconsistent. I think that if you truly believe this, you should never do anything that is for the greater good. This means that you should never do anything that you think is good, but that you are not certain is good. This is because, if you take the act of pulling the switch, you can see that there is the possibility of it being bad. If you believe that it is bad to kill one person for the greater good, you should not take the chance of it being bad, even if you believe that the act is good. This means that you should never do anything that is good unless you are certain that it is good. If you are certain that it is good, it is not for the greater good. This is why I think that most people who are against the trolley problem are inconsistent. They say that they should not pull the switch, and then they go out and do good things. I am not certain what the solution to this is, or even if there is a problem with it, but I do think it is something worth thinking about. I have found another trolley problem, but it is in another language. I will translate it to English as best I can. There is a runaway trolley coming down a track towards 5 people who are tied to the track. You are standing next to a switch which will divert the trolley to another track. A person is on this track. You can pull the switch, but you will not be able to warn the person in time. Would you pull the switch? I have a few problems with this. First of all, it doesn't tell you if you are closer to the switch or the person. This is important, because if you are closer to the switch, you could run and tell the person, and then pull the switch. If you are closer to the person, you can tell him, but you can't pull the switch in time. Second, you will not be able to warn the person in time. This means that you can't save the 5 people on the track, so why not just stay there and die with them? If you really believe that you shouldn't kill one person to save 5, why don't you just die with the 5 people? Third, the trolley problem is about a trolley. This means that it should be about a trolley. A trolley is a different vehicle than a car, so there shouldn't be a car problem. Fourth, why can't you just jump in front of the car? It seems like a pretty easy way to save the 5 people. Fifth, if you can't warn the person, then why can you pull the switch? The person cannot see the switch, so he cannot know that it will save his life. The only way that you can save the 5 people is if the person knows that he can save his life by pulling the switch. If he cannot know, then there is no reason for him to pull the switch, so there is no reason for you to pull the switch.

You have to consider that in a wireless mouse you have to think about the battery level and remember to keep it topped up to avoid not being able to use the mouse. No such problem exists with a wired mouse. 2. A wireless mouse requires two pieces of equipment (the mouse and the USB stick). A fault in either of those and you may not use your mouse.

You may do a presentation and want to click remotely, but unless you're doing them everyday, it doesn't compensate. 4. A wired mouse is cheaper and does the exact same thing. 5.

{"original_text": "First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and I have some opinions about a very sensitive and subjective topic. I am a fan of the Washington Redskins. I have been one since I was a little kid. I remember watching them win Super Bowl XXII with Doug Williams and coming home and telling my parents that I wanted to be an NFL quarterback. Needless to say, my dreams never worked out. However, my fandom for the Redskins has never waned. Even when they were bad, I was a fan. They are my team. I have defended them through thick and thin. But in recent years, I have struggled to do so. I have come to realize that I don't have to defend my team. If I don't like something about them, I have the right to say so. Such is the case with their nickname. I have always defended the nickname. I have never understood why Native Americans would be offended by it. After all, they called themselves that. It is a proud name. It is a name that the people of the region used to use. I get it. I understand that. I don't think the name is meant to offend anyone. In my opinion, the name was given to the team as a sign of respect. But then I read the opinion of a Native American and I realized that I had never considered how this name may affect them. A Native American woman named Amanda Blackhorse wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post. She is a member of the Navajo Nation and she is the lead plaintiff in a case that is trying to get the trademark of the Redskins name removed. \"I can't even imagine what it would be like to grow up in a world where you were free to be just as good as anybody else. I wonder what that would feel like. I know my grandmother grew up in a world like that. She grew up in a world where you could be just as good as anybody else. \"My grandmother is 92 years old. She saw her first airplane when she was 16. When I think about what that must have been like for her, it's hard for me to imagine. \"When I think about the word redskin, I wonder what it would have been like for me to grow up in a world where I had the freedom to be just as good as anybody else. \"I wonder what it would have been like for me to be free to be just as good as anybody else.

She grew up in a world where she could be just as good as anybody else. This is a beautiful story that has stuck with me since I read it. It was something I had never really thought about before. I know that some of you will think I am being naive, but I really think I had never thought about it. I do not have children, but I have nieces and nephews who I love very dearly. I would never want anything to happen to them. I have tried to be as supportive as possible of them and their parents. I have tried to give them advice when they have asked for it.

I can't imagine how it would feel to have your child called a name that was derogatory. It would be horrible. I am not going to continue to defend this nickname any longer. I don't think that I have ever used the name with any ill intent, but I do not want to offend anyone. It is time for the Redskins to change their name. The only issue is what the name should be.

I think the majority of Gotham's problems could've solved with smart investments in social programs and industry and the police force which Bruce Wayne could've made anonymously to help the city long term. I mean Gotham's a thriving city with a lot of jobs even the poorest of the poor are working. There's a lot of things that the Wayne Foundation could've been doing to improve the city that aren't just putting people in jail for a little while, there are long term investments and projects that they could've been doing to make the city better. Bruce wasn't interested in investing in the city. He wanted to stop crime. He wanted to help those people who couldn't help themselves. At the same time, you gotta remember that this is not the Batman we're used to. He's been through some rough times and he's had enough of it. He's just sick and tired of it all, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to make it stop. He has a 'we're through the looking glass here, people' mentality. Bruce does have a point, there are a lot of things that can be done to help the city. But Bruce is also a man who has lost it all. This is a man who has seen his father and mother murdered in cold blood right in front of his own eyes. He's seen the city he loved turned into a hellhole. He's seen a lot of bad things in his life. You can't blame the man for wanting to see this all come to an end. I've never read the comics so I don't know about the backstory but I didn't think he was gonna just kill the Joker so he could go home and sleep in his bed. And that's what I don't get. If Batman had really been willing to kill the Joker, he would've done it when he had the chance. It's not that Batman is afraid to kill, he won't because it's the right thing to do. He's seen the bad side of killing, it has to be a last resort. Just a quick question: What does it mean to you, when you say Batman doesn't kill? Does it mean that he would never willingly kill under any circumstances? Or does it mean that he wouldn't willingly kill unless it's absolutely necessary? Well, I'm not saying that he's a pacifist, but he believes that killing is wrong and that it's not the way to solve problems. That doesn't mean he won't kill if he has to, but he will do whatever he can to find another way around it. I think Bruce Wayne was ready to do what he had to do to stop the Joker. I think that's the whole point of the film. Batman is someone who we've always looked up to, he's a hero. But at the end of the day, he's a man. Just like you and me. He's a man who's been through a lot of and he's just sick of it all. He's at the end of his rope, and he's gonna do whatever it takes to end it all. And in that moment, I think he was willing to kill the Joker. The only reason he didn't kill the Joker was because he saw the innocent little girl that he had to save. And the Joker saved him in a way. He saved him by giving him the hope to carry on. Batman has always been a hero. The end of the film reinforces that. Bruce Wayne was a symbol of hope. A symbol of justice. It doesn't matter what he looks like, what matters is that he's willing to do what it takes to save the city. The Joker was right when he said that Batman didn't need to be a hero anymore. The city already had a hero. And that hero was the people. The people of Gotham, the police, the army, they were the ones who saved the day. And Batman was the symbol that gave them hope. That's what Batman is about. That's a very interesting perspective.

There's really no particular reason I do this other than I seem to do the best with Peach. When I won the grand prix my girlfriend said \"Ugh, I hate Peach, she's such a weak and stereotypical female video game character.\" To which I jokingly replied \"Wow, that's a SUPER sexist thing to say, and she's obviously not that weak since I crushed you with her.\" And her response to that was \"Peach negatively reinforces the idea that women are weak and can only be saved by men in power like Mario.\" Then I made the mistake of saying \"Well I don't think that's true.\" We ended up getting into an argument over the portrayal of females in video games and how that perpetuates stereotypes in the real world. Her main argument was that most females in video games are portrayed as weak and need help from the male characters and this is detrimental to women in real life. There were two issues I had with her argument, the first one being that there are a TON of badass female characters in video games who don't need no man: Samus, Rosalina, ZeldaSheik, Palutena, Bayonetta, Lara Croft, Ellie from the last of us, and GLaDOS (just to get a female villain in there). She shrugged this off by saying it's still not enough because male protagonist characters outnumber female characters in video games. I feel like she wouldn't be happy unless the numbers of male and female characters are exactly equal. The second, and main issue I had with her argument is even if all female characters were represented as weak and helpless, I sincerely doubt there is any correlation between these characters and real world issues for women. For me video games are make believe, fiction, and stories. They're imaginary worlds with imaginary characters. Saying the portrayal of women in video games perpetuates real societal problems for women (like pay inequality) is about as absurd to me as saying violence in video games perpetuates violence in real life, which from what I can tell [has been thoroughly debunked] . Most reasonable people realize that women don't wear bright pink dresses, pick vegetables with faces out of the ground, and get kidnapped from a giant turtledinosaur hybrid. I provided my argument, and also said if Mario's and Peach's roles were reversed I could seriously not care less, as long as the game was still fun. Her response was \"You won't ever understand because you're a guy.\" I tried to continue on the debate but was met with the same response every time: \"You won't ever understand because you're a guy.\" So here I am trying to change my view, while I may not agree with the feminist issue of women in video games, I feel like I'm more empathetic than what my girlfriend is giving me credit for. Have there been studies done about the portrayal of women in video gamesstories and their effects on society? Is there any hard evidence for this correlation?

{"original_text": "It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing they miss out is that China is also becoming a major player in the game of soft power. China is already ranked as one of the top countries in terms of tourism, and they have a huge cultural and media industry, and I think the strength of China's soft power is going to be the biggest surprise of the 21st century. I read a book called \"The rise of the rest\" by Fareed Zakaria. In the book, Zakaria argues that we will see a rise of the rest, and he thinks the rest will catch up with the west through education, infrastructure, and governance. The rest is defined by the countries that are in the middle or lower tier of the global economy. Zakaria doesn't include China in the rest because he thinks China is already a developed country, and will join the ranks of the west as a top global power. I think Zakaria is wrong. I think China is going to be a power of its own. China's rapid growth will benefit all of the \"rest,\" but it will not be like China. I believe that China's rise will be a hybrid of western capitalism and Chinese culture. It will be Chinese style democracy, with Chinese style free market. It will be a system that works for China and will not look like the west. It will be a new Chinese model that will not fit into any pre-existing categories. This new model will be different from the rest, and it will be a model that will benefit China, but not the rest. China is a country that doesn't just seek to be like the west. China wants to be its own China. I've been studying business for 5 years in college, and throughout those 5 years, I've learned that there's a lot of different types of businesses. The common ones are corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorship, and I've also learned about things like family businesses, and internet startups. However, as I study more about business, I find myself asking, what is the right business model? I feel like I'm having more and more trouble deciding what type of business model is good and what's not. The classic business model is the corporation, and I feel like most of the business books and courses are based on the assumption that all companies are corporations, and I think that's the biggest reason why people have trouble deciding on a business model. The corporate business model assumes that the business is a separate legal entity from the owners, and this doesn't apply to many businesses, especially internet startups. Another thing that bothers me about the corporate business model is that it's too limited. We've been using this same business model for over 100 years, and I think we need something new. I think business models need to evolve and the corporation should be just one of many possible options. We should start thinking about new business models, and I think one of the best places to look at is internet startups. Internet startups are not new, but I think they are still in a very early stage, and I think that's because we still haven't found the right business model for them. When people think about internet startups, they think of companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. But these are not typical internet startups. They are already big corporations, and they are already in the league of Microsoft and Apple. But most internet startups are very different from these corporations. They are not big, and they are not even businesses. They are more like projects that are funded by venture capitalists. The reason I don't consider internet startups as businesses is that many of them are not trying to make money, and they are not seeking to be profitable. So if they are not businesses, what are they? I don't really know, but I think we need to find a better business model for them. As I was thinking about the internet startup business model, I was thinking about my own internet project, and I think I have found a business model that I like. The project is a website that will help people find the right college, and this site is more like a blog or a forum than a typical website. The key to this site is that it will generate revenue from advertising and it will be free for the user. I will not charge any fee to access the site, and I will not sell any products or services. I think this is a good business model because I'm able to get the benefits of the internet without having to change the business model of the site.

Internet startups are not new, but I think they are still in a very early stage, and I think that's because we still haven't found the right business model for them. When people think about internet startups, they think of companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. But these are not typical internet startups. They are already big corporations, and they are already in the league of Microsoft and Apple. But most internet startups are very different from these corporations. They are not big, and they are not even businesses. They are more like projects that are funded by venture capitalists. The reason I don't consider internet startups as businesses is that many of them are not trying to make money, and they are not seeking to be profitable. So if they are not businesses, what are they? I don't really know, but I think we need to find a better business model for them. As I was thinking about the internet startup business model, I was thinking about my own internet project, and I think I have found a business model that I like. The project is a website that will help people find the right college, and this site is more like a blog or a forum than a typical website. The key to this site is that it will generate revenue from advertising and it will be free for the user. I will not charge any fee to access the site, and I will not sell any products or services. I think this is a good business model because I'm able to get the benefits of the internet without having to change the business model of the site. The site will"}

{"original_text": "I just read this [article] stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering the fact that they're supposedly giving out grants to improve the education of minorities, yet they're giving them a smaller chance to get in to a school. Another thing that pisses me off is the fact that they're so concerned about the diversity of their schools. What is so wrong about a school being mainly white? Doesn't the majority of the country happen to be white? Also, they're so concerned about \"whitening\" the schools. What is so bad about wanting to have a school full of white kids? I mean, is it really such a horrible thing? There's nothing wrong with a school being mostly white, black, hispanic, or asian. I'm really frustrated right now, and I'm just really curious as to what you guys think of this whole mess. EDIT This is what the article I read said, it seems that they're giving blacks and hispanics a lower GPA requirement, and they're using that as a means to get into school. This is just ridiculous. I don't know how long this article will be up, I just read it about an hour ago. I'm not sure of your source, but if it's true then it's obviously another example of the double standards in this country. Not so much double standards as different standards for different people. I'm not surprised at all by this, considering that asians (Japanese and Chinese) are the most educated people in the world. It would seem natural that they'd have a harder time getting into universities because their standards are already too high. These days, it's not so much about education as it is about popularity. I don't know what the world is coming to. I'm not sure of your source, but if it's true then it's obviously another example of the double standards in this country.I'm not sure where you're getting that, but if you look at the Washington Times article, it looks like there's a greater emphasis on grades and less emphasis on test scores. And this isn't a double standard. There are no rules against race-based admission policies in the Constitution. I'm not sure where you're getting that, but if you look at the Washington Times article, it looks like there's a greater emphasis on grades and less emphasis on test scores. True, but the article specifically mentions \"Asian Americans,\" as well as \"white\" students. Diversity is a wonderful thing and we should be promoting it. Minorities are given a lower GPA because they are more likely to come from a lower-class or broken home. As for the article, I'm not sure that is true. I did not know that. You would think that our country would be a little more educated than that. It's not. We're still a very racist country. I think it's a good thing, and we should promote it more. I think the standards should be equal for all minorities though. True, but the article specifically mentions \"Asian Americans,\" as well as \"white\" students.The article isn't specific. It says Asian-American and white students. It doesn't break it down by race. Minorities are given a lower GPA because they are more likely to come from a lower-class or broken home.I doubt this is the case. I've known people who went to public schools (and this is also the case with one of my friends) and their schools were rich with minorities. I did not know that. You would think that our country would be a little more educated than that.It's not. We're still a very racist country.It depends. We've come a long way. I'm not saying we're perfect, but we're a long way from where we were 50 years ago. I think it's a good thing, and we should promote it more.I agree. I think the standards should be equal for all minorities though.I'd have to see the policies. If they're helping minorities, that's a good thing.

My other view, is something I'd be happy to change. Children are bad for the individual because of many reasons. First and foremost, they cost way too much.

The entire argument is based on a fallacy, that being the idea that we can be certain of the truth value of a statement (outside of mathematics). The argument basically assumes that we can know with absolute certainty that the universe is deterministic, and therefore uses a logical deduction to determine that this would lead to a contradiction. The reason that this is a fallacy is that we cannot know that the universe is deterministic, the closest we can really get to knowing this would be to say that we don't know that it isn't deterministic. This would make the argument invalid, as it would be impossible to know that determinism is false, therefore it would be impossible to know that we have proven a contradiction. Furthermore, even if we could know with absolute certainty that determinism is true, it would be impossible to know that the \"you\" that is in the future is the same \"you\" that is in the past. If we assume that consciousness is not strictly deterministic, then it is impossible to know that the \"you\" that is in the past is the same \"you\" that will be in the future, so the argument breaks down. This is due to the idea that we cannot know what we will do in the future (as we are not strictly deterministic, assuming we have freewill), so we cannot know with absolute certainty that the \"you\" that is in the future is the same as the \"you\" in the past, and therefore we cannot know that it is impossible for the future \"you\" to make the exact same choice. There is also a fallacy in saying that the future is certain (as it assumes that the future is deterministic), as the past cannot be changed, so the future must be uncertain (as it would be impossible to know what actions are going to take place in the future), and the only way that this could be known is if the future was deterministic, and we could know the truth value of every statement (outside of mathematics), so we can never know the truth value of a statement. I have noticed that people often use the argument in response to the \"dream argument\" for solipsism. The dream argument is basically the idea that since it's possible that you're dreaming, then it's possible that the universe is just a dream, so it's possible that we are all just brains in jars. Therefore, we can never be certain of the truth value of anything, except for mathematics. The reason that the dream argument is flawed is that it assumes that a dream is a real thing. The reason that this is a fallacy is that there is no such thing as a dream, as it is an experience. This is because there is no evidence that dreams exist (outside of our experience), so there is no reason to believe that dreams are real.

{"original_text": "Uber is having a very public fight right now with NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, basically arguing that they should be allowed to compete with yellow cabs in a free market. I think they should be allowed to compete, and I'm happy to be an Uber customer, but this post is about why I think Uber is a far less threatening competitor to yellow cabs than they might seem. The argument is that since Uber does not have to purchase a medallion (a city-issued license to operate a taxi), and since they do not have to maintain the same equipment or training standards, they can be an unstoppable competitor that will undercut yellow cabs on price, safety, or both.

I think they should be allowed to compete, and I'm happy to be an Uber customer, but this post is about why I think Uber is a far less threatening competitor to yellow cabs than they might seem. The argument is that since Uber does not have to purchase a medallion (a city-issued license to operate a taxi), and since they do not have to maintain the same equipment or training standards, they can be an unstoppable competitor that will undercut yellow cabs on price, safety, or both.

And if we did, there would be no reason not to amend the Constitution so that each citizen of the United States would have an equal vote in the Senate. We could easily imagine doing away with the Senate altogether. A unicameral legislature would be easier to work with, since there would be no need for bills to be passed back and forth between the two houses. But this would mean that the members of Congress would serve only as representatives of their constituents, and not of their states. It would be harder to argue that each state should be represented in the federal government. What this comes down to is the question of whether each state is a distinct entity, or whether it is merely a set of counties with certain similarities. The question is whether a state is sovereign, or merely part of a union. In the 1780s, it was a matter of contention whether the union would be one of sovereign states, or a single nation. The Constitution established the states as sovereign entities, with limited powers granted to a central government. When we ask whether a state is sovereign, the question really has two parts. The first is whether the people of a state have the right to secede from the union. The second is whether a state has a right to make laws that are not in line with the laws of the federal government. The first question is moot; the answer is no, since the federal government has a monopoly on the use of force in the country, and would crush any attempt at secession. The second question is still relevant. States should have the right to make laws that are not in line with federal laws, but they should not have the right to secede from the union. The idea of a right to secede from the union is absurd. It could easily lead to chaos. In the same way that a man does not have the right to kill another man because he wants to separate from him, a state does not have the right to secede from the union.

I want to make this point clear - I am NOT debating whether or not it is goodbad when a woman engages in behavior that is typically defined under the scope of \"slut.\" That is another argument altogether. I am only asserting that the difference in reaction the majority of people have when they hear about the sexual exploits of either gender is, in general, justified. The reason for this, of course, is biological. It is generally imperative for males to propagate their DNA throughout many different potential mates as possible, to ensure the survival of his line. Historically, however, females had to be more restrictive with who they engage in intercourse with, because they were then strapped with the burden of taking care ofraising a child as a product of the encounter. The brains, hormone profiles, and physiology are disparate between the genders to reflect, in part, these differences in motivation. Given these differences, the crux of my argument boils down to this: it is simply more difficult for a heterosexual man to attain sex, than a woman, ceterus paribus. Once again, to be very clear, I'm not making any moral claims about being a slut; I'm simply stating the difference in difficulty in accomplishing the same task, and the justification of the subsequent reaction. To illustrate this point, I would like to I highlight the scenario of Bob. Bob built a business from the ground up; through sheer hard work and determination, he came from nothing, and now runs a company of hundreds of employees, making millions in revenue. Now, here is Patrick. Patrick also has a company of hundreds of employees, making million dollars in revenue, through his hard work and determination. The difference between Bob and Patrick is this - Bob had absolutely zero dollars in his bank account when he started his business, while Patrick inherited over 5 billion from his father's trust fund. So, even though both have technically accomplished the same thing, it would be fair to say that Bob deserves higher praise. The difference being, of course, while the task itself was the same, the difficulty level of either party to achieveaccomplish this task is significantly different. In the same way, we can assert that (all things being equal) it is much more difficult for a man to sleep with many women, than the reverse. Now, anticipating potential rebuttals, I would like to highlight other scenarios using the same logic above: I believe that heterosexual men (and homosexual women) deserve more praise than homosexual men for the same acts. To what degree, I'm honestly not sure, as I'm not an expert in biologysociology of this kind, but using the biological argument for the difficulty of the task, I would say that homosexual men hooking up is generally easier than the other scenarios.

{"original_text": "Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of researching the topic I've come to the conclusion that both sides are wrong. Just because you were vaccinated and you didn't get the disease you were vaccinated against, doesn't mean vaccinations work. All it means is that you were lucky. The arguments against vaccinations are actually quite compelling. Of course it's true that the side effects can be very serious, but the side effects of the diseases you are protecting yourself against are even more serious. I've read both sides of the argument, and the anti-vax side seems to have more concrete data to back up their position. It is definitely worth reading through their arguments. It's not just the vaccine companies that have a conflict of interest. The CDC is at least as bad. It's important to note that all sides of this argument agree that vaccines can cause very serious health problems. They all agree that some people will suffer from vaccine damage. They simply disagree on the rate of occurrence. The anti-vax side argues that vaccine damage is far more common than the medical establishment is willing to admit. The CDC argues that vaccine damage is very rare, but they have no data to back up their claim. The best data we have for rates of vaccine damage comes from the anti-vax side, which suggests that the rate is 1 in 30. This comes from the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. The CDC may be wrong, but they are still a lot closer to the truth than the anti-vax side. We all know how statistics can be used to manipulate people. The anti-vax side is only looking at the damage that is caused by vaccinations. They don't look at the damage that would be caused by the diseases. The anti-vax side is arguing that 1 in 30 people will be damaged by vaccines, and the CDC is arguing that the rate is 1 in 100,000. That means that the anti-vax side is ignoring the other 99,999 people who would have been damaged by the disease if they weren't vaccinated. If you look at both sides of the argument, it's clear that the CDC has a lot more data to back up their position than the anti-vax side. The anti-vax side is trying to hide the evidence of vaccine damage by lumping it together with damage caused by the disease. It's clear that they are playing a numbers game here. The anti-vax side is arguing that vaccine damage is \"minimal.\" If you ever come across someone who uses the word \"minimal\" to describe the side effects of something, you can be absolutely certain that they are lying. The only time the word \"minimal\" is used to describe the side effects of something is when someone is trying to hide the truth. The anti-vax side is arguing that the only reason that vaccinations are necessary is because of \"herd immunity.\" If vaccines worked, then herd immunity wouldn't be required. This is an attempt to hide the fact that vaccines don't work. If vaccines worked, then it wouldn't matter how many people were vaccinated because the disease wouldn't be able to spread. The anti-vax side is arguing that herd immunity is needed because vaccines don't work. The anti-vax side is arguing that the only reason that vaccines are necessary is because of \"herd immunity.\" The reason that herd immunity is needed is because vaccines don't work, and they are trying to cover up that fact. The anti-vax side is arguing that vaccines are necessary in order to protect those who cannot be vaccinated. That's a good point, but it doesn't explain why people who can be vaccinated should be vaccinated. The anti-vax side is arguing that vaccines are not the sole cause of a disease, so they must work. If you take this argument to the extreme, it means that vaccines are completely useless. The anti-vax side is arguing that vaccines are not the sole cause of a disease, so they must work.

{"original_text": "Disclaimer: this talk of secession may not be present everywhere in the United States, but it is more than prevalent where I live, so I'm going off that. To me, the idea of secession is one of the more ludicrous arguments I've heard from the Tea Party, but I'll let you decide that for yourself. I. Thoughts on Secession A. The Argument for Secession First and foremost, I must point out that the proponents of this movement are basing their argument on a flawed premise. The Constitution is not a contract between the states. The Constitution is a contract between the people and the government, and the people of the United States are not asking for secession. Nor are they demanding secession. The only ones who are making that demand are the Tea Partiers and other right wing ideologues who are now the only people in the United States who are demanding this. The argument for secession is a flawed one. The Constitution was written to create a more perfect union, and the only way to change it is through amendment. If the proponents of secession had their way, the Constitution would be amended to disallow the secession of states. This is because the people of the United States want to keep this country united, even if those who want to secede do not. It's funny, because the Tea Partiers are touting secession as an exercise of their freedom, but it infringes on the freedom of the rest of the country. The idea of secession is the exact opposite of freedom. This argument falls apart when you realize that the Constitution is a contract between the people and the government, not a contract between the states. B. The Way Forward The Tea Party and other right wing ideologues want secession, but they aren't the majority. There is no movement on the left to secede. There is no movement from the center to secede. There is no movement from the right to secede, except for the most extreme right, and that's a small minority. A lot of people have been saying that the Tea Party's extreme right wing ideas are going to be the death of the Republican Party, but I don't think that's true. I think it will result in a split in the Republican Party. The Republican Party will likely split into a center right party and an extreme right party. The center right party will be a more moderate party, and it will be a much better option for the left to work with. The extreme right party will be a small party of crazy people, and it will be a good thing to let it go. At this point, the argument against secession is a moral one. There are no logical arguments against secession, but there are moral ones. The only ones who want secession are the most extreme ideologues. They are not a majority, nor do they represent the majority. II. The Way Forward The way forward is to deal with the Tea Party with an open mind. Don't assume that they're all racists. That's an unjust assumption, and it's also inaccurate. Not all of them are racists. In fact, most of them are not racists. The way to deal with the Tea Party is to ignore the racists and work with the other ones. If you take the time to look at what the Tea Party is saying, you'll see that most of their ideas are actually really good. They're just not all good. The way to deal with them is to take the good parts and discard the bad parts. This is not always an easy thing to do, but that is the way that the Republican Party has to go if it wants to remain viable. The way forward is a movement toward the center. The current Republican Party is a party of extremists. This is not what is best for the country. The country needs a center right party and a left leaning party. It does not need an extremist party. III. Conclusion The way forward is to the center. The way forward is to deal with the Tea Party with an open mind and to work with the moderates. There are some real good ideas coming from the Tea Party, and it would be a shame if they were dismissed out of hand. We must take the good with the bad, and we must work to the center. We must build a strong center and leave the extremes behind. We have more to gain from reaching across the aisle than we do from yelling at each other across it.

According to a Pew Research Centre report, nearly 38 of college-aged individuals have a tattoo. While that is not a majority by quite a margin, it is a significant amount. Additionally, the popularity and accessibility of tattoos are steadily increasing year by year leading to a greater acceptance amongst a younger crowd. The point here is that because of their widespread nature, tattoos are no longer seen as a sign of rebellion simply because they are so commonplace. Furthermore, most colleges prefer to accept or deny students based on their applications alone, rather than on interviews. Unlike a job interview, in which personal image can make or break someone's chances of getting employment, colleges tend to focus more on scholastic and athletic merit, test scores, and lifetime achievements first.

{"original_text": "In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want to is seen as a major crime. In addition, other types of sexual assault, including groping, flashing, or rape are seen as serious offenses, and those who commit them are seen as horrible people who deserve whatever punishment society deems fit to give them. But why? Why do we think that the unwanted touching of another person's body is horrible and evil? Why do we insist that someone who forces sex on another person deserves the most severe punishment possible? Why is it that we do not allow an individual to touch another without their consent? It's because we understand that our bodies are our own, and no one else has the right to touch them. Forcing someone to have sex is stealing that person's body, using it for the pleasure of another. It is taking away that person's right to say \"no\" to sex and saying \"yes\" for them. Our bodies are our own, and we have the right to decide who touches them. If we do not consent to sex, then the other person must abide by that. It is not a person's right to have sex with someone who does not want to. In fact, it is a violation of that person's rights as a human being. No one else has the right to touch our bodies without our consent. The same is true for abortion. A fetus is a part of a woman's body. It is inside her, being nourished and cared for by her. It is growing within her. Forcing a woman to continue a pregnancy against her will is forcing her to give up her body for the use of another. It is taking away her right to control her body and saying \"yes\" for her. It is violating her rights as a human being. If we understand that forcing someone to have sex is wrong, then we should also understand that forcing a woman to continue a pregnancy is also wrong. We must protect every person's right to control their own body, not just when it comes to sex. It is a violation of a woman's right to her own body to force her to continue a pregnancy against her will. It is a violation of her humanity. Image source: Labels: abortion, bodily autonomy, consent, rape culture Yesterday, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a decision in the case Whole Woman's Health vs. Hellerstedt. In a 5-3 decision, the Court decided that HB2, a Texas law that would have closed all but 9 abortion clinics in the state, was unconstitutional. The law placed burdensome regulations on abortion clinics, requiring them to have the same facilities as an ambulatory surgical center, and requiring their doctors to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. To understand why HB2 was unconstitutional, we must first understand what the Constitution says about abortion. The Constitution does not specifically mention abortion. The Court did not find that the Constitution, as written, guarantees a right to abortion. However, the Constitution does guarantee every person the right to liberty, including the right to privacy. In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled that abortion was covered under the Constitution's right to privacy in the case of Roe v. Wade. The Court found that the Constitution guaranteed every woman the right to make her own decisions about her body, and abortion was a part of that. The Court also found that the Constitution guaranteed every person the right to privacy. What the Supreme Court did not do in Roe v. Wade is find that abortion is a constitutional right. The Constitution does not specifically say anything about abortion, and the Supreme Court ruled that it does not specifically guarantee a right to abortion. In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruled that states could not place undue burdens on a person's right to have an abortion. If the state places burdens on a person's ability to get an abortion, then it must have a compelling interest in doing so. The state's interest must be very strong in order to place any burdens on the right to an abortion.

{"original_text": "I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was shocked to find that the storyline of this film, like so many others, is based on some very serious distortions of the truth. I was also disappointed that the media and many others are praising the film for its representation of Alan Turing, when in fact it does a great injustice to him. First, the film portrays Alan Turing as a highly autistic loner who is antisocial and awkward around others, and who has trouble understanding people. This is not a true representation of Alan Turing, who was a well-rounded, likable person. He was social, kind, and capable of getting along with others. He had a great sense of humor and was known for his warmth and humor. He was widely known and well-liked in the community. I have read that he was even asked to join the MI6, but declined. I have read that the makers of the film even went so far as to delete a scene where Turing shows a genuine interest in a woman, because they felt it didn't fit the storyline of a lonely, autistic, awkward mathematician. They chose to portray him as such instead of being true to who he really was. The film also portrays him as a very slow, clumsy runner, when in fact he was a fast runner, and he won first prize in a cross-country race in 1928. Second, the film portrays the turning point in the war as a result of Alan Turing's \"breakthrough\" in cracking the Enigma code, when in fact the turning point in the war had already occurred well before then. The film portrays the Germans as capable of changing the codes of their encryption every day, so that the Enigma codes were constantly changing and therefore impossible to crack. However, this is not true. In fact, the Germans did not change their codes every day, and in fact they used the same codes for periods of several days or even weeks, during which time they were vulnerable to decryption by the British. The Enigma codes were actually cracked by Polish mathematicians before the war began. The Polish mathematicians and cryptographers gave their information on the Enigma to the British at the beginning of the war, but the British did not follow the Polish lead. They chose to use less sophisticated methods of decryption during the first years of the war. The British cryptographers were able to decode some German communications during this time, but they had trouble decoding some of the more sophisticated Enigma codes. The turning point in the war occurred when the British finally followed the Polish lead and began using the method of decryption the Polish mathematicians had shown them. The Enigma codes were cracked well before Alan Turing arrived at Bletchley Park. When he arrived there, he was assigned the job of building a machine to help the British cryptographers decrypt the Enigma codes, and he was successful in doing this. However, the film implies that this machine was the breakthrough that led to the British finally being able to decode the Enigma codes. In fact, the decoding of Enigma had already begun well before the arrival of Alan Turing. The Polish cryptographers had already shown the British the method of decryption they needed. It was not until much later in the war that Alan Turing's machine was built and contributed to the decoding of the Enigma codes. I am not saying that Alan Turing was not an important person or that he did not make important contributions. I am only saying that the film does not portray him accurately. I believe that the makers of this film took liberties with the truth so they could make him appear more dramatic, and to make their film more interesting to the public. By the time I finished reading up on Alan Turing after watching the film, I was disgusted by the filmmakers' blatant distortion of the truth, and I had lost all respect for the film. It is a shame that Alan Turing was not able to receive the recognition and respect he deserved during his lifetime, and that his life ended tragically as it did. But I think it is even more of a shame that his life is now being distorted for the sake of entertainment. This is not the way Alan Turing should be remembered.

I have read that the makers of the film even went so far as to delete a scene where Turing shows a genuine interest in a woman, because they felt it didn't fit the storyline of a lonely, autistic, awkward mathematician. They chose to portray him as such instead of being true to who he really was. The film also portrays him as a very slow, clumsy runner, when in fact he was a fast runner, and he won first prize in a cross-country race in 1928. Second, the film portrays the turning point in the war as a result of Alan Turing's \"breakthrough\" in cracking the Enigma code, when in fact the turning point in the war had already occurred well before then. The film portrays the Germans as capable of changing the codes of their encryption every day, so that the Enigma codes were constantly changing and therefore impossible to crack. However, this is not true. In fact, the Germans did not change their codes every day, and in fact they used the same codes for periods of several days or even weeks, during which time they were vulnerable to decryption by the British. The Enigma codes were actually cracked by Polish mathematicians before the war began. The Polish mathematicians and cryptographers gave their information on the Enigma to the British at the beginning of the war, but the British did not follow the Polish lead. They chose to use less sophisticated methods of decryption during the first years of the war. The British cryptographers were able to decode some German communications during this time, but they had trouble decoding some of the more sophisticated Enigma codes. The turning point in the war occurred when the British finally followed the Polish lead and began using the method of decryption the Polish mathematicians had shown them. The Enigma codes were cracked well before Alan Turing arrived at Bletchley Park. When he arrived there, he was assigned the job of building a machine to help the British cryptographers decrypt the Enigma codes, and he was successful in doing this. However, the film implies that this machine was the breakthrough that led to the British finally being able to decode the Enigma codes. In fact, the decoding of Enigma had already begun well before the arrival of Alan Turing. The Polish cryptographers had already shown the British the method of decryption they needed. It was not until much later in the war that Alan Turing's machine was built and contributed to the decoding of the Enigma codes. I am not saying that Alan Turing was not an important person or that he did not make important contributions. I am only saying that the film does not portray him accurately. I believe that the makers of this film took liberties with the truth so they could make him appear more dramatic, and to make their film more interesting to the public. By the time I finished reading up on Alan Turing after watching the film, I was disgusted by the filmmakers' blatant distortion of the truth, and I had lost all respect for the film. It is a shame that Alan Turing was not able to receive the recognition and respect he deserved during his lifetime, and that his life ended tragically as it did. But I think it is even more of a shame that his life is now being distorted for the sake of entertainment. This is not the way Alan Turing should be remembered. A very good article on the misrepresentation of Alan Turing's life in the film is here."}
{"original_text": "I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. I don't mean the details of who won the military victory, nor who took what territory, nor who ended up owning which country. I'm talking about the values of the winner. The values of the people who ended up running the show. The winner of the second World War was the USSR. I know that's not what history books say. And I'm not suggesting that the USSR is the one that became the new superpower. But the USSR was the one that dictated the course of the post-war world. And what was it that the USSR stood for? It was totalitarianism, and the most extreme form of it. It was central planning, and the most extreme form of it. It was centralisation, and the most extreme form of it. It was collectivism, and the most extreme form of it. It was a total lack of individualism, and the most extreme form of it. In short, the USSR was everything that the USSR stood against. And that's why the USSR won the second World War. And the USSR left a legacy. The legacy of the USSR's victory is everywhere. It's central banks. It's welfare states. It's over-regulation. It's over-taxation. It's lack of freedom. It's the War on Drugs. It's the War on Terror. It's the War on Privacy. It's the War on Anything Else. It's the pervasive fear that the State will come for you at any moment. It's the belief that the State is the only thing standing between you and the barbarians at the gate. It's the belief that the State is the arbiter of all moral decisions. It's the belief that the State is the arbiter of all economic decisions. It's the belief that the State is the arbiter of what you can and can't do with your own body. It's the belief that the State is the arbiter of what you can and can't say. It's the belief that the State can control the value of the money in your pocket. It's the belief that the State can create and destroy markets. It's the belief that the State can decide who you can and can't trade with. It's the belief that the State can and should make decisions about your healthcare. It's the belief that the State should decide who can enter and exit the country. It's the belief that the State can and should decide what you can and can't consume. It's the belief that the State should determine how you spend your time. It's the belief that the State should control your children. It's the belief that the State can take your property at will. It's the belief that the State can imprison you. It's the belief that the State can execute you. It's the belief that the State is the only thing protecting you from all the other people who are only out to steal your wealth, and take your property, and kill you. It's the belief that the State is the only thing that can protect you. It's the belief that the State is the only thing worth protecting. I could go on, but I think you're getting the point. The USSR won the second World War. And the United States lost. How did this happen? How did the winner of the second World War become the loser in the second World War? It happened because the people who won the second World War didn't want to lose what they had won. They didn't want to lose the moral high ground. They didn't want to lose the economic high ground. They didn't want to lose the social high ground. They didn't want to lose the political high ground. They didn't want to lose the technological high ground. They didn't want to lose the intellectual high ground. They didn't want to lose the economic high ground.They didn't want to lose the military high ground. The people who won the second World War didn't want to lose what they had won. But they did lose. They lost everything. The USSR lost the second World War.

However, I'd say that according to the traditional Sith myths (including the Bane and post-Bane era), he was the least influential and least \"Sith\" out of everyone.

{"original_text": "With the advent of self-driving vehicles, the unavoidable will become clear: people are terrible drivers, and operating your own car is unacceptably reckless if a better alternative exists. I see three possible outcomes: 1. The self-driving cars will be excellent drivers, but not good enough to make up for the extremely bad driving of the remaining human drivers. This will be a long-term death spiral as the remaining human drivers get worse and worse. 2. The self-driving cars will be so good that they become effectively mandatory. At this point, it's as if they've eliminated human driving altogether. 3. The self-driving cars will be so good that the remaining human drivers are completely eliminated. Therefore, I don't think that we're going to see a transition period with both self-driving cars and human drivers on the road. It's going to be one or the other. It's likely to be much sooner than you think: A certain tech company will be releasing a self-driving car within a year or two. Google does not release products, they are acquired or close up shop. Wow! That's a pretty good timeframe. I'm guessing that it'll be a one-shot effort in an urban area. Regarding Google, they have released products in the past, though I agree that they're more likely to get acquired. My guess is that they will try to release it in a controlled environment, like a geofenced area of a city where they can guarantee there are no pedestrians. If the self-driving car hits a pedestrian, they will lose all public support for their technology and the project will be shut down. I think you might be surprised. The public is not stupid. People know that they're terrible drivers. I think you might be surprised. The public is not stupid. People know that they're terrible drivers.My apologies for the thread hijack.

If you are referring to the general population of licensed drivers, I think your post is fairly accurate. This. How many people do you think would voluntarily give up their car in exchange for a self-driving car, in the absence of a compelling reason to do so? The real question is, how many people would give up their car in exchange for a self-driving car, in the absence of a compelling reason to do so? That's a very different question. The average person doesn't have a good enough understanding of statistics to evaluate the risk of self-driving cars. They'll probably believe that they are worse than human drivers (because they are better drivers than the average human driver, and they'll assume that the statistics they see are for the average driver). Things may be different if the statistics are released per vehicle and not per driver. Also, keep in mind that we're not talking about technology in its early stages here, we're talking about a technology that's already safe enough to be allowed on the roads in a few states. In other words, we're talking about a technology that's on the cusp of being mass-produced. Of course, I expect that the transition to fully automated vehicles will be a slow process. I don't expect fully automated vehicles to be as common as human-driven vehicles within the next decade, but they may be as common as human-driven vehicles within the next 20 years. I think you're making a bunch of assumptions that might not hold. This is certainly true, but I think that the people that care enough about the technology to keep up with it have a better understanding of statistics.

But, that is not the answer either. Work should be beneficial to the person, not a burden. But, in the end, that is up to each individual. They have been saying this since the 30s. Keynes predicted that as technology increased and our material needs would be met, we would only need to work 15 hours a week, and the rest of the time would be spent on leisure. I think it is our fault we do not have this. We have been forced by our capitalistic society to continue to compete with one another. We have been fed lies such as \"hard work\" will pay off, when in reality, if you're in a certain position in a capitalistic society, you will be crushed under the boot of the top 1. They also keep us divided with racism, religion, and politics, in order to keep us arguing with one another, and not pay attention to the bigger picture. Absolutely. That is the reason that I support a resource based economy. The problem with a resource based economy is that it ignores the very human need to work. The problem is that people need to work. This is true. And the need to work is also a human need. But in a resource based economy, people would not have to work to get the resources. They would just have to use them. But I would rather be a person that is not a robot, and not have my humanity taken away. People are capable of more than just being robots. We can build robots that can do all the work for us. Then we can spend our time doing things that make us feel human, like the arts. It would also be a better world, if we did not have to work so hard. People could do more things that made them feel human. Why do you think that it would be good for people to be robots?"}
{"original_text": "I'm generally a fan of the away goals rule: it encourages more attacking play, and makes the second leg of the tie exciting when a solitary goal can turn a loss into a win. However, after 180 minutes of even play, I think it's unfair for the away goals rule to apply in extra time. Both teams have had 90 minutes at home and 90 minutes away. It's unfair that the away team in the second leg gets 30 extra minutes to score an away goal. If both teams score in extra time, the tie should go to penalty kicks, not go down as a win for whichever team was playing away from home in the second leg. I especially feel that this is true, because when the draw is seeded, the better team plays at home in the second leg. If anyone is going to be given an advantage, it should be the better seed who earned it with better play in the group stage or qualifying round. So, change my view.", "label": "1", "is_selected": "0", "text": "I'm generally a fan of the away goals rule: it encourages more attacking play, and makes the second leg of the tie exciting when a solitary goal can turn a loss into a win.

{"original_text": "EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis) used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People have emotions, and emotions can be powerful and difficult to manage. Triggers are not a real thing, and they are not a real reason to not do anything. Everyone is an idiot. I am one, and so are you. It is important to understand that fact, and then to realize that it doesn't matter. This is not a self-deprecation thing, it's just that we are all terrible at being humans. We make mistakes, we make assumptions, we make judgments, and we all act based on those assumptions and judgments. None of them are perfect. All of this is fine, so long as you accept the fact that you are an idiot. We have all been idiots at one time or another. We have all made assumptions about people, acted on those assumptions, and then regretted it, or been met with the backlash of those actions. In the end, the only way to avoid being an idiot is to not do anything. Don't interact with anyone, don't do anything, don't say anything, don't have opinions about anything. All of these things are potential sources of idiocy. So, how do we deal with this? How do we avoid being idiots without just shutting down, and not doing anything? You just need to get used to it. I don't mean that you need to be ok with making mistakes, or being idiots. You will, as long as you are doing anything at all. You need to be able to accept that you will make mistakes, and you will make people uncomfortable, or sad, or angry, or whatever. We are terrible at communicating with one another. We suck at it. We have no idea how to do it properly. So, the most important thing is to stop worrying about it. Don't worry about being an idiot. Don't worry about making people upset. Just do what you want to do, and accept that people will get upset. That's just the way it is. I have written this post for me, as much as for anyone else. I feel like I am being attacked by people who are attacking me for being an idiot. I need to just accept that, and stop worrying about it. I am an idiot. I will make mistakes, and people will be upset. That's just how it is. I think this is an important lesson to learn. It's something I am still working on, but I think it's important to keep in mind. The other thing that comes from this is something I really love about the gaming community. The community here accepts that people will mess up. It is ok to be an idiot here. It is ok to say dumb things. It's ok to say things that are inappropriate. It's ok to say things that make other people uncomfortable. It's even ok to say things that are in support of terrible, horrible, things. The community here will call you on it. It will give you a hard time. It will tell you that you have done a bad thing. That's awesome. We need that. It's important to have a community that is able to call out terrible things. It's important to have a community that is able to tell us that we are being idiots. That's awesome. We need to accept that part of being a human is being an idiot.

He has a unique writing style that feels almost like prose poetry, and he uses it to create some of the most evocative, interesting worlds that I have ever read. His book, Embassytown, is about a world where the language is everything. In the book, the language is the reality. The language is a language of truth, and lies are not possible. In the book, the aliens are trying to communicate with a race of people that speak in lies, and lies are poisonous to their very minds. In the book, people are literally killed by the lies of language. It is a fascinating concept, and the book is great. What is interesting about the book is that the aliens are not a metaphor for anything. They are not an allegory. They are not a reference to some other thing", "label": "0", "is_selected": "1", "text": "In our series of letters from African-American journalists, film-maker, and columnist Richard Roeper looks at why it is important to not do anything if you are an idiot."}
